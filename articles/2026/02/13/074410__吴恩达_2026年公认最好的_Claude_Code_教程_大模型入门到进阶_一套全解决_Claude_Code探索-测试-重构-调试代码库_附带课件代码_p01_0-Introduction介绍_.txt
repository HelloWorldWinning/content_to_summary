Welcome to Cloud Code, the highly-agientic coding assistant this short course is built in partnership with Anthropic and Anthropic's Edithy Shobic is back to share with us the practices of how to use Cloud Code. I'm really excited about this short course. Cloud Code is my personal favorite coding assistant right now and it has boosted my and many other developers' productivity by a large margin. And it is a tool with a lot of depth to it. And so we want to get together with Anthropic to teach hopefully the definitive course on all of the most important ideas behind how to use it in a systematic way. Thanks, Andrew. I'm excited to be back here and start like you mentioned from explaining what the tool is, how it works, all the way towards using it in parallel with many different tools, including get work trees and MCP servers. What I've seen over the last couple of years is AI assisted coding has evolved rapidly. It started from maybe people asking OMs occasional coding questions to then GitHub autocomplete to then your various tools that became more and more autonomous. And Cloud Code, when it was released, was definitely a step up in terms of the degree of agency or the amount of stuff that the coding assistant could do by itself. And so I think many people are surprised that you could set a task that Cloud would work on for many minutes or sometimes even more than a few minutes. And now there are developers that are orchestrating not just a single Cloud instance, but even several of them working in parallel on different parts of a code base. But coordinating all this has to say the best practices that is not widely known. And if you have not worked with people close to best practices, I think they could be a big uplift still for mastering these best practices and knowing how they drive that amazing productivity that I've seen many developers have using Cloud Code. So as we start to talk about those best practices, a key tip for working with Cloud Code is providing clear context to help Cloud Code achieve the task you want efficiently. This means pointing Cloud Code to the relevant files, clearly describing the features and functionality that you want, and making sure that you're properly extending the capabilities of Cloud Code with MCP servers and other tools in that ecosystem. In this course, you'll apply those best practices to three different examples. We'll start with a rag chatbot, and you'll implement the features from the front end to the back end, including refactoring code, writing tests, and then using the GitHub integration to work with pull requests and fixing issues. You'll make use of many Cloud Code features, like planning, thinking modes, creating parallel sessions, and managing Cloud's memory. For the second example, we'll shift gears and work with Jupyter Notebooks to explore e-commerce data. We'll refactor notebooks using Cloud Code, remove redundant code, and create powerful dashboards with web applications. Finally, we'll move to create a visual mock-up based in Figma and use Cloud Code, the Figma MCP server, and a different MCP server to import the design, iterate, test, and build, agentically, a powerful front end application. If you are not currently a Cloud Code user, I think learning this set of ideas will give you a meaningful acceleration in the way that wish you can engineer systems. And even if you are a current Cloud Code user, I think having Ellie share these best practices with you in a comprehensive and systematic way, well, I hope leave you with quite a few new things you try that will be useful for your work. I'd like to thank from Devlan.ai, Hara Salami, who had contributed to this course. In the next video, Ellie will share Cloud Code's underlying architecture, and you might be surprised by how simple the architecture is. Cloud Code relies on just a small number of tools to search for patterns within your code files, so this directories look at files, do reg eggs. It does not rely on semantically embedding your code in a code base or transforming it into a social structure. And one of the things that I think has made Cloud Code effective is how it agentically can read through your code to take notes in a file called .md to figure out autonomously what is going on in your code base to then drive decision-making on how to advance your code. That's right. Because of that and not having a need to index a code base, you can ensure the code base stays local. We'll talk about some of the security ramifications with that. So let's get started, and I'll see you in the next video.
