Description:
以下是对文本核心思想的总结，并按照要求进行了组织：

**总结大纲**

I. **历史背景与长期挫折**
    *   过去四十七年间，围绕核问题的谈判持续进行，但被描述为“空谈”，未能取得任何实质性进展。
    *   这种长期僵局导致了巨大的生命损失，包括肢体残缺和面部损毁，给人们带来了深重苦难。
    *   批评对方长期以来只说不做，缺乏实际行动来解决问题。

II. **当前立场与坚定目标**
    *   表达了通过当前的“巨大力量”和“额外航母部署”来寻求一个“一劳永逸”的最终解决方案的决心。
    *   明确指出最终目标是实现“零核浓缩”，不接受任何形式的核浓缩。

III. **潜在行动与策略**
    *   暗示如果无法通过谈判解决，可能会采取军事行动，彻底摧毁核设施，并认为核尘埃是“任务中最不重要”的部分。
    *   拒绝讨论任何关于“接管”相关地区或实体的问题。

IV. **核心观点**
    *   尽管过去四十七年谈判徒劳且造成巨大伤亡，但现在拥有强大力量，目标是实现永久性的零核浓缩解决方案，并准备好采取行动。

**核心观点**

尽管过去四十七年谈判徒劳且造成巨大伤亡，但现在拥有强大力量，目标是实现永久性的零核浓缩解决方案，并准备好采取行动。

** overarching Framework**

what can the wrong do to avoid attack give us a deal that they should have given us a first time they give us a right here we want to do that but you know historically they haven't done that if they were i will say they want to talk but so far they do a lot of talking and no action when i was asked the president when they've already started do you want to be insane can run well it's uh... seems like that would be the best thing that could happen but forty seven years they've been talking and talking and talking to me time we've lost a lot of lives while they talk and legs blown off arms blown off faces blown off has been going on for a long time so i let's see what happens in the meantime me time we have tremendous power has arrived and additional powers you know another carriers going out shortly so we'll see it out if we could that it's settled for once and for all that would be good who do you want to take over what would you want to take over i don't want to talk about that but they're happy they're all very duffy since once a since then no no he's doing a great job if you said inside that the rated nuclear sites have been totally obliterated what's left to go after well you can get whatever the dust is down there uh... that's really the least of the mission if we do it that would be the least of the mission but we you know probably grab whatever's whatever's left it has been obliterated as you know would you accept anything less than zero nuclear enrichment i don't we don't want any enrichment we don't want enrichment thank you very much everybody
