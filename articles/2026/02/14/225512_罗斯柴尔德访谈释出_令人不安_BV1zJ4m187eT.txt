And it begins with three words, dear Lord Rothschild. Why was it that this letter was said by the foreign secretary to your great-uncle Walter? Jacob Rothschild, a name synonymous with wealth, power and influence, has long been associated with the creation of Israel. The story behind this connection is both shocking and intriguing, as Lord Rothschild reveals in this exclusive interview. Stay with us till the end of the video to find out all the fourth Baron Rothschild has to say about this in his disturbing interview that has been released. The interview. The second Lord Rothschild, Walter Rothschild, Walter Rothschild, was chosen as the recipient of the Balfour Declaration. Walter was an eccentric and colorful character, with a passion for collecting. He had amassed the largest collection of ornithological material in Great Britain, showcasing his wide-ranging interests. However, it was Walter's deep interest in the Zionist cause and his involvement in the early years of the establishment of pioneer communities in Israel. Walter's commitment to the Zionist movement made him a natural ally for the British government in their support for a Jewish homeland. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the Rothschild family was not united in their support for the establishment of a national home in Israel. Some members, like James Rothschild, who'd come from France, believed it was better to assimilate into English life and did not support the idea. Nevertheless, others like Dorothy de Rothschild played a critical role in advancing the Zionist cause. Dorothy, a major supporter of Israel from a young age, became instrumental in connecting with the British establishment and facilitating meetings with Zionist leaders. She married her cousin, James Rothschild, at the age of 17, and dedicated her life to advancing the cause of Israel after his death. Dorothy's passion, combined with her ability to navigate the highest echelons of British society, made her an important figure in the Zionist movement. The Balfour Declaration, with its three simple words, dear Lord Rothschild, marked a turning point in Jewish history. It was a testament to the power and influence of the Rothschild family, as well as their commitment to the Zionist cause. The declaration went through several drafts and compromises before its finalization, but its essence remained the same. A promise of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. The declaration, as Jacob Rothschild went on to reveal in the interview, further expressed the British government's support for the establishment of a Jewish home in Palestine. It was a monumental statement that held great significance for the Jewish community. The declaration stated, his Majesty's government views with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object. These words were a beacon of hope for the Jewish people, who had long yearned for a homeland of their own. However, the declaration also emphasized the importance of safeguarding the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. It was a delicate balance, ensuring that the establishment of a Jewish home did not come at the expense of the rights of others. This aspect of the declaration was crucial in maintaining peace and harmony in the region. The Balfour Declaration was seen as one of the most extraordinary moments in Jewish history. It was a culmination of 3,000 years of struggle and perseverance. For many it was nothing short of a miracle. The idea that an impoverished would be statesman like Chime Weizmann could persuade powerful figures like Walter Rothschild, Arthur Balfour and even Prime Minister Lloyd George to support the establishment of a Jewish homeland seemed unlikely, yet it happened. As good as the Balfour Declaration sounded, the reactions to it were varied. Within the Jewish community it was hailed as the greatest event in thousands of years. It was a moment of immense pride and joy, as the dream of a Jewish homeland was finally within reach. The declaration provided a sense of validation and recognition for the Jewish people, who had faced centuries of persecution and displacement. However, the declaration also faced criticism and opposition. Some argued that it did not go far enough in guaranteeing the rights of non-Jewish communities in Palestine. Others questioned the motives behind the declaration, viewing it as a political move by the British government to gain favor with the Jewish community. The implications of the declaration were far reaching. It set in motion a series of events that would shape the future of the Middle East and the Jewish people. The establishment of pioneer communities in Israel, with the support of the Rothschild family, marked the beginning of a new chapter in Jewish history. The Rothschild family also played a crucial role in the early years of the establishment of these pioneer communities. In France, Bernhard Lord Rothschild responded to the Russian pogroms in the 1880s, providing support and assistance to Jewish immigrants. In England, members of the Rothschild family, like Dorothy de Rothschild, dedicated themselves to advancing the Zionist cause and connecting with the British establishment. Interestingly, Jacob Rothschild not only revealed events of the past. In another interview, he shared his views about the future and how it can be built. When it comes to architecture, few partnerships have been as influential and enduring as that of Jacob Rothschild and Norman Foster. Their collaboration spans over four decades, beginning with their initial encounter alongside Jim Stirling and Richard Rogers. It was a meeting that would shape the course of architectural history. Rothschild vividly recalls the first time he laid eyes on Foster's work. It was at Reading, where he witnessed the early manifestations of Foster's architectural genius. The buildings exuded a sense of innovation and forward thinking that immediately captivated Rothschild. Little did he know that this encounter would mark the beginning of a lifelong friendship and a shared vision for the future. But it wasn't just the world of art and culture that Rothschild and Foster left their mark on. Their collaboration extended to projects that aimed to transform public spaces and enhance the urban experience. One such project was the pedestrianisation of Trafalgar Square, a historic landmark in the heart of London. In 1989, Foster played a pivotal role in the realisation of this ambitious endeavour, which sought to create a vibrant and accessible public space for all to enjoy. The successful completion of the project was a testament to Foster's ability to blend functionality, aesthetics, and the preservation of historical significance. Rothschild's admiration for Foster's work extended beyond their personal collaborations. As the chairman of the Pritzker Prize for Architecture, Rothschild had the privilege of being part of the committee that awarded Foster the prestigious prize in 1989. The decision was unanimous, as Foster's Millennium Bridge, a stunning architectural marvel that connected Somerset Heights, became a symbol of his ability to seamlessly blend the old and the new. So inspired by Foster's talent and vision, Rothschild sought his expertise in a project that held deep personal significance. The Baron Rothschild's greenhouse, once a sprawling oasis filled with exotic orchids, had been destroyed decades ago. The question of what to do with the site weighed heavily on Rothschild's mind. Together with Foster, they envisioned a project that would explore the future of farming, a subject of great importance in an ever-changing world. Their plan involved creating a modern structure on the site of the old greenhouse, showcasing innovative farming practices, and addressing the pressing issues of sustainability and food production. Simultaneously, they aimed to preserve the historical significance of the stable, a 19th-century building, by incorporating a modern intrusion that would juxtapose the old and the new. This harmonious blend of tradition and innovation would serve as a proof to the power of architectural creativity and the potential for a sustainable future. The transformation of the Baron Rothschild's greenhouse site into a visionary space dedicated to the future of farming became a focal point of their collaboration. The greenhouse, once a sprawling acre filled with vibrant orchids, had been lost to time, but its legacy remained. Rothschild and Foster saw an opportunity to reimagine the site and address the pressing issues surrounding agriculture and sustainability. In essence, the future of farming had become a live subject, and these two visionaries were determined to make a meaningful contribution. Other interviews.

His collection boasted an array of vintage models, showcasing the evolution of this ubiquitous device over the years. This early exposure to the world of collecting undoubtedly left an indelible mark on young Jacob Rothschild.

He has been a driving force behind numerous cultural initiatives, leaving an indelible mark on the artistic landscape. In this section we explore his pivotal roles as the chairman of the National Gallery and the Heritage Lottery Fund, as well as his dedication to the restoration and management of historic landmarks such as Spencer House and Wadsden Manor.

Through his leadership and support countless heritage sites have been restored and revitalized, allowing future generations to experience the grandeur and beauty of the past.

His family name, Rothschild, derived from the Red Shield on the house in the ghetto where his ancestors once lived. Intended for a career in the rabbinate, Maya's path took an unexpected turn when his parents passed away at an early age. Forced into an apprenticeship in a banking house, Maya quickly learned the intricacies of finance and developed a keen business sense.

Jakob settled in Paris in 1811 and Salomon and Karl opened offices in Vienna and Naples respectively in the 1820s. The Rothschilds capitalized on the wars by providing loans to warring princes, engaging in smuggling and legal trading of key products and facilitating international payments between the British Isles and the continent. Peace brought about a transformation in the Rothschild business. While they continued their international dealings, they increasingly became agents in government securities, insurance company stocks and shares of industrial companies. The family successfully adapted to the Industrial Revolution, investing in railway, coal, ironworking and metallurgical industries. Their ventures expanded beyond banking and finance, encompassing mining, energy, real estate and winemaking. By the mid-19th century, the Rothschild banking group had achieved a position of immense power and influence. However, their oligopolistic position faced serious threats from emerging joint stock banks and commercial banks in England, France and the German states. The last quarter of the century witnessed the decline of the Rothschild group as the leading banking consortium, with other groups in Europe and the United States surpassing them in strength and ambition. Despite the challenges, the Rothschild family's two guiding principles, conducting all transactions jointly and never aiming for excessive profits, helped them navigate the risks of passing down a business to future generations. While the successes of the founders were not all equally endowed, their remarkable capacity for seizing opportunities and adapting in business and politics remained a constant element in the group's history. The Rothschild family's rise to prominence was not solely based on their financial success. They also wielded significant influence in the political and social spheres of Europe. Their connections with ruling houses and their involvement in international finance allowed them to shape the economic and political landscape of the time. One of the key factors behind the Rothschild's influence was their ability to provide loans to warring princes during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. These loans not only secured their financial position, but also granted them access to the inner circles of power. Also in Britain, Lionel, Nathan de Rothschild made history as the first Jew to enter the British parliament. He became a member of the House of Commons in 1858, breaking barriers and paving the way for greater Jewish representation in British politics. The Rothschild's involvement in politics was not limited to Britain. They also held important positions in their respective countries, contributing to the political landscape of Europe. Alongside their financial and political endeavors, the Rothschilds were known for their considerable philanthropic activities. From the early 19th century, the family engaged in charitable work, particularly in the arts and education. They supported numerous cultural institutions, museums and universities, leaving a lasting impact on the world of arts and academia. Baron Philippe de Rothschild, for instance, became a premier winemaker and played a significant role in the vineyard Mouton Rothschild. His contributions to the world of wine and viticulture were not only commercially successful, but also elevated the Rothschild name in the realm of fine wines. Despite their immense wealth and influence, the Rothschilds faced challenges and hardships. During the Nazi period, particularly in Vienna and Paris, the family had to endure the persecution and seizure of their assets. However, they managed to preserve their unity and weathered the storm, emerging as a symbol of resilience and strength. And in recent years, the Rothschild family has continued to make significant contributions to society. Members of the family have excelled in various fields, including science, philanthropy and international finance. Their legacy, therefore, lives on, and their impact on the world remains no doubt undeniable. What do you think about Lord Jacob Rothschild and his interview? Tell us your thoughts in the comments.
