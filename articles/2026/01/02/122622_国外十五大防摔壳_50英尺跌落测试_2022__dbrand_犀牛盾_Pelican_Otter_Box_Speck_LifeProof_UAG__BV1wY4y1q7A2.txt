Description:
好的，这是根据您的要求从文本中提炼出的核心思想摘要。

### **核心内容概要**

#### **一、 测试背景与目的**

1.  **核心问题**: 随着手机本身耐用性（如iPhone的陶瓷护盾）的提升，手机壳在2022年是否依然是必需品？
2.  **测试设置**:
    *   **高度**: 50英尺（约15米）的高塔。
    *   **设备**: 多部iPhone 13系列手机。
    *   **标准化**: 所有手机均安装了统一的 "Rebel Glass" 屏幕保护膜，以确保测试的公平性。

#### **二、 各品牌手机壳测试结果摘要**

*   **失败 (手机损坏)**
    *   **Petaka MagEasy Case Pro**: 手机屏幕出现绿线，内部损坏。
    *   **Mouse Limitless 4.0**: 手机背部玻璃碎裂。
    *   **Apple Clear Case**: 撞击到底部裸露弱点，手机损坏。
    *   **Otterbox Commuter**: 手机从双层壳中滑出，导致损坏。
    *   **UAG Monarch**: 手机壳边角脱落，导致屏幕下方玻璃碎裂。

*   **半成功 (外观尚可，但手机弯曲或内部无响应)**
    *   **Casetify Bounce**: 手机弯曲且无响应。
    *   **D-brand Grip**: 手机弯曲，但功能正常。
    *   **Rhino Shield Solid Suit**: 手机严重弯曲，但功能正常。
    *   **Phone Rebel Flex Series (Pro版)**: 手机外观完好，但因机身更重导致冲击过大，无响应。

*   **成功 (手机功能与外观完好)**
    *   **Rebel Series Gen 3**: 手机完美幸存。
    *   **Speck Presidio II Grip**: 经历正面朝下撞击后，手机完好。
    *   **Lifeproof**: 手机壳自身破裂，但成功保护了手机。
    *   **Pelican Shield**: 手机完好。
    *   **Phone Rebel Flex Series (标准版)**: 短暂黑屏后恢复正常，成功幸存。
    *   **Phone Rebel Frosted Series**: 手机完美幸存。

#### **三、 核心发现**

1.  **外部完好 ≠ 内部安全**: 许多测试表明，即使手机的正反面玻璃没有碎裂，强大的冲击力依然会导致机身框架弯曲或内部主板损坏，使手机无法开机。
2.  **笨重 ≠ 绝对保护**: 一些以厚重防护著称的品牌（如Otterbox, UAG）在测试中也因设计问题（如手机滑脱、边角包裹性不足）而导致保护失败。
3.  **设计细节决定成败**: 保护壳的边角缓冲、材料选择和结构设计（如避免底部完全开放）是提供有效保护的关键。

---

### **核心结论 (一句话)**

即使现代手机的玻璃面板非常坚固，手机壳在2022年依然至关重要，因为高空跌落造成的冲击仍会导致手机内部损坏或机身弯曲变形。

---

### **内容总体框架**

该视频内容遵循一个标准的实验验证框架：

1.  **提出假设**: 引入“现代手机是否还需要保护壳”这一核心议题。
2.  **设定实验**: 明确测试标准，包括50英尺高度、统一的测试设备和配件，以保证变量可控。
3.  **执行测试**: 对十余款不同品牌和设计的手机壳进行逐一跌落实验。
4.  **分析结果**: 详细检查每部手机的损坏情况，并将其归类为“成功”、“失败”或“半成功”。
5.  **得出结论**: 基于所有实验结果，总结出手机壳的必要性，并强调冲击对手机内部和结构的潜在损害。

What's up guys, everything Apple Pro here returning for our annual top iPhone cases drop test at our 50 foot tower. Let's go ahead and test the latest and greatest iPhone cases. And of course the claims these companies put out as to being the best, most durable. Do you even need a bulky case when phones are this durable in 2022? We got ceramic shield on the 13 lineup and then titanium coming later this year supposedly on the 14 pros. So our case is obsolete or are they still needed? Let's do 50 feet of course in our regular style with a bunch of iPhones. Let's get to it. Alright so we got these bad boys here. We're going to start with the Petaka Mag Easy Case Pro. Using a very unique design process where the Kevlar goes over the sides with TPU, Fin. I actually really like it. Got to give props to Petaka. Love to see what they do and how they keep innovating. Oh and by the way to make this fair we have our new Rebel Glass 0.4 millimeters. Actually quite strong on all the phones being dropped today. We include three in our new release. What I like about this one is just how square the design is going with the natural chassis of the iPhone 3. 2. 1. Ooh. Not a survivor. I can see the green lines from here. Yikes. So straight on the bottom. Kevlar chipped. TPU held up well. Glass did not break but the phone did get dented through the case. There's just not enough material there. Why did dent there? Surprised that neither of the glasses broke. Definitely would not say that's a survivor. And green with the black Rebel series. Up this open, a slimmer case. There's that beauty. Glass included. Metal buttons. Super tight fit. And raised corner protection. Which I hope does well on this drop. Logic for this one was a slimmer case. Protection where you need it. Phones are getting more durable. So slimmer, more comfortable. Here we go. 50 feet. Rebel series. 3. 2. 1. And round with the slo-mo iPhone. And wow. Nasty impact there on the corner. But our clock corner seems to have saved it. And the ridge around the lens. Wow. Let's see what it looks like inside. Pretty much flawless. Wow. I am shocked. Rebel series Gen 3. Saved the day. Quite a lot of deformation in there. But better the case than your nearly $1000 phone. And next up, Mouse Limitless 4.0. These guys have been around for quite some time. Their name is known for super high drops and stunts. And we got the TPE on the insides. We have ours just in the corners because it pretty much is pointless on the sides. Kind of a round bubbly design. Some metric ports. Let's see if these still hold up. Definitely like their simple style. Don't like the banana wedge. Look, raised lips. Mouse Limitless 4.0. And 3. 2.1. Okay. Nasty gouge there. Oh wow. The back shattered. The rear it seems. Has consequences for no impact resistance. Just plastic here. And that one did not survive. So they used to have a microfiber. And they used to have a microfiber. And they used to have a microfiber. And they used to have a microfiber. And that one did not survive. So they used to have a microfiber in here. It seems that still is necessary as the back glass is not the new ceramic shield on the iPhones. Case to fight bounce. It's their all new release. Their most extreme case ever with these massive, at looking bumpers. Quite an extreme statement with this case. Actually, don't not like this one. The corners kind of dig into your palms. It makes a small phone feel big. Plastic x brace inside for structure. Case to fight bounce. This is a $90, $80 to $90 phone case. That's insane. Three, two, one. And not as much of a bounce as I thought. Let's see how it did. One of the corners came up. Oh, that's not too good. The phone is non-responsive. Glass is intact. The phone is a little bent. It seems. Impact point on the top here. That's a very strange one. The shock has went through the phone. It's non-responsive. Underneath the skin, it's okay. So half survivor. Always a classic, the D-brand grip. Got a nice marble skin on this one. This is their new one with MagSafe. Got the accompanying skin for it here. Also a banana style lip design. Very, very nice grip as the name suggests. Very simple design. In three, two, one. Screen is responsive. White the impact. Phone is bent. Besides the phone bending, it's all responsive. Glass is intact. Very simple design. Microfiber for shock absorption. Worked out very well. Great job, D-brand. Next up, we got the Rhino Shield Solid Suit in white. This one has no MagSafe. Plastic, honeycomb on the inside and sides. These usually don't do too well on the impact. Not a lot of places the shock can go. Very bright statement. Soap bar case. In three, two, one. Looks like our screen protector took the brunt of the impact. And underneath, the glass is intact. On the backside, also intact. Phone is only ever so slightly bent. Actually, well, that's quite a bend. But working. Next up is Phone Rebel Flex Series. This is our naked case. As you can see, it's unlike anything out there with the open sides. And claw design. So we've got the side protector films on. White dashing in the vivid red flex series. The most comfortable case because really it feels like there isn't one. On the iPhone 13. In three, two, one. Ooh, that's a back impact. And screen looks intact. Ooh, it just happened. I just touched it and it turned off. Did survive. As you can see, our claw corners. That little difference it made here. Kevlar is not scratched because these all took the brunt of the impact. Camera lens ring. And the phone is working after a quick time out and reboot. And next up, Apple's Clear Case. I haven't done one of these in a while. They have a wonderful clear sheen. Unfortunately, a completely exposed bottom. Vivid red in here. Apple's Clear Case makes the red 13 pop quite vividly. In three, two, one. Okay, that just hit the weakest point of the case. I don't think that one survived. Yep. Similar to the first drop here. Glass did survive, but unfortunately it hit the weakest point of the case. Which has left quite the impression in words here. Case is cracked and it's not a very durable one. Long-term. Otterbox commuter series. Probably one of their slimmest durable cases. Never did like these two-piece cases. High lips. Thick borders. Blue on blue works here quite well. In three, two, one. Quite a bit of aerodynamics at play. A grizzly sight. I didn't expect that honestly. Phone slipped out of a two-layer enclosure. And the glass did its job. Despite impact into the corner here, which is quite visible. I like the fact that you can't trust the bulky look. Now this one goes back to the teenager days. Speck with their new Presidio II grip based on the old iPhone 3G 3GS case designs. Nostalgic iPhone case. Two, one. Oh jeez. That's a face down one. This is one of those. Just gets unlucky I guess. Back is okay. Oh wow, I thought that was broken. No way. So the screen did survive. So that's our new .4 millimeter glass. It even breaks differently than other screen protectors. Super high aluminum content. Life proof next. This is a two-layer case. Separates like such. If it wasn't so bulky, I'd say this is a really cool design. Actually adds quite a bit of width. Three, two, one. Bottom impact. Lotter roll. What do we got here? Game over for the case. Plastic is fractured. Separated. But phone is intact. I guess that's part of the safety feature. Ejection. And we got a bit of an overkill here with the Pelican shield with Kevlar. One of the biggest cases I've ever seen in an age when it doesn't really need to be this way. Two layer. Definitely looks quite industrial and you're a mile away from your speaker ports. 21 feet military standard. And three, two, one. That's a face down one. A lot of deformation here. Deep views. Go on sideways. Screen protectors. Now cracked. Some concrete did get through. Otherwise, phone glass itself is intact. UAG Monarch. A design that hasn't really changed much. No magsafe. But tried in true performance. Really nice color here. A bulky, but still like it. One. And oh. Yeah, that one didn't do too well. So the corner slipped off. The glass screen protector survived. The glass underneath did not. Quite nasty impact. Oh, look at that. I think that's a first. The stainless band dislodged. Pushed the glass back. And it did survive. But the 13 Pro is done. As a bonus, we'll drop our phone-able Frosted Series. Gen 3. We'll see if the clear back holds up just as well as the Kevlar. So we brought the Frosted Series back. Feels very similar to the matte OEM feel of the Pro Series phones. Three. Two. One. Oh, I'm nervous. So it's right on the interior TPE impact point. And the phone has survived. The TPE bumpers did their job. These are designed to absorb shock where it's needed most on the corners in order for the sleek design to work everywhere else. And the last one just to bring the point home Flex Series. I'm going to drop this one in the new Alpine Green on the 13 Pro. So we'll see if the extra height between the screen and the ground can compensate for such an open design. 50 feet. This really is our baby as far as our products go. We started the company with this one. Definitely unique. The 13 Pro and Alpine Green. Three. Two. One. Two. Two. Two. It's a heavier phone too. Okay. So what do we got? That's an impact. That rocks embedded. Phone. Glass has not broken. Nor has the back, but it is not responsive. As far as the case goes, took the brunt of the impact. But unfortunately that shock, the heavier phone, there was nowhere else for it to go. Another half survivor here. The case is still highly recommended in 2022 as phones are still vulnerable to deforming and shock damage on the inside. We saw a lot of phones that just did not turn on after dropping. These are the good ones. So can't go wrong with them. Thanks for watching guys. Till next time.
