好的，这是根据您提供的文本内容和要求生成的分析摘要。

### **核心思想纲要**

1.  **时间旅行技术的起源与原理**
    *   **技术来源**: 该技术是对地球上很久以前发现的古老门户技术（可能源自外星）的复制与合成。
    *   **运作机制**:
        *   需要巨大的能量（如零点能源）。
        *   通过“空间内折”（infolding space）撕开时空，创造一个可穿越的裂口。
        *   模拟外星生物的旅行方式：创造独立的引力场，并利用能量在前方打开跨维度空间。
    *   **关键技术**: 采用“意识辅助技术”（consciousness assisted technology），设备与驾驶员的意识甚至DNA相连，驾驶员通过思想即可操控。

2.  **时间与多重现实理论**
    *   **时间的本质**: 时间并非线性存在，而是多维度、多层次的现实和频率的集合。我们是多维度的存有，同时存在于多个时空。
    *   **改变过去的影响**: 回到过去并做出改变（如除掉希特勒），并不会影响你当前所在的现实。这只会创造出一个全新的、独立的现实时间线。

3.  **具体应用与个人经历**
    *   **“特斯拉能量室”（Tesla Tron Unit）**:
        *   **医疗功能**: 可为精英阶层治疗癌症、艾滋病、疱疹等顽疾。其原理是通过强大的电磁频率，将体内的毒素、病毒、癌细胞等负离子成分“传送”出去，同时提升健康细胞的DNA频率，增强能量和认知。
        *   **时间扭曲副作用**: 在设备内感觉只过了15分钟，而外界实际已过去一个小时。使用者不会衰老，但会“失去”时间。
    *   **个人任务经历**: 曾参与过穿越门户执行任务的经历，任务内容是采集样本（岩石、植物等）。在任务中感觉只过去了15分钟，但返回后发现外界已过了三、四个小时。

4.  **技术的现状、风险与抑制**
    *   **技术不成熟与高风险**: 该技术尚未完善，具有极高的死亡率。叙述者提到他认识的一整个团队在一次任务中丧生。
    *   **技术被抑制的原因**: 尤其是其强大的医疗功能，因会颠覆传统医药产业的商业模式，而遭到大型制药公司（Big Pharma）的蓄意打压，使其无法向公众普及。

### **核心观点结论**

秘密项目中存在着源自外星技术、与意识相结合的时间旅行科技，但该技术不仅极度危险且不完善，其颠覆性的医疗功能更因商业利益而遭到蓄意压制。

### **整体内容框架**

本文内容构建于一个“内部揭秘者”的叙事框架之上，通过一位自称参与者的第一人称视角，揭示了在秘密项目中存在的、源于非人类或古代科技的先进时间旅行与医疗技术，并阐述了这些技术因其颠覆性而被刻意向公众隐瞒的“真相”。

Welcome to Cosmic Disclosure, I'm your host, George Norrie, and I'm here with Emery Smith. Time travel technologies, do they exist? And if so, how are they being used? Emery, welcome back. Thanks for having me, George. Time travel technologies, exactly what is it and what's involved with it? Well, what they're trying to do and replicate is portal technology that they have discovered from an earthly origin a very, very long time ago. And there is a connection between this type of traveling that also affects time and space. So they are trying to actually replicate that and make that into electronics and make a synthetic version of this. And they have, they have actually done this, they have not perfected it yet. Now, when you say they, who are we talking about? We're talking about the compartment, lies projects, that the security is only run by the military, but the project itself could be owned by, you know, major corporations that are clandestine that get funded by the governments around the world to make other technologies for them, whether it be for, you know, wartime peacetime or pharmaceutical. So these monies that are made from these smaller projects that they're doing funds their secret projects such as time travel and things like this. So specifically, Emery, how does time travel work? Because we hear all kinds of things and all kinds of possibilities. Well, the first thing you need is a lot of energy, number one. A lot of the side effects of these zero-point energy over unit devices create this type of rip-in time and space. And it has to do with infolding space on itself, actually, and opening up the space within time, you know, right here in front of you. Because that right there is how our extraterrestrials actually travel through the universe and interdimensionally. They're creating their own field of energy, number one, which is their own gravitational field that they sit in. That's why they can do these billion mile an hour or right hand turns and nothing happens to them because they're in their own field. And by putting energy and focusing it in front of these craft, they can actually open up interdimensionally a space, rift, and time and go through it. And that's why they sometimes just disappear in space. Do they have like a dial on any apparatus and they could click it to 3,015 and poof, you'll show up there? Well, it's kind of like that, but it's called consciousness assisted technology. And it's all done with their consciousness. The craft also are integrated with the beings. Some of them are actually grown, these craft, and they are matched to the DNA of the pilot. So all the pilot has to do is think of that dial turning to 350, whatever, degrees and poof. They're gone. Who they are? Yep. The more and more I watch you on cosmic disclosure, I hear new information that just boggles my mind. In this particular case, how do they use this kind of technology? Well, what they're doing is, like I said, time is a very sensitive subject with the physicists and the scientists around the world that are not part of the clandestine projects. Because it's a hard thing to grasp because time really doesn't exist. And what's going on is there's multiple levels of time right now and multiple different types of realities and dimensions. So there isn't a dimension right now, just within a different frequency right now, where you are here and I'm here, and it's just a little bit different. Maybe these coffee cups are not here, or the cameras, or might be some different people. Because there's many different levels. The hardest thing to explain is that time is irrelevant because you are already here everywhere, all the time, which means, and that sounds confusing. But don't go back and see your grandfather, right? Right. And that's a big question I get. Like, what if you go back in time and you did something? Well, you just created another time of reality. So that's another space of time. But you're still where you're at right now. And if you think you can go back and remove the coffee mug, and then all of a sudden, you know, it's not there, it doesn't work that way at all. I mean, if you wanted to go back into time and do away with Hitler, and prevent World War II, and the Holocaust, and all that horror that he created, what would happen if you went back into time, took care of him, got rid of him, and what would the consequences be? Consequences would not affect you, because in this reality, that never happened. Interesting. But would there be a reality somewhere? There is. What would happen? Correct. And what would happen there? Well, it's what's happening right now. That's the paradigm here, is trying to put all that together, saying, okay, there are multiple dimensional realities, and there's multiple different types of time zones that we are all part of. We are interdimensional, multiple dimension beings. And that's where frequency comes in with DNA and genetics, and how, you know, we affect, you know, other worlds, and other places in the universe, where the light we see from the stars today, the star might already be out. But because of this distance and time continuum, we don't really think about that and realize that. What if there are other universes, the multiverse exists? That's right. Would different time things occur in those different universes? Right, exactly. I get that question a lot too. So the different universes have, you know, another George and another Emory there. And at this time, you have to realize that it's a whole other timeline that we're part of, but we're not because we're here. That's the best way I could put it. These programs, I'll call them the time programs. Sure. Were you involved with them specifically? And if so, what did you do? Well, there was a program I was involved with where they were using a special type of Tesla Tron Unit, where we would take a watch in with us in this small Hegs of Gone room and spend, you know, supposedly 55 minutes in there. I remember the first time after working with this project for many years to even become one of the people to go into it, that you have two watches and you put one in your locker room, you lock it up, you take the other one with you into this device. And the first time after waiting two years to get into it, I was so thankful that I was finally able to get the proper security clearance and to get into this device. And going into this device as they ramp it up, I remember hearing after just 15 minutes, this knock at the door saying, you know, okay, Smith, it's, you know, you need to come out now, we're done. Cause I heard the system ramp up. Probably were in there nine years and they didn't know it. Exactly, I was in there for a whole hour. And I had no idea. When I came out, I was so upset. I was so distraught saying, man, what happened did the system have a malfunction? And then all the scientists are looking at each other and they're all like over a hundred years of age and they're laughing and they said, oh, didn't you check your watch and your locker? And I said, no. So, you know, I missed a good 30, 45 minutes. And you didn't even know it. And I did not know it because the 15 minutes I was in there, really, I felt, you know, it was amazing experience. You can see the universe, you can see space, you could, it actually detoxes you and teletransports toxins out of your body. Sometimes people lose up to 15 pounds in these trips that they go in there. In one sitting? In one sitting in 55 minutes. And I always asked, you know, well, where's that go? Because I still have the same hydration when they did the blood test. And I'm not dehydrated, but yet all the horrible, negative, ionic bacteria, viruses and metals in my body were taken out. So people that are really toxic that go in there, you know, really a lot of the stuff. They come back healthy. They come back very healthy. It's used to treat cancers for the elites of the world, even our presidents have been there. What's the machine that you like, Emory? It's a hexagon room. And inside the hexagon room is a glass wall. The hexagon room is only about eight feet in diameter. So you know, it can only fit a small massage table that's in there. And three feet beyond the massage table is a three inch glass or plexiglass wall. And behind that is this giant Tesla Tron unit. And it amps up this amazing electromagnetic frequency where it rips time and space apart. A lot of side effects of zero point energy devices do this. And a lot of scientists that have, including Tesla, have witnessed this and wrote this down that there's some field, this sphere that forms, which has happened to me in my laboratories, where, you know, the time is getting distorted for a moment. Sure. But with this device, they really perfected it pretty well. Where we always were trying to find out, wow, there must be some dimension somewhere where someone's sitting there, you know, maybe an extraterrestrial and a big wad of fat comes down and hits them in the face or some toxins, you know, someone just jumps a bucket of something. So it's not perfected yet because they're still trying to find out, well, where does that go? Where did the tumor go? Where did the cancer go, the cells? Where did these, these viruses go? So they're just gone. They're just gone. How does it work in terms of curing people? They're still trying to figure it out. And the best way I could describe it is it somehow attracts the negative ionic components of viruses and tumors and also metals that are not beneficial for the body. It latches onto them somehow through this energy field that's in there and it tele-transports those things out somewhere. It sounds like it also changes the bad cells. Does it? I don't think it changes the bad cells. I'm pretty sure it removes the bad cells, but it up-regulates the frequency of the DNA. It also helps fight infections and things like this. Usually once you get out of one of these devices, for me, I could not sleep for three days and be completely fine. You have a great urge to work out. I think I ran the furthest after having a treatment on one of these devices because I used to jog a lot and work out a lot. And that was very noticeable. And they said this would happen. They said you will have an immense amount of energy and you have an immense amount of cognitive function. And meditation was just amazing. You can immediately just close your eyes and be anywhere you want. If you were a good meditator and you knew how to do these regular meditation steps. So it has amazing functionality to the frequency of the DNA of the cell and the nucleolus of the cell. And also up-regulating those energies because it's all about keeping your body at the right voltage. And I think by removing the contaminants out of the body, which affects your voltage, it allows you to heal yourself. Interesting. In our studies, just with this one project, and there's many projects we'll talk about, but with this specific project, you're really going in there to get treated for something, for an ailment. But what the side effect is, is time. Right. It's losing time. You lose time. But you don't age. Right. Right. And that's why all these scientists in this underground facility in New York, actually, were so young and vibrant and over 100 years of age. And I remember working on some things for them just as a technician, listening to their conversations. And they were talking like they knew Tesla. And they had a lot of... They probably did. I know. It was electrifying to know, wow, I wish I really knew exactly how old they were. This is a civilian-owned device that was made from naval scientists that retired early. And it must be so perfected now, I would guess, right? Well, I think they're trying to do something. I tried to contact them a few years ago to see if we could maybe get this technology out to the public. And one of the head scientists became ill. And I had lost contact with that group. But we're still trying to figure it out. I think it's going to resurface soon because the medical benefits of this time-traveling device is unprecedented. We were able to cure HIV in 30 days, herpes and sick. Like being in the device? Just by being in the device three times a week. Does it cure everything? Well, I don't know about everything. Just the documentation I've seen and heard was with cancers and herpes and HIV, STDs. Because a lot of the- Well, why do they suppress all that stuff, everybody? Why don't they bring it to the public? Well, they have to. They'll probably definitely not approve that device no matter how much documentation they have. Why? Well, you're going up against Big Pharma, the big money maker. They need you to take these pills. So you're saying they don't want the cures? They do not want the cures. And I can attest to that being the inventor of the first table top stem cell concentrator and submitting many documents to the FDA of helping paralyze patients and things like this. And you can send in 1,000 studies of a new technology that many scientists have tried to do here in the United States. And nothing happens. And nothing happens. They say, oh, you need more data. So they just keep leading you on, leading you on. So you get so tired and you run out of money. Because most scientists and smaller corporations don't have that kind of capital to keep testing and testing and testing. We've talked about these scientists that you would see through this time device. And you said they were 100 years old. Where'd they come from? And why were they so old? Well, it's not that when I was inside the device, they're the ones who invented this device. And they were definitely born on Earth. They were all ex-military scientists that retired. They had worked with Tesla. They obviously had worked with Tesla the way I can hear them talking behind the scenes and joking around. They were all in excellent shape. They were all over 100 years of age. They're still aging. They didn't get that secret figured out yet. But the fact that these people in these compartment wise projects who have been there forever, by the way, these are civilian compartmentalized projects, but they are ran by ex-military scientists. Embry, how advanced are we, in your opinion, and based on things you saw, is our time travel program? How advanced is it? Well, they can do it. It's not that effective, such as I would probably say, a recent offer I got to come back to a project because the entire team had passed away during one of the missions. And it has a very, the mortality rate, it's not that great. So something happened or a dish. Something happened, and these were people I'd known for 20 years or more. They seemed a little emotional. Well, they were very close friends of mine in the projects. I haven't not talked to them in forever. But when I was notified of this position, I first thing I asked was, well, how is commander so-and-so? How is this person? How is that person? And they said, well, there was an incident. Oh, geez. And then I knew and they just said, that's why we want you. And so just like an astronaut that goes up the space to risk his life or to the moon, they go there knowing, they go there knowing that, you know, you might have just a 70% chance of survival. You know, there is these numbers and ratios that scientists come up with. So it's not worth me right now getting involved with these projects anymore because it's too dangerous because of everything I'm trying to get out to the world. But at the same time, it's good to know that they're still working on these projects to help figure out the physics behind them and the science. And a lot of these projects have mission-oriented goals for time travel. One of the missions I had been on as a young sergeant was to go through these types of portals and time travel devices to just collect certain amount of rocks and dirt and flora and fauna. And the future, I guess. And I don't know where exactly I was on the planet or even if I was on this planet. And we would only be gone. There's always a specific 15 minutes in and out. But as we get back, we've begun three or four hours in real time at this time. And when you came back, how much time had gone by? Three or four hours. So I was only gone 15 minutes. OK. And then everyone gets pulled out. That's not too long. It's not like you came back and 40 years had gone by. No. Correct. But I know space travel, this is where it gets into a big time thing. Further, you go away from the Earth that you're losing time, because time here is speeding up as you're not.
