Description:
好的，这是根据您提供的文本分析得出的核心思想摘要。

### **核心思想纲要**

1.  **核心威胁：来自古巴的风暴**
    *   **威胁根源**：古巴的局势比委内瑞拉更严重，其背后是一个由墨西哥、一个名为“克劳迪娅”（Claudia）的关键人物以及贩毒集团构成的“三股绳”邪恶联盟。
    *   **联盟活动**：该联盟通过古巴进行价值数十亿美元的毒品与人口贩卖，势力根深蒂固。
    *   **秘密军事行动**：
        *   **外部勾结**：古巴正在重温与俄罗斯的旧联盟（类比古巴导弹危机）。
        *   **秘密运输**：夜间有潜艇向古巴秘密运送包裹和物资。
        *   **内部设施**：古巴境内存在藏有军事物资（包括生物武器）的地下基地和洞穴。

2.  **具体的攻击计划**
    *   **攻击目标**：美国佛罗里达州的迈阿密地区。
    *   **攻击手段**：使用生物武器进行渗透和攻击。
    *   **执行方式**：通过被称为“骡子”（mules）的人员在夜间行动，运送装在带有特定符号的玻璃圆筒管（cylinder tube）中的生物制剂。

3.  **异象与象征**
    *   **紫色巨龙**：一条代表某种邪恶力量的紫色巨龙从水中三次升起，这是一个重要的象征性警告。
    *   **绿色的嫩芽**：在看到威胁的同时，也看到了古巴土地上长出绿色的嫩芽，象征着希望。

4.  **最终的预言：解放与新生**
    *   尽管存在巨大且迫在眉睫的威胁，但古巴最终将迎来解放。
    *   “绿色的嫩芽”预示着古巴将有一个充满生机和成长的新未来。

### **核心结论**

一句话总结：**古巴正秘密酝酿着一场由跨国犯罪集团和外部势力支持的、针对美国的生物武器攻击，但尽管危机四伏，古巴最终将获得解放并迎来新生。**

---

### **内容的总體框架**

此内容是一个典型的 **“预言性警告与希望启示”** 框架。它首先详细揭示了一个隐藏的、具体的、且迫在眉睫的威胁（警告），然后提供了一个关于最终救赎和积极未来的异象（希望），旨在警醒听众并给予他们对未来的信心。

Well, I'm going to go over some of the things the Lord has showed me concerning Cuba. And the storm coming out of Cuba. I've, I've warned about Cuba more than I warned about Venezuela. Cuba was a hotspot. Cuba is more serious than Venezuela. We went after Venezuela and we took Maduro out and that's all done. Right? No, it's not done. There's more to there's more coming. Their storm, the drug cartels, they don't want to let go. They don't, they've had a stronghold over that nation. This is big money. This isn't just a couple million dollars. It's billions of dollars of drug trafficking, human trafficking. They've had a stronghold on that nation. There's key leaders. There's key people through Cuba that are very dark and it goes into Claudia. And it's a three-stranded cord that is not easily broken. A three-stranded cord that goes through Mexico, to Claudia and the drug cartels to them into Cuba. It's like a V. So what the Lord has warned us so many times is as I saw the submarines and I saw both secretly delivering packages and things to Cuba in the night. Now, secret to us is secret to the United States of America. You being a hundred miles away from the southernmost point, I'm sure they know. I mean, they know, they know, they know what, you know, our blood type is, you know, they know everything about us basically, did pretend they don't signal it. But I've seen a storm coming out of Cuba and the Lord kept bringing up the 1960s, Cuban Missile Crisis. Revisiting old alliances with Russia and Cuba and the things that I've seen in the days that had secret things. And I saw underground caverns that were dug in Cuba with that were underground bases like in Cuba that had military stuff in it. Biological weapons that were delivered to them of how they could infiltrate, how they could, go after Miami, go after parts of the Keys, the Florida Keys, how do you attack and retaliate? And I saw the dragon come up three times out of the water that was lavender. If anybody remembers the dragon, it had purple under its eyes, it had purple and it was symbolic to something the Lord was trying to tell us about. But the dragon represented, it came up out of the water once, twice, three times. And it was dipping three times. It was symbolic of something would pray and over. But the Lord showed me a biological, the Lord said, the mules, watch for the mules. And I saw people moving at night in the cover of night that had a black drum, that had a symbol on the side, then a biological thing that looked like one of those bank teller tubes, which represented something else. And I saw a bank, it was like a bank teller, it was a cindler, a cindler, shit cindler, shit cindler, cindler, cindler, cindler, cindler, cindler, cindler, cindler, yep. And I saw a cylinder tube that was glass that had a symbol on the side of it. And the Lord showed me that coming out of Cuba, but it hit Miami side. It was coming on Miami side, not on Tampa, Miami. And this is the symbol I saw on the side of it. It was very serious. So we see these things and I saw liberation coming, but remember I saw a green blade coming up out of Cuba. Now adding to taking away from anything, but I saw a brand, a new future coming for him. I saw liberation coming for Cuba. I saw green coming up out of Cuba. It was a spring of growth.
