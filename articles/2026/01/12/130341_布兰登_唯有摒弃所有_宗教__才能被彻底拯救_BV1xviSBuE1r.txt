好的，这是根据您提供的文本所做的核心思想提炼与总结。

### **核心思想纲要**

1.  **上帝对“迷失者”的主动追寻：**
    *   核心比喻是“撇下九十九，寻找那一只羊”，强调上帝对每一个迷失灵魂的深切关怀。
    *   这不仅是针对群体，也包括具体的个人，如祷告中提到的“Tyrone”。

2.  **针对硬心者的拯救行动：**
    *   上帝的拯救目标特别指向那些内心刚硬、被其他信仰蒙蔽的人。
    *   明确提到了几个群体：穆斯林、佛教徒以及亚洲地区受这些信仰深刻影响的人。

3.  **为非信徒预备的“神迹”：**
    *   上帝将提供“神迹”（如即将出土的文物）来动摇非信徒（特别是穆斯林）的信仰根基。
    *   此举的目的不是为了验证《圣经》（因其自身即是真理），而是为了给那些“眼见为实”的硬心者一个相信的机会。

4.  **即将到来的全球灵魂大丰收：**
    *   预言了一场前所未有的、遍及全球（美、欧、亚、澳、非、南美）的灵魂大丰收。
    *   这股“荣耀的波浪”将冲击最刚硬的心，带来大规模的归信，但并非所有人都会得救。

5.  **耶稣再临的绝对紧迫性：**
    *   强烈反对任何长期预测（如“还有30年”），强调耶稣已“站在门口”，时刻都可能再临。
    *   这种紧迫感要求信徒保持警醒，并真实地传递信息，而非为了“表演”而说话。

### **核心要点**

上帝正以空前的紧迫感，主动追寻并感化包括穆斯林与佛教徒在内的硬心不信者，旨在耶稣再临前，掀起一场全球性的灵魂大丰收。

### **内容的总览框架**

这是一个基于**末世论的紧急布道框架**。它强调在耶稣即将再临的终末背景下，上帝正展开一场超自然的、全球性的灵魂拯救行动，其焦点是那些传统上被认为信仰坚固、内心刚硬的非基督教群体。整个信息的驱动力是神的爱与拯救的紧迫性。

He's coming after the hearts of her that are hardened toward him He's leaving the 99 to go after the one and when we were praying into I we even prayed for a Young man that was named was Tyrone Tyrone We call forth Tyrone to come home. I Saw an African woman American woman. There was an old woman praying for Tyrone and She was an elderly woman and she was in her rocking chair And she was interceding and we've been before the Lord for Tyrone God's heard all y'all's prayers He loves the souls Just as much as what you love your loved ones he loves his kids And he wished that none of us should perish but all come to repentance every single one of us He loves even the darkest of the darkest sinner and he doesn't want any of y'all to go to hell not one of them and That's why I was trying to say so much last night people try to misconstrue what I was saying It's not going to validate the Bible But it will shake the Muslims in the days ahead for that for the artifacts that will be found Out of the earth The Word of God validates itself it doesn't need any help But there's some people that will not believe unless they see a sign They're just that hard and The Lord said I'm going to provide a sign for the unbelievers brain in That's what he's saying and he's going after the Muslims that are just they're so strong in their faith of what they believe of being a Muslim Because they're blinded They're blinded by the unbelievers. They're blinded by false religion. They're by blinded like some Buddhists There's you they don't see and I saw going across Asia the hardness of the hardest hearts in Asia That were so bound by buddham being a Buddhist and Muslim or whatever That the Lord said I'm going after the Asians I'm going and I saw a wave of glory a wave of the prick of his presence upon the hardest of hearts bringing them in And I saw the greatest harvests of souls this world has ever seen before Will it be everybody no sadly Sadly, but he's leaving the 99 to go after the ones that were praying for So I want to pray for the people tonight I'm praying for a greatest harvest of souls in America and Europe and in Asia and in Australia in South America in Africa Why not believe for you know I hear one preach a billion so harvest and all this stuff then I hear one guy Well who I say we have 30 years left and all this other stuff listen Be careful who you're listening to we don't know 30 years Jesus is coming and he was to keep talking about having an urgency What's an urgency of 30 years? Urgency is he standing at the door and he tells me overbrain and I'm standing at the door To the ones that are truly hearing him and that are not cold or trying to perform if God's not speaking just shut up There's no reason to perform we're not here to entertain you
