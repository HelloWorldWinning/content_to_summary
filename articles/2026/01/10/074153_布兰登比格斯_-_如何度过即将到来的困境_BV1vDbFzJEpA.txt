Description:
好的，这是对所提供文本的分析、总结和概念图。

### **核心框架 (Overarching Framework)**

这是一个基于基督信仰的生活框架，其核心在于：通过**日常的属灵操练（根基）**和在**重大生命试炼（熬炼之火）**中持守**感恩与赞美**的态度，个人能够经历神的塑造、获得超自然的供应，并最终实现从一个层次到另一个更高层次的灵命进阶（从荣耀到荣耀）。

### **核心思想纲要 (Outline and Structure)**

1.  **灵命成长的双轨机制：根基与试炼**
    *   **日常根基是基础：** 每天的祷告、读经和在爱中行事，如同运动员的基本功，是赢得最终胜利的必要前提。
    *   **重大试炼是晋升的关键：** 生命中周期性（如每20年）的重大艰难困苦，即“熬炼之火”，是真正让你灵命层次提升的考验。这个过程如同陶匠塑造器皿或火炼净黄金，旨在去除杂质，塑造人的品格，使人成为更能被神使用的器皿。

2.  **应对未来艰难的核心策略：感恩与赞美**
    *   **预警与呼吁：** 演讲者作为“守望者”发出警告，未来将有远超“大萧条”的艰难时期，包括食物短缺和动荡。但这并非为了散播恐惧，而是呼吁人们预备和祷告。
    *   **感恩是开启祝福的钥匙：** 应对一切艰难的终极策略是培养一种持续感恩和赞美的生活方式。无论处境多么糟糕，总能找到可以感恩的事情（例如，能够呼吸、眼睛可以转动）。
    *   **赞美的力量：** 当赞美升起时，神的祝福就会降下。越多地赞美，祝福的流动就越丰盛，这是在即将到来的艰难中不至匮乏的秘诀。

3.  **信心生活的真实见证与应用**
    *   **奇迹般的供应：** 戴安娜（Diana）分享了她童年极度贫困时的亲身经历，例如：奇迹般地从汽水机获得饮料、门口凭空出现食物和圣诞礼物、陌生人主动为他们的车付油费等，证明了神在微小事物中的信实供应。
    *   **信心的实践与创意：** 夫妻二人在婚后极度贫困时，通过坚持祷告、凭信心奉献（播种在“好土”上），神赐予戴安娜在eBay上销售旧物的创意，这个想法最终发展成一门成功的生意，解决了他们的财务困境。这表明神会赐予人“创造财富的能力”。

### **核心结论 (Core Point)**

**培养一种凡事感恩、持续赞美的生活方式，是开启神的供应、经历奇迹并最终得胜一切生命试炼的根本秘诀。**

Hey, good morning family. How are y'all doing today? Well, I'm here again with my wife Diana Hi, and we're excited to be here. We have some things on our heart The Lord told me he said Brandon I want you to talk to my people again about the refiners fire and Where it where they are and what basically about how to get to the next level a lot of people they think well, it's the praying and The reading my Bible that gets me to the next level That is the fundamentals. Okay. We use the fundamentals at the day-to-day It's like it's just I want to say it like this an athlete a professional athlete does the fundamentals That gets him to be in a champion at the at the game at the major game the world series But without the fundamentals they'll never become a champion at the end game Okay, it's the fundamentals the day-to-day the day-to-day today that gets you to be a champion and That's what you know, it's the major test in life. It's the refiners fire That gets us to the next level from going from glory to glory to glory to glory But if you don't do the ABCs one two three's you'll never get to the past the test and a lot of times I thought this one time I was going through a really hard time and and I thought where is the Lord? I felt like everything was stripped away I was going through a a valley and it was dark and I cried myself to sleep many many nights and not knowing that I was being tested and It was the refining fire. He is the the the the Potter We are the clay and we have this treasure and earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power will be known of him and not of us We you need to understand it's it's it's him and us I'm just a person just like you are But he will use you in the kingdom if you yield yourself to him, but you have to be a vessel that's been tried You will not walk in the greater glory and the manifest demonstrations and manifestations without being on the potter's will it? takes It's like Lynn Hammond had a visitation She was talking about it one time and she had a manifestation of Jesus and he gave her a song that Make me better make me pure by the fire that does refine Where the breath of God is sweeter there his brightest glory shines Lift me high up to the mountain into fellowship with thee and in that light I'll see the fountain of the blood which cleanses me And it was it was a it came right out of from Jesus to to her singing to her But she was going through a refining fire and I'm trying to tell you all the fundamentals of life We have those test times and the Lord showed me a lot of people will be tested usually every 20 years He showed me it was it was keys and he showed me the life life divided up in quarters And he showed he gave me this whole thing. It was beautiful About how he tests us and we go from glory to glory, but the the Monday through Fridays Saturday Sunday we we we are we are growing each and every single day And then when we get to those major tests, we don't even know a lot times like he told me see I test you all the time And that's and that's what shapes us into the character being on that potters will of that pushing on our flesh pushing on our flesh making us Molding and and and putting us through the fire and it's like a refining us It's like gold pulling out all of the impurities and the more you you you work it And you pull out those impurities the pure of the gold gets okay So here we are as vessels that are on the potters will God is molding and making us into great beautiful pieces of art for him and In the more we realize it's not about us. It's about him working in us The more he will be able to trust you that you realize that I'm I he he is that he is the everything I Am I'm a vessel? Chosen by God we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power will be known of him and not of us And so when we realize that the more God is going to use you and mold Mold you and you keep going from glory to glory in that greater outpouring, but he showed me he said Cuz I cuz I was asking him about things. I said Lord show me how are we going to get? to this greater manifestations of what you showed me of the great glory of Healings and demonstrations and he said Brandon it's going to come through the fundamentals It's going to come through walking in love. You've got to get down the foundation of love better The comment section is as a test for me a lot of times You know dealing with people my son had told me things what's being said and in my wife And so we have to we have we're growing all together. This has been this has been a major major change of events for us like getting on there and taking down all of these False accounts saying they're me Call them prophetic bigs and all these things. I don't call myself a prophet. I'm a watchman I'm just like you all I pray and I tell you what I hear and what I see. I don't claim to be a prophet I don't claim to be anything I just want to tell you the Lord said come on YouTube and tell you tell you all that that he's coming and So, you know, I don't need a title I don't need all that all I need is you to hear that what I've done What I'm doing is telling you what he's told me to tell you and whether you receive that an eye It's on you But it you know, but it's like coming on there and dealing with the people like this last couple of days Diana Diana spent literally 24 hours. She was up all night long and all day Taking those accounts down after we saw that they were using my platform what the Lord's giving me to Celeste that you all for orphanage that I don't even real Yeah, fake orphanages I don't know they were asking for all for money and I don't who knows what they were pretending it was for crypto Yeah for crypto they had fake they said it fake everything and they were asking for donations Yeah, under you're trying to pretend to be you and messaging people and Saying what message me on what's that? It was it was I'm really tired today Yeah, it was rough It's seeing all that and some of this people had 30,000 subscribers some of them had 10,000 some about It was a lot of people and they had some videos had 1.1 million views More than I've had on my YouTube channel what golf to the glory of God for those people hopefully they got reached but they're using that to Get money for people, you know, it's like it's it's very very personal to me because we have a child special needs It's overcoming to use children with special needs to try to solicit people for money And I'm telling you I'm never asking anybody for a dime never The Lord said freely you've been given freely you give out He said if you feed my people Brandon, they will take care of you Never ask for anything Always come and just give it and I and I and I've done the best I can to tell you exactly what the Lord is Telling me to warn you about the storms that are coming a great shaking is coming Food shortages are coming I Would say basically there birthing pains like you you can't imagine the Lord had me even like what like even Yesterday praying over American Airlines praying over the United Airlines. I don't know what I just got it I saw planes flying in this guy major planes flying in this guy enough. I well this is very interesting I don't know what this is all about but I get pieces and also pray over the airlines Well, I don't know why is it seriously? I don't know But I just know the sick pray over the airlines So I get this piece and then you'll start warning me about power outges and you know, start warning me about food shortages and things like that and And basically, you know, you could go down the fear tactic of all you know all the stuff that you see and you know People get into all the fear and you know, they say hey you're gonna make a viral video talk about fear boy They sure like it. I mean, I told we laugh about it my son did because it's like what why don't y'all want to hear about the glory more Than what you want to hear about fear? We got you got to shake that off God is a good God and he's a faithful God and he's an anointed God and and He wants us to live and exceedingly abundantly above all that we'd ask your thing But I'm trying to tell you all it's time to walk in victory about some things It's time to lay your hands on the sick and see him recover for us to be the light and the salt and And and and stop walking in fear. We don't need to be walking in fear I tell you these things not to walk in fear, but a call to prayer to say hey listen This is this is sounding alarm sounding alarm look at all these things that are coming But they seem to be people are more into that than they are to tell you hey There's a glory coming, you know in prayer at church tonight we were hearing about brother Hagen during the 1920s and Some of the some of the the greats that I believe you know change my life Just by hearing some of the stories that they did and pastor Chip was talking about he said that They would pray by by just giving God praise during the great tribulation They would give God it's not the great tribulation. Yeah folks. Sorry During the during the great depression not the tribulation the great depression But they would pray and they never did without food They never went without food one time because they praise they learn how to cultivate praise in their household And when praises go up blessings come down. Okay, so I want to teach you all that You've got to get into our atmosphere of thanksgiving and praise being thankful For what the Lord has already provided in your life You may not feel like he's done anything in your life You may look in and go wild look at me. I don't have nothing I'm bores jones turkey But you can be thankful for something You start with that one thing and you get you get all up in and be thankful all day long God I am able to breathe. I'm able to breathe. I took a breath out of my lungs today My eyes if you may be paralyzed, I'm eyes moving I can move my eyes And you may not be able to move anything else, but you can move your eyes Be thankful for any little thing that you and I'm telling you That's the the key of the open door for the greater blessings being thankful. I I'm talking to myself There's so much that I feel the Lord has done for us in the last two three months And I and I take time and I complain about certain things and the Lord's that Brandon Are you are you can't you be grateful about one thing? And I have to he's he'll correct me. Oh Lord, I'm sorry Forgive me you've given so much to me. I have for who to my belly. I have a rough over my head I have my bills are paid. You've got you you can you can give God praise for something And when you do blessings flow The more you praise them the more blessings will flow and I'm telling you whenever I heard pester chip talk about The great depression And he was saying that brother hagan and them never went without food Because they always praised him for the little things and for what I've seen coming I'm talking you think they're the great depression with bad in those storybooks For what I have seen coming folks. This is going to make the great depression look like a walk in the park Because this generation doesn't understand how to even grow things in a garden They don't know how to go and do most things. They're they're so used to going through mcdonalds and getting their you know A little happy meal or whatever This is a different generation than it was a hundred years ago So that's what i'm talking about. You've got to learn now You've got to learn now how to live by faith now So that you're able to operate when things get rough. You can't wait until things get rough And to and then start doing the things and go well, I'm we're going to start practicing it now Practice his presence today Practice him today And so you know tell him about that time whenever you know you had grocery show up as a little girl Yeah, um as a child We grew up really really poor We lived in a car for a while. Um, my parents didn't take You know help from the government or anything. So We lived in a car for a while. We ate ketchup packets For food those free ketchup packets that you get out of the McDonald's we ate that we lived in the car Um for how long though? Oh for probably I would say at least a year Yeah, I remember I was really little. I was probably like four or five Um, maybe a little younger homeless. Yeah, and um, I remember Uh one time we were in the car me and my older sister We were sitting in the car and it was in a hot summer day and we were so so hot And uh, we saw this soda machine in front of us We were in the car and the soda machine was right there and I remember my I remember being so thirsty That I got out of the car. We got out of the car. I said, I said sister. Let's go over there We let let's see about that if we can find a quarter on the ground and maybe we can get a soda out of there So we got out of the car and just walked right up to that machine And I remember uh, there was no quarters But I pushed a button and a soda came out of it and my sister and I got so excited It's imprinted in my brain forever. I was we rejoiced about that She pushed a button and another one came out and then I pushed another one and another one came out And we loaded our arms full of sodas and they were cold It was the best it was the best thing ever. So see god knows The desires of heart and he he in your needs and and I I It felt like a very a very spiritual day that day. We were so Like it was a hundred and very hot And we just rejoiced his little kids. We were out there rejoicing and going and we got enough for Several coaks for each of us and we then we stopped and then we were like Let's just go back to the to the car and drink them and it was the best day It was the most refreshing soda I've ever had in my life And it's it was you know those god moments and we just rejoiced at that at the little small things when we We didn't have enough money to pay our electric bills as kids and they were always turned off a lot of times and we We didn't have food in our fridge And we would have we would pray and we would have groceries or groceries show up on our doorstep I countless times. I we just I just remember so many small things that the small maripals and as being Just rejoicing and being so excited about everything and It was just a lifestyle, you know, even as a kid We just got so excited about everything that the war did I mean bigger small and you know Business presence first most presence one time. Yeah, we We had christmas present show somebody came and just showed up in the middle of the night We were like sleeping on the floor somewhere I vaguely remember as a kick as I was so little and I remember them showing up with with christmas presence and Beautifully wrapped just beautiful and I remember it was one of the best christmas I ever had and it wasn't even necessarily a whole Whole lot of them. It was just We didn't have anything and so you were just we were just so thankful and appreciative Uh countless little things like that. I can't remember and even like and even like going in the in the in the line We would be sitting at Uh, you know a gas station and my my dad would run out of gas All the time we were driving the car because we didn't have any money for anything And I remember barely making it to a gas station one time and then someone just would pay for our gas And they would say you know what I feel like I'm supposed to pay for your gas today Miracle after miracle and you know, it doesn't have to be a big miracle to be a miracle It's that god is in everything. He's in the small things. He's in the big things and you know We were just being thankful for everything It's beautiful. I love it. There's so many times, you know, even we've we've been married That we didn't have nothing and we we were we were trying to just figure out how to pay our electric bill And dino I told her I said we don't have enough money this month to pay our electric bill because it was summer and our electric was higher And when you're working for a church we work for a church and I we made we made barely nothing It was it was rough living on food stamps, you know I was a janitor there for a long time and we we struggled and There was times whenever we got we get paid every two weeks and we would have it all spent before we got it By borrowing on a credit card or whatever we could do to just make it Yeah, our bills took up our entire paycheck So it would be already spent weary. Oh, well that goes to trying to get therapy for Megan Trying to get her speech or whatever, you know, the government would only cover so much and and uh because it was expensive And uh, we thought well, what are we gonna do? And so we we were so desperate to try to help Megan Um at that time just trying to just find any kind of alternative uh to to help her to function more because we just we wanted her to live a normal life and um It was rough We charged everything up. We were Tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt and back then whenever you're making what we made It it looked like a mountain. So we you know you had to file bankruptcy you'd do everything you can To just get through because we didn't have food There would be times where we loved man. What are we gonna do? And so, you know, there's always grandma she'd make you a mill or buy your pizza or surprise you Things that god would put on her heart and she didn't even know, you know, we wouldn't we we've never been a people to uh give a ministry of hints Or or hey, we're having a hard time because we we believe by faith We're not going to go around talking about our problems to everybody and telling them how bad you've got it Because it's just like it's just like this I try to tell y'all praying in the spirit and not letting the devil see that he's that he's made a move on you that's working That you feel like it's beating you down Keeping your head above and giving god praise for every little thing So I just sit on the couch just like i'm doing right now And and my son can testify to this because he'd get in there with us and die in and we God I just want to say thank you that our water bill is paid tonight And I would spend my whole I spent my whole entire night Giving god praise for the water bill God, I thank you for the water bill. Anyway, not only a hundred dollar water bill or in trash, whatever It's not very much but it was a lot to us And we would take a seed And we would sow what we could And we didn't have a seed because bible says giving it shall be given under you good measure Press down shaking together and running over will it give under your business and it was required for us to tithe our tithe staff And we're at the tithe we didn't want to tithe because we were like we don't have enough money to Be early but but it was required to tithe So we would believe by faith To to to get through at the next to the next week after you tithe you think man You know even if it was two 200 bucks for tithe because we didn't make much You think this is a lot because it would have paid electric or maybe something, you know, but but I but I trust it God And I would ask the lord god show me and give me a creative idea to get wealth And that's where I always ask him father. You're gonna you're gonna take care of us and he would always provide He we always got through I was so a seed And he would I would use my faith I was so a seed and it would provide for that need He always take care of us and we got to the point We started sowing a little bit more a little bit more and and I will I realize That the lord started teaching me about good ground Because not all ground is going to produce Most people don't want to hear that and a lot of people go well, that's not no no no Some 30 some 60 and some 100 fold and I'd always ask the lord show me where miracle good soil ground is Show Diana and I where Amazing ground is because god I need a quick harvest like miracle grow. I need this seed to produce fast I don't need it to be in the ground for weeks at a time and us receive six months a year from now I need it tomorrow. I need a miracle tomorrow And so I started just praying and asking him and ask it's showing father. It's praying the spirit show me the father I think you go you show me good ground So I would take five dollars and I would believe by faith for that five dollars to produce for my family I saw a dollar so two dollars whatever I had I put an offering envelope. Whatever god tell me show me the good ground I tested the ground I tested the ground I tested the ground and I would make sure and if it and if it didn't produce real quick We didn't give there again, but I would if I start a quick saw quick return I'll go that's good ground babe. Let's do that again So we would so intentionally and believe god for harvest And say lord show us what to do because we need a blessing because I but I trusted god With all my heart all my soul and all my mind all my strength And I lean not on to my understanding But in all that ways acknowledge him and he say he direct your path And that's what we did over and again over and again and they're telling me we didn't have enough money. We got us a jeep We were so sick because we drove along ways to because we had a cheap little warehouse shotgun warehouse. It was bad It was bad. It was bad. I looked back and I go lord. It was it was rough Snakes come up through the floor rotten mold got cockroaches. It was it was awful We lived there for a long long time And god provided and it was to the point where my son wake up in the middle of the middle of the night There'd be a massive black snake by his feet Wasn't yeah, it'd be a big old thick black snake curled up by his feet coming up through the baseboards because our our floor was so bad And we had we had mice we had cockroaches It was it was your why to put traps out all the time clean up things to the neighbors next door or a crack house And they had meth they were cooking meth so bad we couldn't open our windows up in the fall because they were cooking meth And the meth blow into our house and it smells so bad and make you say it So you had to keep your window shut because you couldn't keep though And so one night was praying to loris to deal with this and all of a sudden a massive explosion happened from the meth house And and I don't know if they're heard or anything I don't know but I they stopped cooking meth after that because the massive explosion took place next door And god took care of that real quick Bless their hearts. They need jesus, but uh And then and then one night we had these uh cocaine dealers there were two doors down from there and um We have a drug rate had a massive drug raid in the middle of the night and had all the FBI of them We had it looked like christmas out there all the lights going and I thought oh, I said my my wife come up There's front door. She's a remember you said oh my god. She was what's going on out there I said, I don't know shut the door quick because they were running across our front front Are front line with all their guns and everything running and raiding these dudes with all their cocaine and drugs Man, it was bad, but but god is faithful. It's not about the path. I'm just telling where we come from We were praying for them to get saved. Yeah, it was But they weren't a jail for their salvation They did they needed help They're showing out on drugs man. They went they they were big drug dealers But math on one side crack on the other, you know, but got but got took care of us and we live there for a long time 20 years 20 years we lived that faith for 20 years But god suddenly provided It took us so in seed and believing god so in seed and believing god, but god provided I'm trying to tell you all it may not happen overnight But if you keep on keeping on and you keep But if you keep on keeping on and you don't let go and you stand when they're all served God When you stand in there when you want all there else to do is stand stand there for God is a faithful god He started giving Diana the idea didn't he? Yeah about selling on ebay. Yep Yep, he whole egoist idea Tony Yeah, so one of those times whenever we didn't have enough money to make our bills for the month electric Yeah, it was electric and we were going over our budget and We he said we have I just got laid off for the church because our pastor fell morally. Yeah And so he said we this is what we have we have a hundred dollars to last us for the next two weeks and I I didn't know what to do So I took it to god in prayer and I was I was saying god We need that we need to stretch this I need ideas for how we can do this And that's whenever he gave me the idea for selling on ebay So I said let's take that in that hundred dollars and let's go to a thrift store and we'll buy Something and you know as clothing or whatever and I I think I can we the Lord's gonna bless it And we will he actually if he gave me this idea, what do you think and he said? Yeah, let's do it So we went and he uh said in the car with the kids and I went in there and I was just going I had no idea what I was doing never had I was I was a downer at that time. I told you I said this is never going to work I said, what are you doing? This is our last hundred dollars. He said I said but I said if you feel the Lord told you the Lord let's let's support you But he was like I don't I just I don't know how you're gonna do that. So I went in there And I had looked up online and researched what I thought what would and you know based on what ebay The cells and what I thought would maybe the Lord was leading me to try to find so I went in there And I just went down every hour and I was praying in the spirit I remember that was praying in the spirit praying in tongues and I was like Lord I need your helpful I need you to guide me to to find what we do so we can stretch it and so I just went and I went through everything It took I probably was in there for probably it was about four hours I was in the car with Megan and I remember thinking I think she never coming out It was rough Megan was really overcoming then yeah, I said I need your help Lord I have no idea what I'm doing But I really feel you waiting you're you're leading me to do this and so I went through and I went through every Everything and I okay, I think I think I feel like the hoisbridge told me to do that I had no clue what I was doing just praying in the spirit the whole time and filled my buggy up with you know trying to find things and went went took it loaded it in the car and showed Brandon and he was like okay, well, let's let's see how it goes and I got a sheet out laid all the clothes laid each one on it and took care of them took both my phone just took my phone Took pictures of it and then just started an eBay account And I think I had I already had one because I had used it just to buy kids clothes My kids closed from there before and I just put it on there and loaded it up and did auctions and within a week It was like it's seven-day auctions and within a week we had enough to pay our election bill Yeah, enough to pay our lecture bill and have more a little extra yeah, and I said let's do it again I said baby. I'm sorry. I I'm sorry. I said you were right. I was wrong and it was it And we did it and within within between May and September we had made more than what we had made working from the church Just just able from from able to support our income Because I got laid off And was it told don't you know that we're not gonna be able to use you anymore because the finance is drag up the church after the patch They'll morally they cut back on staff. So yeah, and so I was like well, it's all right. God made away So then Yep, and so then it just flourished from there and I just kept doing it and then I eventually was able to quit my job there at the church Yeah, so it was it was and I was able to Home school because we needed we needed help doing we had a lot of things going on with Megan and everything else So it worked out But what but it didn't take it didn't happen overnight It happened as you stand And as you so and you believe and God took what we thought was an impossible situation Into something that was all things are possible to him that believe It took a bulldog faith latched on and saying I will not give up and I will trust God And and and it was her God used her it wasn't me And then I started praying and I started praying the spirit with her I was like I'm gonna join up with her instead of being seen against him being being What's don't be divided? Let's be let's be together So I started praying the spirit and the Lord started showing me things in the spirit and said I'd see clothes or garments or whatever and I'd say Diana There's because he'd get used to my prophetic gift and in seeing and I would see what was coming I say let's listen babe at this thrift store at this place there is an armani Jacket in there go find that and the Lord said that I pay for the rent Yeah And so she would go is it and she'd come into the window and because I'd sit out in the car with Megan And uh she'd pull it up and show it in the window said Like that you like it's there babe look it's right and I'd be like Good job. So we would get in she'd buy and list it and and and and then the lumbo of the Lord did exactly What do you say you do? I'll provide for this and we did that and we've done it and we've done it and we still do it And so um you build relationships and you start growing your business and and the Lord blessed our ebay and our posh mark and Yep And and we've been doing it now for 11 12 years Long time And so it it's been it's been fruitful But God's been faithful and like I said it took time and Lord gives you ideas and he gives you the power to get well And that's why I told you what are you good at? It may not be ebay. It may not be computers. You may be amazing at making uh some kind of tops that spend for kids or some kind of cakes or I had one lady say that God gave her an idea to make lemonade And blessed it We got a testimony about a woman saying she may eliminate and God's blessing she's gonna have a vending vending trucks and all kinds of Creative idea to get wealth But he'll speak to you and show you how to do it because God is a god of blessing And he giving him praise for it and being thankful for it. Yep I remember whenever I listed it, we would I would get a bid Like nine nights since and I said thank you god. Thank you For 99 cents You rejoiced it the little thing and then it wouldn't grow more. I said I get up every morning and check it I'd say praise god look what the bid is look what it is today and you just rejoice at that But it's easy, but it's easy. This is where it becomes when you start seeing a flow a flow of finances Or you start taking it for granted never get comfortable with not giving god praise Never get comfortable without saying thank you for what he has done Because it's easy to take it for granted. It's easy to look at it and say oh, it's not a big good anymore To expect it. Oh, it's just gonna happen. No No, god is in everything. Every good thing comes from god.
