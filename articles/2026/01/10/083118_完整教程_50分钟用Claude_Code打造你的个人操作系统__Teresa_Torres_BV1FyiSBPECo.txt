Description:
好的，这是根据您提供的文本内容提炼和总结的核心思想。

### **核心思想摘要**

#### **1. 核心理念：将 Claude Code 视为全能的“结对工作伙伴”**
Teresa 的核心理念是将 Claude Code 的应用从纯粹的编码辅助，扩展到工作和生活的方方面面，包括写作、研究、任务管理和战略思考。她不把 Claude 当作一个简单的工具，而是视为一个需要被“教导”和“训练”的智能伙伴，通过持续的互动和上下文构建，使其深度融入个人工作流。

#### **2. 基础工作流设置**
*   **工具组合:**
    *   **Obsidian:** 作为基于 Markdown 的中央笔记和知识库，存放所有任务、笔记、文章草稿和上下文文件。
    *   **终端 (Terminal):** 主要交互界面，通过命令行与 Claude Code 高效沟通，通常会为不同项目（如任务管理、写作）开启独立的终端窗口。
*   **项目化管理:**
    *   为不同的工作领域（如 `Tasks`, `Writing`）创建独立的文件夹，每个文件夹都配置了专属的 `claude.md` 文件，使其成为一个独立的 "Claude 项目"，拥有不同的规则和背景知识。

#### **3. 核心工作流实践**
*   **A. 自动化任务管理系统:**
    *   **每日启动:** 每天早上在 `Tasks` 文件夹的终端中输入 `today` 命令。
    *   **自动执行:** 该命令会触发一个脚本，自动检查 Trello、扫描 Obsidian 中的任务文件（按截止日期和状态），并生成一个名为 `today.md` 的当日任务清单。
    *   **动态研究:** 脚本还会自动搜索学术预印本网站和谷歌学术，将相关的新研究摘要添加到当日任务清单中。
    *   **快速创建:** 可以随时在终端通过自然语言（如 `new task [任务内容] due today`）快速创建新任务，Claude 会自动生成对应的 Markdown 文件并存入系统。
*   **B. “结对编程”式写作流程:**
    *   **角色定位:** 将 Claude 定位为研究员、编辑和思维“陪练”，而不是代笔。Teresa 坚持自己完成主要写作，以保留个人声音和深化思考。
    *   **迭代式合作:**
        1.  **构思与大纲:** 与 Claude 来回讨论，探索不同的文章结构和切入点。
        2.  **研究辅助:** 让 Claude 进行网络搜索、关键词研究和学术文献查证，为写作提供素材和依据。
        3.  **分段反馈:** 每写完一个章节，就让 Claude 提供反馈，包括内容优点、改进建议、技术准确性审查和错别字修正。
    *   **效率提升:** 这种紧密的合作模式极大地提升了写作效率和深度，例如，她用一天半就完成了一篇 9000 字的深度长文。

#### **4. 系统的大脑：三层上下文（Context）管理框架**
这是整个系统的关键，它为 Claude 提供了稳定且分层的“记忆”。
*   **第一层：全局 `claude.md` 文件:**
    *   **位置:** 位于用户主目录（`~/.claude/claude.md`）。
    *   **内容:** 存放适用于所有项目的通用偏好和工作原则（例如“在行动前先规划”）。内容必须极其精简，因为它会在每次会话中被加载。
    *   **关键作用:** 包含一个**上下文文件索引**，告诉 Claude 在遇到特定主题（如“我的业务”、“我的团队”）时应该去哪里查找更详细的上下文文件。
*   **第二层：项目 `claude.md` 文件:**
    *   **位置:** 位于具体的项目文件夹内（如 `Tasks/claude.md`）。
    *   **内容:** 定义该特定项目的工作规则和流程。例如，`Tasks` 文件夹的 `claude.md` 知道如何处理任务、标签和 Trello 集成；`Writing` 文件夹的 `claude.md` 则知道她的写作风格指南。
*   **第三层：模块化上下文文件库 (`LLM_context` 文件夹):**
    *   **内容:** 大量细分的、独立的 Markdown 文件，详细描述了关于她个人、业务、产品、团队、营销渠道等各方面的信息。
    *   **调用方式:** 这些文件不会默认加载，只有当查询触发了全局 `claude.md` 中定义的索引规则时，Claude 才会按需读取相关文件。这确保了上下文窗口的清洁和高效。

#### **5. 上下文的持续构建与维护**
*   **迭代式构建:** 上下文文件是逐步建立的。核心原则是：“**当你发现自己需要向 Claude 重复解释某个背景信息时，就停下来，把它变成一个上下文文件。**”
*   **让 Claude 自我维护:**
    *   **会话后提问:** 在每次重要的会话结束时，问 Claude：“你从这次合作中学到了什么？我们应该把哪些新信息添加到上下文文件中？”
    *   **“采访我”模式:** 可以直接让 Claude “采访我关于我的业务”，通过问答形式自动生成结构化的上下文文件。

### **核心结论**
通过将 Claude Code 深度集成到日常工作流中，并为其精心构建一个分层的、可迭代的上下文记忆系统，可以将其从一个简单的工具转变为一个强大的、全方位的个人工作伙伴，从而极大地提升工作效率和产出深度。

### **总体框架**
该内容的核心框架是**“像管理人一样管理 AI”**。它将 Claude Code 视为一个需要明确指令（项目 `claude.md`）、背景知识（上下文文件库）和通用工作原则（全局 `claude.md`）的智能助理。通过建立一套标准操作流程（SOPs），并持续为其提供和更新“记忆”，从而实现高效的人机协作，最终将 AI 的能力发挥到极致，使其成为思考和执行的放大器。

At the beginning of my day, I literally just write today, and we can see what it does. It generates my to-do list for today. It's gonna go to Trello and see if anybody on my team has added any new Trello cards. And then it basically runs this Python script. And then you can see it's gonna read my to-day MD, and it's gonna update it, and you can see it popped up here. So this is a link to my research digest, my blog post. It's 9,000 words, and I wrote it in one and a half days. There is no way I would have done this myself. That is insane to me. Yes, I'm thinking about it. What do you think? Oh, I don't really like that. What if we try this other way? And then I do that throughout the whole construction of the blog post. It can just be like, interview me about my business, and then it will ask you a bunch of questions, and then it will write a context file for you. This file we're looking at, this profile, I never wrote a word of it. Every time I have Claude add a context file, I say what index needs to be updated, and it just figures it out. And I see I'm just overwhelmed by all this stuff. What are your three tips to get started? Whenever you find yourself explaining context to Claude, stop and think about, am I ever going to have to explain this context to Claude again? Okay, welcome everyone. My guest today is Teresa Tores. Teresa is a legend in the PM field. She's author of continuous discovery habits. But today we're going to talk about how Teresa uses Cloud Code for everything from writing to editing to task management to coding. Really excited to get her to give us a tour of her Cloud Code projects, and show us how it's actually done. So welcome Teresa. Thanks for having me. I'm excited to do this. Yeah. So I've also used Cloud Code quite a bit, but I'm super interested in seeing your high-level workflows. Maybe you can give us a quick tour first. Yeah, let me share my screen. Okay, so what we're looking at is really simple. I have Obsidian here on the left, and if people aren't familiar with Obsidian, it's just a note-taking tool that's based on Markdown. And then I have two terminal windows on the right. And the big thing that I use Claude Code for, like I started using it coding, just like everybody else that's most people's entry into it. But what I really loved about Claude Code with coding is it's almost like you're pair programming with Claude. And I was like, wow, how do I pair with Claude on everything that I do? And so I started doing this for writing and for strategy and for literally all of the work that I do. This is my setup. This is my work Obsidian Vault. So I have an Obsidian Vault called Work. In it, there's a bunch of sub-directories. One of them is LLM context, which I'll get into that. And then my notes, which is just any notes that I have. I have a research project that we can talk through. I have my task system, worthy reads are like articles that I've saved. The other people wrote that I really like, and then my writing directory. And then you can see I have a Claude MD file here. And we can kind of go through all of this. But I'm going to start with tasks. So the way my task system works is I have folders for different things. So I have a folder for bugs. I have a folder for ideas. I have a folder for tasks. And every day I launch Claude inside my tasks folder. So you can see this top terminal window. I'm in tasks. I'm just going to launch Claude. And at the beginning of my day, I literally just write today. And we can see what it does. The first thing it's going to do is it's going to go to Trello and see if anybody on my team has added any new Trello cards to my board. You can see good news. There's no new Trello cards. I've already run this today, but we'll just see what it looks like. And then it basically runs this Python script where it generates my to-do list for today. So that's what we're looking at here in obsidian. It says Monday November 10th. I have one overdue item. I have a number of items that are due today. And then I have my in progress ideas that I'm working on. And this script just generated this file. Every task is a markdown file. So you can see in my tasks folder, I just have a whole bunch of tasks. Basically, this task that's overdue is due on Friday. You can see it's just I have to call the grooming place for my dog and schedule an appointment for her. And I didn't do that yet. And then all my other tasks, like I have calls with a couple people today. I'm writing a Claude at code safety article. I've got to add some images to it. All this stuff just shows up on my to-do list every day based on what I put in my tasks. Got it. So the other tasks, like the calls and stuff, is coming from a calendar or is it coming from just your notes? It's tasks that I've created. And I'll show you, we're going to create a new task together. I'll show you what that looks like. So that's the first thing is when I run the Timit Day command, I do it every morning. It's basically looking through my tasks folder and looking for anything that's due today or anything that's overdue. And then it creates this today file for me. And it's just telling me what do I need to do today. And then I distinguish between tasks that have a due date and ideas that they're more like projects that don't have a specific due date, but they're things that I have going that are ongoing. So you can see I have a podcast just now possible. That's always in my in progress because it's reminding me to make sure I schedule guests. And you can see here I have a single episode. This is my project for getting that episode ready to be released. And then I have a task for social media. But this is really just my like remember to schedule guests kind of thing that's always in progress. And so what this does is it gives me a lot of flexibility. If I just have a random idea, I can just say it a cloud, new idea, and it will tell it what it is. It will create a markdown file. It'll put it in my ideas folder. If it's a task, I can give it a due date. And then it will show up on my on this like to do list. This is just called my today MD. On the day that it's due. Should we try making maybe like record pockets of Peter or something like some sort of task? Yeah. So we'll do a new task in just a second here. The other thing that's happening when I run this today command. It is I've built this research system. So I'm trying to keep up to date on like academic research that's related to my work. And so I built this system that searches a preprint server and then Google scholar every day. And it gives me a research report of what's relevant to my work. And that gets added to this today list. So you can see right here, it's not here yet. And it's because we haven't done that part. So it's running this slash command that's part of my research project. And now it's asking me, oh, it wants to go see if there's a research queue. So we're going to say yes to that. And then you'll see it's going to update this today list with any research for me to review. It's creating my research today. Got it. So this is just like searching some websites to find new research, right? Yeah. And then you can see it's going to read my today. And it's going to update it. And you can see it popped up here. So this is a link to my research digest. So that's my today command. And you can see it gives me a summary. Like this is what I just did. I created your today MD with the overdue task 10 in tasks for in progress, your research, whatever. And then you can see it's also creating a this week view and a next week view. Got it. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So let's say I want to do a new task. We're actually going to write a blog post together. So I'm going to do new task. Write plan auto, accept, clod, blog post, do today draft. Outline with cloud. And basically this, this task folder is set up with a cloud MD. So that cloud knows what to do with this. It knows to create a task. You can see it's using obsidian front matter. And I've defined this whole system for cloud. So it knows to do this. It's defining as a task. It's putting the due date as today. It's tagging it for me. It's give basically giving me kind of a checklist. I'm actually not supposed to do this because it's kind of a crummy checklist. It's supposed to just take my notes, but pretty good. We're going to go with that. And then let's see if sometimes cloud is smart enough to put something due to day on my today MD. It's not this time. So I'm going to say add to today MD. Got it. Okay. And then what that's going to do is it's just going to add that task. You can see it's here. So now I have my write plan, auto, accept mode. What I love about this is I work out of the terminal most of the day. And I keep this task terminal open all the time. So if like I think of something that I have to do or I have a random idea, I literally can just be like new idea, blah, blah, blah. And it's done. And then I can just go back to my work in my other window. And it's a lot faster than like opening a web browser, going to Trello, creating a new card, setting a due date. Right? It's just it's super fast. And that's what I love about it. Got it. This episode is brought to you by Optimizely. The family in marketing usually isn't a lack of ideas. It's a lack of time. If your two new list keeps getting away from you, then take a look at Optimizely OPPO, an AI agent platform built visually for marketing. With OPPO, you can use AI agents for SEO and geo recommendations, A.B. testing, website analysis, and much more. OPPO knows your brand inside and out and plugs into your existing tools and data systems so that you can save time on labor intensive feature testing, reporting, and more. See what it can take off your plate at Optimizely.com slash AI. Now back to our episode. The other thing I'll share is it allows me to do things like, what are all my marketing ideas? And it's just going to go search my ideas folder for anything related to marketing. And so like whenever I'm working on a new project, I can just ask Claude, like, what are my tasks related to this? Or what are my open ideas that are related to this? And it just goes out and finds them. And like Trello has searched, but it's not the best, for include. Okay. So I like this a lot too. So you have like ideas and memories and like, random re-reacherous snippets that you pull. Yeah, so you can see, like in my tax folder, I have bugs that have been filed, I have ideas. Import is for if I'm importing a bunch of stuff from Trello, I want to review it to make sure it imported correctly. My inbox is how I get stuff from my phone to my, to this whole system. Memories is like things, it's like little snippets that I want to remember. So we can kind of look at what's in here. I think this is safe. Like I have an affiliate link to the AI e-vels course that I always forget what it is. So it's literally just here's my affiliate link. This is a task. I don't know actually know about some memories. Real real real real quick. What do you mean by inbox? Like how you send an email to yourself over the phone or how it has. Yeah. So this, this is a little bit of a hack and I'm actually moving away from it. So I mentioned that I moved a bunch of stuff and it broke some things. But I was using Dropbox to sync my vaults. And I'm now moving to obsidian sync to sync my vaults. So the obsidian sync, I can use the iOS obsidian app and I can just access all of this stuff from my phone. But when I was using Dropbox, I had to set up, this is like a iCloud linked folder. So I could add to it from my phone and then it would automatically show up here. And then I could pull it into my task system. That was kind of a pain in the butt. So I moved from Dropbox to obsidian sync to make that easier. Got it. Okay. So basically obsidian and cloud code run into life right now. Yeah. Pretty much cloud code in obsidian read my life. All right. So let's go back to the writing the blog post has. So like, how's it going to help us write this blog post? Yeah. So I could do this. Let's do this. We're going to get rid of this dumb checklist that cloud made because I don't like it. And we're just going to do like, okay, I'm going to talk through. I'm just going to like talk out loud when I plan out my blog post. So for context, I'm in the middle of writing this huge cloud code series for people that are non-technical. And it started with like, what is cloud code? Why is it different from cloud in the browser? And then the second post in the series was about like how to give cloud a memory, which if you want to get into that, all my context files are also here in obsidian. And then the third blog post that's coming out this Wednesday is about safety. So how to use cloud code safely. And then this one we're going to start together is the fourth article. And this is where I'm going to get into like doing projects with cloud. And so I want to write a blog post where I talk about like plan mode, auto-accept mode. And then I always want to use examples in my blog posts that are related to product managers. And so like in this blog post, I might think like, let's talk through plan mode and auto-accept mode if you were planning a new feature. So I'm starting to think about like, what's my example going to be in the blog post? And I have an AI product called the Interview Coach. This is a product where in my class where I teach how to conduct effective customer interviews, we do practice interviews with each other in class and then the students can submit their transcripts and get like detailed feedback on how good of a job they did. And the thing with this product is it was built for my story based interview coach or story based interview class. And so the coach gives feedback on story based interviews. And my new feature idea is can I extend it to work with non story based interviews. So this is like a feature idea I have. And so in the blog post, there's a little meta. I'm going to use this feature idea to show how I would use plan mode and auto-accept mode. Right? So I'm going to, this is all I have. This is literally the state of this blog post. This is real. I have not written a single thing. And now I'm going to go over to this terminal window on the bottom and I'm going to launch cloud. And this is in the context of my writing vault. And so my writing vault has a cloud MD that talks about how I like to write and how I like to write with cloud. So it has different context than this tasks window. So like in my writing window, I can't type new task. It doesn't know anything about my task system. I have to do that in my tasks window. So we're going to do this. I don't know why it thinks it's a new folder, but we're going to ignore that for a minute. And then I'm going to say, I want help creating an outline for a new blog post. I do this in plan mode. She's actually with the blog post is about. You can find my early thoughts in. Oh, see, I would not, this is a little weird. I would not do this in the task card. What I would do is I would come to writing. I would go to my cloud code series and I would do a new file. Got it. Let's do plan mode. And that did not go where I wanted it. So we're going to move it in plan mode. And I actually did not talk a lot of enough information because it's not. It's going to look for plan mode in the current directory, but the plan mode is actually in cloud code. So we'll see where it comes back with. We'll see if it finds it. Okay. So basically you have a cloud. Okay. So it's just real quick. You have a cloud.md for your writing a vault that has a bunch of writing styles and like you know, that has stuff, right? Yep. Is that got it? Yeah. So if you look at here on the left, like tasks is a, that you can think about tasks as like a cloud project. I launched this instance of cloud in the context of tasks. And then I have a writing folder and I launched this instance of cloud in the context of the writing folder. So the writing folder has different rules than the tasks folder. They each have their own cloud. So the cloud.md for tasks explains how the task system works. It explains how tagging works. It explains how front matter in obsidian works. So when I just type new task, it knows exactly what to do with that. Whereas my writing folder doesn't have any of that context. It just knows it like you can see here. I told it I want to write a blog post. It found plan mode. It read it. Now it's asking me to read my style guide. And that's because my cloud.md in my writing folder says before we do anything together, start by reading my writing style guide. So I'm going to go in and say yes, it can do that. Do you ever just ask it to use like a skip out of permissions? Because it's kind of annoying to. Yeah, you know what? I have so I just moved everything. Everything used to be in Dropbox and I had all the permissions set up where my tasks could read and edit everything inside tasks and writing could read and everything inside writing. But because I just moved everything, those permissions aren't I literally moved everything yesterday. And so I haven't copied over those permissions yet. I'm learning like when you move things in cloud, it kind of breaks things a little bit. So it's asking me which features do I want to focus on? I actually want to do both. What's your intended audience for this post product? People new to cloud should already know that. That's a little disappointing. Wait, so like is asking you questions because you prompted to ask questions? Ask me questions because it read this plan mode document. And it's now like trying to get more information from me to be helpful. Normally I have a little bit more here, right? This isn't really enough for a cloud to work with yet, but let's see what cloud does. Yeah, see it's trying to do too much right out of the gate. But let's see what it does. Now I understand the direction. Let me create an outline. Fine. It's already got a headline. I'm going to introduce plan mode and auto accept mode. What it is when to use it, what you plan, what it is, the dangers. That's great. Yeah. This is kind of nuts, right? Like it kind of went crazy. So I'm going to tell you it went crazy. It's kind of like why use cloud code to write a product spec. I always wanted to put the spec in a MD file so I can do a bunch of stuff because it tends to do too much. Yeah. So usually, to be honest, usually I have a little bit more. So let's actually play with this draft a little bit. I would probably give Claude something like goals help people new to cloud code do bigger projects. I use planning a new feature as a product manager, as an example throughout. And then we could do I can use my personal experience with expanding the interview coach. I'm going to ignore typos for now because cloud don't care. And then I'm going to do something like less about the features. These features more about how to get Claude to do good work. And let's see if this helps. Got it. Let's see what it comes back with. So okay. So after this, I was like, you're going to ask it to do online research or what's the I can do next. Yeah. So you didn't see already it came back and it's like, oh, okay, I made too many assumptions. Yeah. And it's like, okay, now, like now is this like the right direction. So now I might now I really want to do is ask Claude, like, you asked about research. We got to come out of plan mode for this. Has anyone else written a blog post about this? And it'll go and it'll go search and see what other blog posts are out there. So I'll often do this. I'll often like before I sit down to write, I want to know what else has been out there. If somebody else has written this article for my audience, I'm not going to write it. I'm just going to like write a different article and just link to that article. I want to make sure that I'm writing stuff that's unique. And then now sometimes someone may have written this blog post like in the context of coding. That's fine. Most of my audience isn't going to read that. And so, but I can read that article and learn from their experience and then translate it to product management. So I always use Claude code to like do searches for me. The other thing I use it for while I'm writing is like, I'll make a claim and I'll be like, is that claim true? And then I'll ask Claude, like, can you do some academic research for me and see if there's evidence behind this? Like, is this really a true claim or is it just something that I randomly believe? So let's see what Claude came back with. So a lot of people have written about this. Of course, anthropic has written about it. They have great documentation. Most are written for developers, engineers. Yeah, perfect. I think people wrote like technical stuff about plan more but not about this use case. Yeah. So then I might ask like, okay, how do people search for this kind of content? What keywords from an SEO standpoint should I keep in mind? I almost never do this to start. I do this at the end, but we can do it to see how it does. Oh, that's very smart. I never asked this question from my blog post. So that's important. Yeah. And again, it just goes off and does this thing. And I let it do this thing. And meanwhile, I'll be like over here noodling. I'm like, how am I going to structure this blog post? And like, this is really stubbed out. There's not really a blog post here, right? So I might start to think about an outline and be like, okay, well, the introduction needs to be strong hook around value of doing project work with cloud code. Then introduce like cloud modes, plan, auto, accept, reference, safety article, walk through detailed example, interview coach. So let's see what I came back with. So I found it's really good at keyword research. Like really good at keyword research. I tend to do this after I've written the article, because I really want to write my articles for humans. But then I might tweak some words in my sub headers or my titles to like target higher volume keywords. What is it actually doing? Is this just using Google searches here or is it actually doing some fancy stuff? Yeah, you can see it's just doing searches and looking for what's ranking well. Oh, is that what it's doing? Yeah. Interesting. Okay. Yep. Okay. So it's sort of my SEO researcher. Interesting. And then I could be like, I've started to stub out an outline in plan. Can you suggest? All alternative structures. There's not enough meat here. It's probably not going to do a very good job here, but we'll see what it does. And so I do this. This is literally how I write. I'm like doing all my thinking really rough. Going back and forth with Claude, I'll have questions like, what do I do? Like, how does this work in Claude? Like, I think I know how auto accept mode works, right? But then I'll be writing a blog post about it. I'll be like, is that really right? And I literally will just pop over here and be like, Claude, is that? Are you allowed to do this in auto accept mode? And so that's really nice too. And I know this is a little meta. I'm writing a blog post about Claude code, but Claude can actually answer questions about anything, right? So I could be writing a blog post about how product teams do customer interview analysis. And I can still ask Claude. In fact, I wrote a blog post about how about customer interview analysis with AI. And then when I was writing that article, I was constantly asking Claude to look at research for me, like academic research. Like, what do we know about what is lost when we rely on AI synthesis? What do we know? And a lot of that came from just asking Claude to do the research for me. Got it. So it's very much two-screen kind of process. Yeah, they're definitely using it as a thought partner and like a researcher. Yeah. And so you can see here now Claude came back with like, here's some other ways to structure it. So we could do example first structure, problem solution structure, journey structure, like your personal story. And you can see for each it's kind of like giving me a rough outline. And so what I like about this is like when I write, I usually have a pretty fixed idea of what the structure is in my head. And Claude helps me explore alternatives. So it's like I'm comparing and contrasting in the context of writing, which before working with Claude, I would have literally never done that. And then the other thing that it really helps me with, and maybe I'll pull up my web browser to show this. Let me think about, actually, I think I can show it right here. The article that I'm publishing this coming Wednesday is on safety. So it's how do I teach beginners, Claude Code beginners, how to run an LLM safely on their computer. And you can see, I'll show you, it's organized by tier. So like, what's the risk of letting it read files? And then at the end of every section, I include what Claude is doing and how you know what it's doing. So like, there's these tables of like this just indicates if it's reading. There's like, because I got them assuming most of my readers don't know Unix commands, right? So yeah, I have a nice terminal. Yeah. And there's no way I would have written this article. And I'll show you at the bottom. Look at all these. Look at what we cover. Like, it's insane. This blog post is, you can see, it's like 8800 words. And I created this like quick reference commands table. This is like how Claude reads. This is how it searches beyond your current directory. This is how it searches the web. This is how it writes files. This is how it executes code. And like, this is an awesome reference now for people that have never used Claude code. There is no way I would have done this myself. Claude, you like. Okay. So you, yeah. I started to generate a list like you can see in my outline. Like, I started to generate a list of like commands as I used Claude. Like, oh, this stuff should go in my document. But as I worked with Claude, it taught me like, oh, I also use these other commands. And so this blog post is way more thorough than it would have been if I had just done it on my own. Co-author me with Claude along the way, like section by section. Yeah. Yeah. And then the other thing that I do is like once I get to a complete outline, I actually start writing and I still do all of my own writing. I want it to be in my voice. I personally like to write and I have, I feel like I have a very specific cadence to my writing that like Claude just doesn't really get. It gets close, but not really. And so what I'll do is once I have a really detailed outline, I will write a section. And then as soon as I'm done with the section, I just pop over here and I'll say like, Claude, I wrote the intro. Give me feedback. And then Claude can see the same file I can see, right? So I don't have to cut and paste anything. And then Claude will give me feedback and then it always finds typos and it'll just be like, do you want me to fix the typos and I can just type yes. Why don't we try it? Can you get it to fix the typos right here? Like that doesn't edit your file. Yeah. Can you fix the typos in my plan mode? Got it. Yeah. And it's just going to go and do it. So you can see here, it's showing me a diff of what it's fixing. I don't want it just fixing random typos in my blog post as I write. So one thing I've taught Claude to do is when we review a section, first it tells me what's working well, then it tells me what could be better, what could be clear. It does a technical review. Am I saying anything that's technically wrong? And then the last thing it does is it lists the typos that it found and it asks me if I want to fix those typos. And that's just sort of a safety check. Sometimes like I'm using a word that it thinks is a typo, but it's not. And so it allows me to quickly look down like this is kind of an example. This is one it told me after the fact. But when we're doing our section by section review, it'll be like, here's what I want to change. And then I can just say, yes, change it all. Or I can be like, yes, change it all. But don't change this one. So I kind of still keep like safety guardrails on Claude before it just starts editing my blog post. Interesting. It's interesting that you still, okay, so you still mount it right to actual blog posts from a detailed outline. You still write it. Yeah, I've experimented with letting Claude write stuff. I don't like the voice and the Claude knows a lot about my writing. Like I have my entire product talk archives in here. I have taken the time to develop a really good writing style guide. For me, good writing has a cadence that like you can hear. And that's the part of my writing. Like I just can't get Claude to get 100% right. And then I also like to write to figure out what I think. And so like I don't want to outsource all of that to Claude because I want to force myself to do the thinking myself. Got it. I'm using Claude almost like a sparring partner. So like, here's how I'm thinking about it. What do you think? Oh, I don't really like that. What if we try this other way? And then I do that throughout the whole construction of the blog post. Yeah. It's like having an editor and a researcher and like, you know, just sitting there with you, right? But like full time, right? It's not like I did everything and then you edited it. We're doing it very collaboratively. And then the other piece that I really like is that the way that I used to write, I used to write like a two to three thousand word blog post in like three or four days. And the reason why it would take so long is I would write a section and writing is exhausting, right? And so at the end of writing a section, I'd be like, I'm going to go check my email. And then I'd go get distracted for an hour. Then I'd come back and write another section. But when I'm writing with Claude, as soon as we finish the review of a section, Claude's always like, are you ready for phase two? And I'm like, yeah, okay. I guess I am ready for phase two. So just having Claude like poke me, I maintain momentum. And so I now a lot of my blog posts are a lot more in depth, but they're a lot more detailed. They're getting longer. Like you can see this blog post is pretty darn long. But you'll see there's there is literally no fluff. Like I challenge people, this article is coming out on November 12th. Go read it. You can tell me if you think there's any fluff in it. Like to me, this is just a very detailed guide for how to work with Claude safely. And I wrote all of this myself. It's nine thousand words. And I wrote it in one and a half days. Wow. Like that is insane to me. Okay. Let me ask you like a few questions about this process. Yeah. So you have one window open for writing. Do you just do you ever clear the context or just keep going? And then you let it. That's a really good. That's a really good question. When I'm working on an outline, like when we're developing, so like in this writing exercise, we're developing an outline, I try to keep all of it in the context of the same conversation. Okay. There will be times like I'll keep an eye on whether or not it's going to want to compact the conversation. I always try to keep Claude from compacting. Like if it looks like that's getting close, what I'll do is I'll be like, Claude, we're going to run out of context window. Let's write a summary of where we are that you can read in when I clear the context window. And the reason why I do that is I want oversight on how Claude is compacting the conversation. Whereas if you use the compact, like if you just let Claude use its own compact tool when you run out, I find that it loses a lot of context and detail that I don't want it to lose. So one thing that I've done, I don't always do this with writing, but I always like when I'm working on a project with Claude, in fact, that needs to go in this blog post. So I'm glad we're talking through this. I have Claude trade this document called process notes. And as we're working, if it looks like we're getting towards the end of the compact, the context window, I'll stop and have Claude update process notes. And process notes is just a text file that's like, here's what we did in every session. So that I have a history of what we've done and the decisions that we've made. And then sometimes Claude just loses stuff in the context window. I can be always be like, can you just search process notes? I feel like we already made this decision. And so this is a habit I've gotten into whenever I work with Claude and anything meaty. We're constantly co-creating process notes together. And I'm getting to the point where I have a process for my process notes, where I'm in a right sub-agent that's my document, that Claude will just call to write those process notes when we're running out of context window. Okay, got it. You've gone to like this is like an inception. You have like processes for. I mean, this is the hard part, right? Like when the context window fills up, bad things happen. Like I think you waste a lot of work. Claude loses details. Yeah, it gets dumber. It just gets dumber. And so I feel like it's our job, at least for now, to like maintain this process so that when Claude resets and his memory gets wiped, it can pick up where you left off and you'll be fine. Anthropic has tried to build that in with that compact conversation feature, but it's not very good. So I like to manage it myself a little bit more. Well, I think that's the thing with this, like that's the thing with Claude code. It's just like it's really kind of made for power. Usually, to be honest, like we really want to personalize everything. Like it's not super, it's not super intuitive to use if you're a complete beginner, but you have to like go into the rabbit hole and then it gets more and more powerful. You know what I like about it though for product people is that like using Claude code right now and especially pushing the boundaries with Claude code is living on the edge of what's possible today. And I feel like if we're going to build with AI, like as product people, if we're going to build AI into our products, like we should be living on that edge. And so like even just the stuff we talked about with context windows, I wouldn't have learned any of that if I hadn't been in Claude code all day every day. So now when I go work on like my AI product when I'm working on my interview coach, I have like a depth of experience of understanding how to manage a context window, but there's no way I would have developed otherwise. And so like yeah, like in the long run, is this how we're going to work with LLMs? Probably not like they'll be tooling around it and the labs will get better at managing the context for us. But like as product people, we can't wait for that. We're building AI into our products today. So I feel like we have to be living on that edge so we can build our products on the edge as well. Yeah, you got to build on the edge. You got to learn the latest info. Yeah. So that's kind of I just want to kind of talk about the context window thing a little bit more. So you know, so so context is like everything for how effective these LAM support, right? So I just want to talk about the three layers of context that you talked about in your previous blog post. Yeah. And you don't have to maybe share your cloud the MD file, but maybe like talk about maybe start with the highest layer and talk about what you're putting there. And then and then kind of like, you know, Yeah, so I actually have that article over right here. Yeah. Let's see what state it's in. So this article is life. You can find it at product talk. That over. And in this article, I just talk about like the opening hook is the story about how I just got sick of trying to get clod and chat GPT to like be reliably good. And I realized that like one of the challenges is that in order for cloud to be good, it needs to know all about me and my business. It needs to know that I'm a product discovery coach and needs to know that I write it product talk and needs to know that my audience is cross functional product teams. It needs to know that I have a course business and what all those products are. It even needs to know things like who I work with, right? In order for me to say like not only in my task window, I can add tasks to my to do list, but I can also say create a Trello card on Willena's board. And Willena is my admin, right? And so I can be like create a tree or I can even better. I can create a task file in my system in Markdown and then say create a Trello card on Willena's board using this task. So it's like in my system, I'm creating a task for Willena and then clod goes and pushes it to her Trello board. But that only works if clod has the context like who's Willena and what's a Trello board and like what's a task, right? So in order to get this, like I wrote some pretty lazy stuff, new task, blah, blah, blah. Like in order for that to work, clod has to have this view that we're looking at, doesn't have images. But I just explained this idea that every conversation starts from scratch. We have to create memory. Memory has three layers. You asked about three layers. The first one is my global preferences. Let me actually pop over to the web because I can show some of my clod MD files pretty safely. Okay. So this is my global clod MD, the start of it. You can zoom in a little bit. Perfect. This top section I write about in the blog post is just a little thing I learned. Is that like I don't write my clod MDs anymore? Whenever I'm working with clod, when we're done working, I say, hey, clod, what did you learn about working with me? Like what should we add to the clod MD? So this goes smoother next time. And that's been awesome because I don't have to maintain this file anymore. Clod does. But you can see like I've just defined some personal preferences. Like I always want to plan before clod does anything. I never let clod just do stuff. And I do plan at multiple levels. You could saw that with the blog post. Like I start with just really rough thoughts. We work our way to outline. Once I have an outline, we start writing. So there's just this this file is across all my projects coding, writing tasks, everything. I just want clod to know like this is what I like. And it's not very long. This file doesn't go much further behind beyond this. It's pretty short. I just have a little section on what how I prefer to get feedback from clod. And it's really simple. And this lives you can see here. It lives in my local user directory. So on my Mac, it's like tilde slash t-taurus and then dot clod clod. I'm deep. Yeah, do you put like tourists as a product coach and like, you know, here's my business. And I don't know. No, I don't put any of that here because this file is going to get loaded in the context window every single time you use clod. Got it. So you only want to put stuff in here that you always want it to follow. And so like if I'm using clod to like brainstorm Christmas gifts for my husband, clod does not need to know about product. So I don't want that here, right? But no matter what. You want to keep this short. Yeah. Yeah. This is literally global. So you want to keep it short. It's going to go in every single context window. And like I asked a lot of the time, can my dog eat this food? Like, clod doesn't need to know about product talk for those stupid queries. Right. So like what's really important is you have to keep the context window as clean as possible. Yeah. Right. And so this literally is just my global rules. But you'll see later, if we just scroll down, I have project specific instructions. So this is actually my writing, clod, MD. And in my writing, clod, MD, I have like it says at the start of each section, read my writing style guide. This is actually old. I moved things out of Dropbox. But if you remember, if I go back to the terminal, which is hard to do with this sharing thing here, when I ran, sorry here, when I said, let's work on a blog post together, the very first thing clod did was it went and read my writing style guide. That's right. Yeah. And it's somewhere in here. Yeah. And that's because here, it says at the start of every session, read the writing style guide. Okay. And then this is where I get into my rules about writing. So clod is a thought partner, not a writer. You're acting as an editor. You can do some research and development. And this document is also not very long. It's really just telling clod. This is how we write together. Okay. One thing that is in my global clod MD, which I don't, let's see if I have a screenshot of it somewhere, is this idea of context. So I have my context files defined. So I've created little markdown files and the key is they're little. So I have a lot of them because I want to mix and match them so that I can tell clod, which files matter for the task at hand. And it doesn't ask to read all of my context every time. So I have a business profile that just is like, this is what my business does. Here's where you can find my product descriptions. Here's where you can find my marketing channels. Here's where you can learn about my team. I can show you that one. But it basically is telling clod where to find more details in all these files. And so I think this blog post has a screenshot of that. Yeah. So this is my global clod MD. We already looked at this top part. You can see at the bottom, I'm telling it. Here's where you can find reference context files. And I basically tell it specifically, only use these files if they're relevant to what I'm asking you about. So if I'm asking about something related to my business, go look at my business profile. And if I'm asking you something personal, go look at my personal profile. And then you can. Okay, this makes sense. So you don't have to like load all the shit into the default context. Yeah. So you don't crowd the context. Exactly. So like if I ask it, I have a product file all about my story based customer interview course. So if I ask it like, hey, let's work on the landing page for my story based customer interview course. It already knows where to find details about this course. It already knows details about my company. It already knows details about my target audience. I don't have to tell it any of that stuff. And it's because I've given it an index of context files. So it can just go pull in the relevant stuff. Wow. Okay. But don't you feel like there's going to be like too many files to manage or like I guess you just make clod up for your context files. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So I do in this article. I talk about this. By the way, this article has a really fun use case of like how to use clod to do a competitive analysis. So you can see here I'm having clod like this isn't for me. I used 11 labs as much as if that was my company. And it's generating like, let's see if I can find it. I don't know if I'm going to find it. But here's the goal. Like the key is to give clod just enough to go find what it needs when it needs it. And part of this article is about like, okay, well, how do I maintain all this stuff? Like I have a ton of files now. How do I keep it current? And so what I do is I have this section about like, okay, how do I keep it up to date? The way we're going to keep it up to date is at the end of every session with clod, I literally say, what did you learn about me that we should add to a context file? And then we have a conversation about where to add it. Should it go ahead and a cloud MD? Should it go in one of these LLM context files? Like what's the right place? And then I'm working with clod to make sure like, clod wants to jam everything into your clod MD. You don't want that. That's getting loaded in every conversation. So I work with clod to be like, hey, it seems like that should go in my marketing channel's file. Why don't we add that there? So I think about it as like information about me and my business goes in a context file. Whereas my working preferences, like this is how me and clod work together goes in a clod So basically, yeah, this is a really important tip. Like after every conversation you ask clod, how can you make the context better? And you have all your context in the LLM context folder with a bunch of subflows and files. So how much are you playing this clod employees? They sound pretty useful. How much are you paying? Yeah, I'm on the $100 a month plan. So you can see, I'll show you here in Citian. You can see all my context files. So like for my business, I have a target audience file, a marketing profile, a list of my differentiators, my company overview, my business model. I didn't like sit down and create this all one day. That would have been tedious and horrible. I basically anytime I felt like I needed to describe something to clod. Instead of just doing it that one time and then having to repeat it later, I'd be like, oh, clod, in order to do this task, I feel like you need to know about my differentiators, maybe interview me. And literally, clod will interview you, you can just be like, interview me about my business. And then it will ask you a bunch of questions. And then it will write a context file for you based on what you learned. Got it. Okay. That's a lot of how I did most of this stuff. Okay. Yeah. It's not that you just sat down one day and made all these folders, right? It's not. No, I do it like, gradually over time. So what about like, okay, last question. Let's see. I'm just overwhelmed by all this stuff. Like this is like, yeah, like I want to learn stuff, but like it sounds like you really personalized it for your life. Yeah. Like what are your three tips to get started? Let's say I already use cloud code for like code coding. Like I want to manage my life. The first thing is with context, you don't have to get here overnight. Like I think the simplest rule is whenever you find yourself explaining context to clod, stop and think about am I ever going to have to explain this context to clod again? And honestly, your answer is probably yes. So instead of explaining it to clod, change tasks just for a minute and just be like, clod, I need to explain some context to you. Let's capture it in a context file. Got it. Yep. That makes sense. You probably need to think through like at a minimum, do you work with clod at work and in personal stuff, then maybe set up a work folder and a personal folder. That's it, right? And then I think from there, you can just do it iteratively over time. And that's what I did. Like I literally never sat down and just created all these files. I just, and some of them are just delves, right? They're not that complete. But I know I'll add to them with time. And then this file we're looking at, this profile, I never wrote a word of it. Every time I have clod at a context file, I say what index needs to be updated. And it just figures it out. Got it. Okay. So maybe like the process here is like, think about your weekly counter. What's like the most, like, what's taken most of your time? And then, and then try to, you know, you have clod your employee, try to get it to, you know, give it a bunch of instructions, backgrounds, contexts, and have it save it a bunch of files. And just work with it to start doing stuff. And then at the end of every conversation, you're asked to like add more stuff to context or like improve his prompt. But that's kind of, it's kind of what you do, right? Yeah. Okay. I think there's two steps to this. The first is I have worked with the admin for like 10 years. So I'm really good at like looking at things that I can delegate. And for anybody who's ever delegated something to another person, what makes that work well is to have like a good, like standard operating procedure for the task you're giving them, right? It's not, you can't just say it as someone, another human, like, hey, go do this thing and have them expect them to be able to do it the way that you would do it. And so if you want them to do it the way that you would do it, you have to provide for them like a process. Like here's how I do it. Here's the outcome that I want. And so like I do this with my admin by I record videos. I record a video of how I do things. She then looks at the video. She creates like a Trello checklist for herself. And then that becomes like our standard operating procedure. So we've been doing this for years. And so I'm already good at this muscle of like, what can I delegate? So when I started doing this with LLMs, I thought about it as like, okay, well, if Claude is just a person on my team, how would I delegate to Claude? And so I started by literally looking at my own Trello board and like, what do I need to work on today? And then for every task I got in the habit of like, how can Claude help with this? Got it. Got it. And then there's pieces for some tasks like I don't want to automate. Am I enjoy doing them? Like I enjoy writing. I don't want Claude to write for me. So I don't want to automate that. So I think about like, how can Claude augment this? What do I do while writing that Claude could accelerate? Well, research and web searches and like coming up with alternative analogies. And then there's other tasks like send this stupid receipt to my finance system. I don't need to ever do that. I could automate that. So then I look at like, what do I have to do to give Claude context to be able to automate this completely? So I didn't even start with the things that take the most time. I literally just forced myself all day every day. Every time I do a new task to think about like, how can Claude help? Got it. All right, man. That's a great tip to end on, I think. Just hire your $100 employee and then get it to help on different things. Yeah. And I mean, it's funny that I even thought twice about upgrading from $20 to $100. I started on the $20 plan. I only had to bump to the $100 plan when I was doing both a lot of coding in one week and a lot of writing in one week. So it's like, I was literally pushing hard on Claude for a long time. So you can get pretty far on the $20 plan. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And hopefully an anthropic gets us limits together. Yeah. Okay. So to find your detailed clock, oh, guys, just go to product.org, right? Is that right? Yeah. It's all like we can take a look right here. It's product.org. And it's all like all my recent articles. You can see what is Claude. Stop repeating yourself. Probably by the time this episode goes out, that safety article will be live. Awesome. I'll definitely read it. Yeah. There's a ton here. I'm going to be writing a lot more. Like a lot of my goal for the next several weeks is just to help make Claude code accessible for people, for non-technical people, and to really start to show the power of like pair working with Claude. So if listeners were like excited about this episode, definitely check out this series. It's been a fun to write. And I'm even going to be hosting Claude Code office hours. So if you want to even come and get help, I'm going to be doing that every month. Awesome. Awesome. You should be the anthropologist supposed person. Yeah. That sounds great. Yeah. Yeah. Someone asked me if I was being sponsored by anthropic, and I'm not. If I was, I would disclose that. I really am just a big fan. Yeah, I'm a really big fan too. I'm really a fan of like Cat Boris and the team and what they're building. And yeah, it's funny because they're really kind of trying to build towards the coding use case. But like, you know, there's so much more you can do to build a really good agent. Yeah. Cool. All right, Teresa. Thank you. Thanks so much for your time. Thanks for having me. This has been fun.
