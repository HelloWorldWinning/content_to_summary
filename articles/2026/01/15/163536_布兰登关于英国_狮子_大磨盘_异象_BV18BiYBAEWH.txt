Description:
好的，这是根据您提供的文本内容提炼和总结的核心思想。

### **核心思想摘要**

**一、 总体框架**

该文本是一系列关于英格兰未来的预言性异象的描述与解读，通过大量象征性意象，揭示了一个关于国家、王室和社会即将面临剧烈动荡与权力更迭的警告。

**二、 摘要大纲**

1.  **针对英格兰的宏观警告与审判**
    *   **燃烧与风暴：** 异象以“着火的门楣”和“风暴”开场，预示着迫在眉睫的危机与混乱。
    *   **巨型磨盘：** 一个由风车驱动的巨大磨盘正在“研磨”英格兰，象征着国家正在经历一个缓慢而痛苦的、碾压式的审判或转型过程。
    *   **宗教机构的危机：** 提及“大型教堂”（特别是天主教堂式建筑）以及王室与教会（圣公会）的关系，并看到一个十字架上的人，这不代表殉道，而可能象征着教会体系内部的挣扎与冲突。

2.  **权力机构的象征与衰败**
    *   **狮子：** 作为英格兰的象征，张着嘴的狮子反复出现，暗示着一种公开的威胁或警告。
    *   **燃烧的宫殿：** 宫殿内部（红色墙壁、地毯、金色装饰）和门框上的狮子装饰开始着火，直接象征着王室或国家权力核心正在遭受侵蚀和毁灭。
    *   **其他象征：** “金色锚”、“牛津（Oxford）”等意象指代了英国的传统、稳定与知识体系，但它们都处于这场动荡的大背景之下。

3.  **核心预言：王室的未来与权力转移**
    *   **威廉王子的式微：** 威廉王子在异象中声音“安静”、“被动”，缺乏影响力，其权力被严重削弱。
    *   **乔治王子的崛起与黑暗面：** 未来的乔治王子（约17-19岁）形象截然相反。他身穿类似哈利波特的黑色斗篷，声音“响亮如雷”，充满“巨大的黑暗”和“自由主义影响”，其影响力完全“遮蔽”了其父亲威廉。
    *   **女性角色的缺席：** 异象中明确指出“那个女人已经不在这里了”、“已经去世”，暗示了凯特王妃的缺席，这成为乔治王子“愤怒”的一个原因。
    *   **神秘的沼泽植物：** 沼泽中一株被六边形透明外壳保护、像玫瑰一样发光的植物，象征着某种被隐藏、受保护的核心事物，它与王室的命运紧密相连，可能代表着某种血脉、秘密或生命力。

### **核心观点**

该异象的核心观点是，英格兰及其王室正面临一场由内部腐化和权力代际更迭引发的、充满不祥预兆的剧烈动荡与衰败。

I saw a lion with his mouth open concerning this and I saw above a threshold of a door and it was on fire in the house. I saw a storm and then I saw another lion that looked like this lion right here. You see how the mouth's open and it's laying there on its awesom and stomach? I was showing that. Now, some people say this has to do with the bank of China. Hong Kong. And I was thinking, well, that's interesting. Why am I seeing this lion unless there's another lion that I don't know about in England? Then the Lord said Oxford and he pointed out Oxford and I saw Oxford print like the suit jacket. Like a really nice jacket, like a really nice man's blazer. It looked like Oxford. I heard the Oxford. But a lot of these people said that had to do with the, you know, with England and all that. And I don't know what at all. These are just the pictures of us all. I saw a big bin. And then the gold, the golden anchor. I saw the golden anchor and we talked about that. The red paint on the door. I saw red paint on a door. It was a telephone booth. And the Lord said, don't forget this is about the telephone booth. There's something they're going to try to do. And I saw a cross with a man on it. And I don't believe this has to do in my spirit about martyrdom. He's being martyred because he kept showing me the mega churches in England. And that's why I asked you, is there big Catholic churches because I was seeing look like Catholic catheterals. And I didn't know that the royal family was their own, had their own belief. You know, like they're not Catholic. What'd you call them? Angelica Angelica Angelica. So the queen and all of them have their own thing. Well, then people said that they were announcing that they were trying to break off from the church. And so I don't know. I just, like I said, I see a part here part, but these are the things the Lord was warning me on greatly. The millstone. Then I saw a millstone and this millstone was like this, like of a massive structure. And I saw a windmill powering this and I saw a grinding of England, a grinding. It was, it was turning on this massive millstone and it was grinding something on it. But as it was turning, it was moving slow and it was, you can hear, I can hear in the spirit, it was a massive stone, but it was attached to a, a wooden shaft that was being turned by a windmill. And it was grinding a substance up like this. Do you see that like that? There you go. Just like that. It was a massive though. It filled the whole room. And the palace with the shaft of light. And I saw the pouch, the shaft of light. And I saw something about that. It was red walls. It had red walls. I had looked like red rugs at gold and there was a lion that was on the top of the door frames and I could see lions on the top of the door frame, but there was, but it started to catch on fire. The trans-crarefire. Trans-crarefire. And then the plant and the fog and the swamp. Oh, then I saw a plant in a swamp that was a, had a shell on it that looked like hexagons that were blind and black that were transparent. And you could see this film on this flower. And it almost kind of looked like beauty. You know, like in the movie, Cartoon Beauty and the Beast with the rose is keeping the beast alive, not turning into the beast. It was a rose and it was a beautiful color of a red rose that was glowing in the cartoon. That flower, whatever was in that this capsule was glowing and a, with fog all around it and was on a swamp on a lily pad. And it was representation of something. But I saw transition coming to the royal family in a major way concerning even the king. And William. George. I know that. George was behind. I saw William lifted up. His voice wasn't very loud. I'll say it like this. His voice was not loud in the vision of what I'm seeing. I can give you more details now. His voice was quiet. His voice was passive. His voice did not get heard as like, uh, influence. He didn't have a lot. This little boy was a young man coming up with great influence and great, uh, thunder. And his voice was very scary. There was great darkness on this little voice and there was influence of great liberal influence on this little voice. This little voice overshadowed this voice. This voice was not as powerful as this voice. I could not see the woman. She was no longer here in the vision. She was gone. She'd been deceased and he was angry. This little boy was angry. I saw him rise up and was over like to overshadow this voice. And he was the main focal point of an influencer. This I saw him very clear. He was probably 17 years old, 18, 19 years old. And he was, he was wearing black. He had a black, uh, cape on. He had it looked like Harry Potter. He had a like a Harry Potter cape on. Uh, it had a very Harry Potter vibe. He looked very dark. Like Harry Potter. It had the, the, the maroon, uh, collar with a black cape that looked like, like, like, like it went to his waist. Now am I saying this little boy is black, dark and evil and all this? I'm not trying to. I'm just describing a vision that I had.
