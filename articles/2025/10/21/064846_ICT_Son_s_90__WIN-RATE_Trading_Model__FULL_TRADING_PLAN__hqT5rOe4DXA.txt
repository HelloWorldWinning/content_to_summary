Description:
好的，这是根据您提供的文本内容提炼和总结的核心思想。

### **大纲式总结**

**I. 模型概述**
*   **A. 模型名称:** ICT 儿子交易模型 (ICT's Son's Trading Model)。
*   **B. 核心特点:**
    *   **高胜率:** 声称拥有85%至90%甚至更高的胜率。
    *   **负风险回报率:** 止盈点数小于止损点数 (10点止盈 vs 12点止损)，是一种典型的剥头皮（Scalping）策略。
    *   **新手友好:** 被描述为一个适合初学者的模型。

**II. 交易框架与参数**
*   **A. 适用资产:** 主要用于 E-mini 纳斯达克100期货 (NQ)，但也可应用于外汇货币对 (如 EUR/USD, GBP/USD)。
*   **B. 交易时间:** “白银子弹” (Silver Bullet) 时段，即美东时间上午10点至11点，也可扩展至上午9:30至11点的整个开盘时段。
*   **C. 交易参数:**
    *   **止损 (Stop Loss):** 12 Handles (点)。
    *   **止盈 (Take Profit):** 10 Handles (点)。

**III. 具体执行步骤**
*   **A. 高时间框架分析 (15分钟或5分钟图):** 寻找一个流动性猎取动作 (Run on Liquidity)，即价格突破一个前高或前低。
*   **B. 低时间框架入场 (5分钟、1分钟或30秒图):**
    1.  **信号确认:** 等待价格在低时间框架上扫过一个反向的摆动高/低点。
    2.  **结构转变:** 在上述动作后，观察到市场结构向预期方向发生转变 (Market Structure Shift)。
    3.  **入场点:** 在市场结构转变后形成的公允价值缺口 (Fair Value Gap, FVG) 内设置入场订单。

**IV. 视频作者的个人策略调整**
*   **A. 偏好时间框架:** 更喜欢使用5分钟图进行入场。
*   **B. 风险管理:** 使用10点的止损。
*   **C. 盈利目标:** 追求更高的风险回报比 (如1:2或1:3)，目标是小时图上更重要的流动性区域，而非固定的10点。

**V. 推广内容**
*   视频作者推广其付费Discord社群“Market Militia”，提供实时交易、课程、训练营和挑战赛账户赠送等服务。

### **核心结论**

该模型是一个高胜率但负风险回报率的日内短线交易策略，旨在通过在特定时间窗口内捕捉由流动性驱动的快速行情来获利。

---

### **核心框架**

该内容的核心框架是基于ICT（Inner Circle Trader）概念的“白银子弹”交易模型变体，其核心逻辑为：在高时间框架确定流动性目标后，于特定交易时段内，在低时间框架上寻找“**流动性猎取 -> 市场结构转变 -> 公允价值缺口回踩**”的序列作为精确入场点。

What is up guys? Welcome back to another video today. We're going to be talking about an exciting new model. This is ICTs very own sons trading model. Okay. Now let's get into the video because this one's going to be a good one. I'm going to show you an in-depth full plan. This is the only video you're going to need me to watch on his son's model. Okay, I'm going to teach you it how he teaches it. We've all learned it. We all know it. It's got a high strike rate. He tried it started trading it last Thursday and he's had 100% win rate. You can probably back test and have anywhere from 85 to 9 year more win rate with this. Okay, so let's get into it. We're going to be looking at runs on liquidity from the 15 or 5 minute. And then we're going to look at the 5, 1 or even down to the 32nd, which is what he's using, the 32nd to enter. His stop loss is 12 handles. And take profits, 10 handles. Now, why are we talking handles because you can use it in USD pairs of your USD GBP USD and the and 4X. But the main asset that he's using is in futures on top step is the E mini NASDAQ 100 futures. Okay. Now, he trades in the silver bullet window, which is from 10 to 11. Okay. Now we can be looking from 9, 30 to 11 though and have that whole opening kill zone to use. Okay. So we see here on the 15 minute. Let's look at liquidity here. We've taken some liquidity there on the 15. We have some nice equal lows down here. We're sell side liquidity. Okay. So, drop down to the 5 minute. Okay, come up. Now, bias here is sell side because this is pretty clean down here. Okay. We've already taken out a lot of the sellers here in this whole range down and tapped up into this small 5 minute for value gap here, which you can see if we drag it over. Okay. We started to shift down. So now I'm waiting for this highs taken. Okay. This high is taken. Let's move forward here. Okay. So if we see here, this swing high here, just in here. See that swing high there. We take that high. Okay. Boom. Okay. So take that high in here. Go down to the one minute. Have a nice fair value gap in here. We broke market structure with this with down. Okay. So let's take an entry here. Short in that gap. Oh, I won. Short in here. Okay. Well, handles. And we're, and ICT says the Senate only goes for 10. Okay. This is a beginner model. You're going to be negative are, but it has a really high strike rate. Okay. So we're already down. And within two candles, boom, you've already hit your take profit. Okay. Now. I mean, this is it. Let's see if we go down to the 32nd. It's the same thing. Nice break to the downside. We have this. For value gap, we don't enter. We have another one break market structure. Let's see if we get. Cool. So we break structure again. Here. We leave this fair value gap. See if it takes you out there. It does. But again. One there. One there. No return back. But as soon as we took this five minute high there, right, this was. That five minute high. On the one minute. Fair value gap. Entry 12 panel stop 10 point take profit. Now. We looked down where was the sell side, right? Move this over. We could have targeted this low here. Right. And then we have sell side down here. See if we take that out. Let me use the. Well, sell side taken. Okay. Now I should use a himself. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Okay. Now I should use a himself says this is not a complete model. Okay. But. He's had. Huge, huge win rate with this. Okay. Now the way I trade. We'll just go through this real quick. The way I trade is off to five minute. Okay. My favorite entry is off to five minute. I believe this. Is where I entered off this five minute. Okay. Silver bullet style. In this gap. Okay. To take the. To take the. Here. We're going to get a six to. Retracement. And then this is where we take our short from. Right in here. Okay. I like to have a 10. Point stop. And then I will shoot for. One to two or one to three. In this case, if we look on the one hour. Today. We had this nice sell side here. And we had some nice sell side down here. Okay. So go back to five minute. So targeting this low down here. Would be a nice one to five. Okay. Let me see. I'm going to log in here real quick. Okay. Let me see. I'm going to log in here real quick. Okay. Show. Show. Show. Now. I'm going to sample this. OK. Well, if we look at the discord here. I posted them in market militia. Right here. Take this cell. Was going to take it to sell side, but got out early. Okay. So took the self to five minute. I really like five minutes inside of the, the silver bullet window from 10 to 11. That's my bread and buddy. That's what I trade live every single day. Okay.
