Description:
好的，这是根据您提供的文本内容提炼的核心观点和摘要。

### **核心摘要大纲**

#### **I. 核心观点：GPT-5引发的对AI创新路径的反思**
*   **A. GPT-5性能增长放缓：一个有趣的转折点**
    *   从GPT-4到GPT-5的性能飞跃感，远不如从GPT-3到GPT-4那般深刻。
    *   这种放缓并非坏事，它恰恰为新的、颠覆性的思想和技术提供了进场空间，可能意味着AI研究将变得“再次有趣”。
*   **B. “量化扩展”（Scaling）路径的局限性**
    *   过去几年AI领域的主导范式——即通过扩大模型和数据规模来提升性能——可能正显示出回报递减的迹象。
    *   仅仅依赖这条路径，可能无法通向人们期望的通用人工智能（AGI）或真正革命性的突破。

#### **II. 创新的悖论：成功如何扼杀未来创新**
*   **A. “创新者困境”：从OpenAI与谷歌的案例看**
    *   一个巨大的成功（如ChatGPT）会让组织倾向于将所有资源汇聚于此，从而固化在成功的路径上，丧失了探索其他新方向的创新能力。
    *   历史上，创新者被更新的创新者颠覆的故事反复上演。谷歌发明了Transformer架构，却被OpenAI抓住了机遇，这便是典型案例。
*   **B. 目标的欺骗性：对标基准（Benchmark）的风险**
    *   当前的AI竞赛过分依赖基准测试（如数学奥林匹克竞赛），这是一种“目标的欺骗”。
    *   即使模型在测试中获得高分（达到“博士水平”），也并未创造出相应水平的“新数学”或新科学。这表明，我们可能只是在优化“玩测试的能力”，而非真正的“智能”。

#### **III. 如何培育真正的颠覆性创新**
*   **A. 放弃具体目标，拥抱开放式探索**
    *   真正的伟大成就无法被精确规划。企业需要放弃对短期目标（如OKRs, KPIs）的过度执着，为没有明确目标的探索性研究提供空间。
    *   创新的本质是发现“有趣的垫脚石”（interesting stepping stones），而非直奔一个遥远的目标。
*   **B. 企业文化挑战：容忍“无用”的研究**
    *   在大公司内部设立“创新实验室”面临巨大文化风险，容易引起其他部门的嫉妒（“他们凭什么像孩子一样玩耍”）。
    *   领导层需要非凡的勇气来保护这种看似“无用”的探索，因为从创新的角度看，做“无用”之事往往是通往突破的最佳途径。
*   **C. 信念（Conviction）与计划（Planning）的区别**
    *   作者并不反对所有决策。OpenAI早期聚焦大模型，并非基于一个“创造ChatGPT”的遥远计划，而是源于一个“扩展神经网络会产生有趣结果”的强大信念（Conviction）。在当时，这种信念本身就是一种与众不同的、具有发散性的选择。

#### **IV. 对中国科技发展的启示**
*   **A. 警惕“计划”对创新的潜在危害**
    *   中国在制定和执行计划方面有很强的传统和成功经验。但《为什么伟大不能被计划》这本书提供了一个重要的反向视角：对于颠覆性创新领域，强计划性可能是有害的。
*   **B. 教育反思：超越高压测试，培养创新能力**
    *   高压、标准化的应试文化虽然能筛选人才，但可能无法有效反映学生在真实世界中所需的创新潜力。
    *   社会需要探索更人性化的方式来识别和培养人才，减少对孩子的过度测试压力，因为解决现实问题的能力与应试技巧并不完全等同。

### **核心要点（一句话总结）**

真正的颠覆性创新源于开放式探索而非目标驱动的规划，当前AI领域对“量化扩展”和基准测试的过度依赖，可能正将我们引向一条“欺骗性”的道路，而回归对“有趣垫脚石”的探索才是通往未来的关键。

### **内容的总览框架**

**“开放式探索 vs. 目标驱动”的创新二元论**

该对话内容构建在一个核心的二元对立框架之上，即 **开放式探索 (Open-Ended Exploration)** 与 **目标驱动 (Objective-Driven)** 两种创新范式之间的张力。演讲者通过这个框架剖析了AI领域的发展现状、企业创新困境以及未来方向：

1.  **目标驱动路径**：
    *   **特征**：以明确的目标（Objectives）、关键绩效指标（KPIs）和基准测试（Benchmarks）为导向。
    *   **优势**：擅长实现可预测的、渐进式的改进。
    *   **风险**：极易陷入“目标的欺骗性”（Deception of Objectives），即在指标上进步，却偏离了真正重要的宏大愿景（如“智能”本身），最终导致创新停滞。当前的AI竞赛是此路径的典型体现。

2.  **开放式探索路径**：
    *   **特征**：由好奇心和信念（Conviction）驱动，不设具体终点，而是不断寻找“有趣的垫脚石”（Interesting Stepping Stones）。
    *   **优势**：是通往无法预见的、颠覆性创新（Greatness）的唯一途径。
    *   **挑战**：需要容忍“无用”和失败，对组织文化和领导力有极高要求，难以在成熟的大公司中生存。早期OpenAI的探索精神是此路径的代表。

整个对话的核心论点是，尽管目标驱动方法在商业上看似安全高效，但它会扼杀伟大的可能性。当前AI领域若想突破瓶颈，必须重新审视和拥抱开放式探索的价值。

ediyor taste'swhat's your take嗯, let's see let's think嗯 there's a general question in the field of artificial intelligence whether the path that it's been on for the last couple years which is just scaling um and data is really the path to the most exciting revolutionary form of AI which some people might call AGI I think it's interesting whether we're seeing evidence that that the returns are slowing maybe or whether this is confirming that this is the correct path and it seems like some people disagree on this question um I think it wouldn't be surprising if the scaling path does not on its own lead all the way to whatever this holy grail is it's not the only thing that matters in intelligence so I think that um it's not a surprise necessarily if if just continuing along this path doesn't lead to something revolutionary every time you come out with a new model from this kind of process but it just represents that there's room for a breakthrough probably at this point in time because I'm a researcher so I mean I look at like any limitation as an opportunity so somebody can disrupt um, so things actually makes it a really interesting time um, because if things are starting to slow a bit on the path that we've been going down um, there's room now for maybe more more interesting ideas to come in and do new things even though from a kind of product perspective it's been exciting for less it's been exciting for the last couple of years but it's gotten kind of less exciting from a research perspective because there's basically everything is just following this path that we've already set How about Joe, what do you think of GPD 5? Yeah, I think it's it seems pretty in not controversial to say that the jump from GPD 3 to GPD 4 seems more profound than the jump from GPD 4 to GPD 5 why is that? It certainly is an amazing piece of technology it is a bit unclear to know where we are on this trajectory whether this paradigm is plateauing or whether there's more juice to come from continue this scale there's a lot of uncertainty um, but I guess I hope uh, I hope it's kind of running out of steam again, that's more just kind of my personal interest like it would be more interesting um, if we needed different kinds of technologies and I was, you know, suspicion that there is something strange about the way that these models are trained relative to how humans understand things and that they're likely are stepping stones to come I don't think the transformers are the end of the line in terms of where this story goes and so I'd be excited for something different does the story of OpenAI tell us that once open exploration succeeds and the achievements were recognized it is prone to fierce competition or virus competitions that undermine the innovative atmosphere is that hard to avoid? Yeah, I think that that is a danger that is hard to avoid throughout history we see cases where in innovator in any field at all does something revolutionary um, becomes the top performer and then are disrupted later on by some new innovator who comes in and wasn't known and that's just the story of technology and many other things so there does seem to be a phenomenon where um, a big win can cause you to start converging um, like you just start to put all your resources into the thing that it looks like it's the winner um, and you maintain your dominant position for some time and then until someone who's more innovative has a different kind of idea and you've lost the ability to innovate as much that seems to happen a lot I think it's um, it's a deep, it's a deep issue because it's not just that somebody lost the will to innovate it's also that the road that you took to innovate doesn't work twice you may have followed certain principles and certain heuristics on the road to your amazing discovery um, and that worked for you because you were successful so now you think you can just do that again but actually the next innovation is going to have a different story so the formula that worked for you is no longer the formula that will work um, and I think all innovators fall into this trap some innovators do kind of reinvent themselves every, you know, ten years it's really difficult, I think to fight your own nature or your own heuristics, your own curiosity but what do you think of Google? it's both a great commercial company and the birthplace of AI research yeah I think Google said it was a really interesting place yeah they didn't invent the transform architecture the thing that really set off the language model revolution um, and it's true also that as a larger company maybe they were a little more cautious when it came to deploying the technology and also you know that might not be a bad thing but I think the story goes that maybe I can remember as Google maybe had a kind of a chat-like model um, before um, before opening I did yeah you know Google was the first to discover the direction of large models but missed out on GPT revolution and lost a large number of AI talents yeah once the, the giant was awakened I think now they're going basically toe-to-toe I think with, with Anthropic and with, I'm opening eyes maybe caught up in some respects um, but it's true like they, it took, it's being a bigger company, being more bureaucratic and all the kinds of things that happen you're almost consumed by your own success because that's kind of like a story that happens over and over again um, but I think they continue to do great research as far as I know what happened with OpenEI was a disruption obviously it's a painful story for Google to watch that unfold with things that came from Google but it's just, it's just eternal story of innovation things like codec was disrupted by digital photography um, they didn't regain their footing as well I think Google though, it has like, like Joel said, to some extent regained its footing so it's, it's pretty competitive now um, and DeepMind has certainly had some considerable achievements um, even outside language models like with AlphaFold and things like that but there was a moment that they missed I mean that's clear um, to their regret I'm sure so help them mature enterprises avoid having to go management sidephone innovation that was a big question, very important question for companies like Google our book does provide potential lessons that could help with that some of those lessons are that you do have to sometimes let go of your objectives in order to innovate um, and I think that as companies mature and become dominant and extremely successful um, they become more likely to be objectively oriented like Google was one of the popularizers of OKRs and KPIs or OKRs objectives and key results which is used throughout the industry kind of a reinforcing cycle objectives have led us to our success let's impose even more objectives it can be very hard in that environment which also tends to become more bureaucratic because you, the bigger you are the more bureaucracy you need to keep things moving large companies say things like let's, let's establish a research lab like Google Brain or something like that um, we really believe in exploratory research like you guys are here to do that, everybody should be happy but what happens I think in practice is that people see and understand that ultimately they're still being evaluated based on the companies OKRs um, and the researchers can't be fooled they can see that their colleague got promoted because he helped something that helped with Google's bottom line um, and then when you see that you think they don't, they say they care about this but the people who get rewarded are the people who actually advance the objective and so I'm also going to respond to that signal because I also want to get a bonus this year um, and I want to get a raise, I think this is where I start up to often have a disruptive advantage because that's so hard to do is if you create an innovation lab inside of a big company the people not in the lab will become jealous and angry people in this lab they don't have to help us to advance our objectives they can just do anything they find interesting then everyone else says why do those people get to do that they're getting paid all this money basically to sit around like children in playground and do whatever they want it has a cultural risk for a big company but the whole paradoxical point is that doing something that's not useful is actually the best thing to do from an innovative standpoint so I think the challenges that a big company faces are massive and require a courage like me telling you you should do whatever you want that doesn't make me feel confident that things are going to work out um, I would rather tell you that you have to achieve X this year or else I'm going to like not give you a raise then I feel safe because I'm protecting myself by threatening you with some kind of penalty that's what our book is for I think it's to empower people to have that courage I would hope that the leadership of these companies would read the book not because it's going to help Joel and I make money it's going to be some tiny amount for us but because it could change the culture and this could empower them then to make these very difficult decisions like when somebody creates a lab it requires this kind of courageous change to truly protect it and cause it to be what it's supposed to be I'm pretty sure many Chinese entrepreneurs have already read your books but here's a piece of history OpenAI was established in 2015 and it encouraged scholars to explore virus cutting-edge directions in its early days which sounds in line with your proposition more free exploration rather than planning right? but two years later hundreds of millions of dollars were about to run out and the key question is open-ended exploration really sustainable and who should put the bill for this? I think there are definitely settings where open-ended exploration is sustainable within universities you have basic research and that's funded by the public usually on the long run you know the public gets more out than they put in there's like returns on that investment which are pretty large it does become more tricky when you try to have open-ended exploration within a corporate setting where there's the imperative that you have a certain time scale under what you're under pressure to kind of optimize profits or you know in the worst case if you don't make enough money the company might stop existing so I think there it does become the realm of really well situated companies to really have pre-ranged it to explore as broadly as possible but even thinking about kind of like more limited ways of exploring can still be useful I think it's definitely sustainable as long as the company is healthy and so I think success should not be an impediment to open-ended exploration you know like societies where people are barely able to eat are not innovating like innovation starts happening when you're in a situation where you can afford to take risks because it doesn't mean you're going to die it's kind of counterintuitive that you know a lot of people think that successful should we will destroy the ability to do this in principle you should be able to continue because you're successful I should add though that you can be doing open-ended innovation in a small company that's definitely possible so facing the imminent de-placion of funds in 2017 OpenEI decided to focus all its resources on large language models which give birth to CHEPGPT does this conflict with the idea of greatness cannot be planned how can we strike a dedicated back balance between diverges and converges I should add, that's just an early add-on when we arrived at OpenEI they were doing more than just language models so I don't think they were completely converged on language models but I believe you that there may have been some decision made I maybe that somebody saw that as a road forward it may have happened I think it doesn't contradict anything about the book because our book does not argue against conviction like we're not saying like you can never make a decision if you have a strong feeling that this path is interesting our book would endorse going down that path just that we're not we're just that we're saying that you shouldn't go down that path only because you think it leads to some goal some far off goal if they made a decision in 2017 to invest in language models had absolutely no awareness or expectation that CHEPGPT would be created like six years later whatever seven years later and so that wasn't the goal that was driving the decision in 2017 is probably more a conviction that this is an interesting technology which is a great conviction obviously in hindsight a really interesting conviction at that very very early stage because I mean GPT1 was just garbage I mean it was not a good product for anything but it was interesting it was very interesting and someone who had the courage to then invest more in that is a very smart person and there's kind of this interesting phenomenon where you might be you might exhibit being divergent by conferred jing and like I think opening eye is an example of this which I think the the constant through line from the early days was I think a conviction that scaling neural networks would yield interesting results as a company that were kind of converged on that hypothesis which no one else was really kind of like falling to the same level of conviction you know really high conviction that that would have paid off the research would continue in more stepping stones to be built and the system is a whole hopefully we'll continue to that so what do you think of the ongoing race regarding artificial intelligence and you have proposed deception of objectives is this reflected into this AI race I think definitely it's reflected in the race you always see these benchmarks reported like some math tests and programming tests which in my opinion is what our book cautions against that doing that can be dangerous for innovation and deceptive in the sense that we may actually see scores increasing on these tests and not actually be increasing what we think of as intelligence at first it may not be true but something happens along the way where we have become too obsessed with these particular metrics and then we lose the big picture and we're losing the big picture is the deception there's some interesting things like we see programs that you know computer systems that can actually succeed and get a gold medal on a math Olympiad amazing achievement from a benchmark perspective so where is all the new math since it's PhD level as these guys like to say like the leaders like to say of all these different labs it's PhD level so where's the new math? like why hasn't it invented a lot of new math? maybe one possibility is here is that getting better and better scores on these tests is not going to lead to a lot of new math and that would be because it's deceptive by being obsessed with the objective we're risking that that could be what's happening that we're on a deceptive path it's interesting that this doesn't seem to be causing more concern people are like oh it'll it's coming but everything is benchmark driven means that the entire path could be highly deceptive it's like right now it's every time in recent history that a new model is released it's better on the benchmarks than everything else like that starts to make it look like these benchmarks are gameable it shouldn't be the case that seems a bit suspicious like that actually we're actually playing to the benchmark rather than playing to this other thing which is intelligence yeah I completely agree with Ken that the benchmarks can be misleading if you just look at the history of AI we've been through this cycle before where neural networks like 20-30 years ago were kind of like exciting then they were bad after the release of I think the Perceptron's book and then there was they were went through winter in the summer up sundown yeah up sundown we may not think this is the end of the story if AGI is around the corner I don't know if we're ready for it but I might be barreling towards it anyway but I do think basically that there's a big risk of deception here from the perspective of the innovation at most fear which company is most similar to OpenAI back then among the start-up companies in Silicon Valley or around the world when is back then you mean when opening I was founded is that what you mean? maybe by 20-20 or 2022 I think I think there's a strong temptation here for Joel and I to cite our own company right now it's just okay we're at LiLa Sciences and this is a new thing and we've started a new open-endedness team the feeling of starting a new open-endedness team obviously reminds me of starting at OpenAI where we started at Openendedness team okay so could you give us more introduction that will come fake? okay so LiLa Sciences which Joel and I have both joined recently is trying to create what the company calls scientific superintelligence and so it's taking this notion of superintelligence which is what a lot of companies talk about but aiming it particularly at science the advancement of science itself and I think there's a couple of unique aspects to their hypothesis like one being that we won't really see great scientific revolution which is what many companies are talking about like they ultimately say like in the end when you get to the superintelligence the really big benefit will be that there'll be new medicines, new energies like new materials, like all kinds of scientific revolution will come because of the superintelligence but here in LiLa what they're saying is that that won't happen just from internet data you have to have actual interaction with the world in order to test hypotheses get more information grow as a scientist as a researcher think that it's arguable that like because of the convergence of all of these different scientific expertise in a model that's doing this science and actually getting better at all of science at once that there's a plausible hypothesis that you end up with an intelligence that different that is different from other frontier labs I think the other part of the hypothesis is that they really believe in open-endedness because if you think about it science is one of the most open-ended things that you could possibly exist like the enterprise of science is what open-endedness is about it's some kind of tree of discovery that never ends and so I think that that gives it that feeling of the next big things are going to happen here and that was how opening I felt to some extent too at the time I was expected any other companies from Silicon Valley no answer drop out of your mind I'm not trying to avoid to highlight other companies there's no doubt that there's innovation coming out of Silicon Valley the problem that we face is that like the next big thing is always invisible until it's visible like I I don't know what it is the opening is a huge phenomenon I just don't know what it is if I did I would tell you okay how do you view the development of AI in 2025 do you think it's most really fast or exciting or anything else Timmy is still moving quickly I mean I've been interestingly surprised by the way they have rough edges but it feels like that's just one of the central kind of practical developments but then there's this other thing that happens where you suddenly have to debug where you don't understand what happened because you didn't write the code and that then takes a lot of more time to debug than it used to and so you've got both this kind of huge acceleration and this other the bugs are going to reduce over time as these improve and so it's going to be more and more acceleration but it leaves it at a kind of an interesting delicate inflection point where you know it's interesting to see where it goes from here so did you notice deep-six innovation well I guess it's like hard to to miss it in at least this sense that like there's like this dramatic shock to the stock market and it's super accomplished and yeah obviously it represents another step in the kind of evolving race dynamics in what teams and what countries and what people are producing the models that are the best in the world and I think China has been ramped to catch up with the US on that front I also noticed that China has been changed because of deep-six innovation when you say change just to clarify what you mean by that maybe the Silicon Valley pay more attention to Chinese AI company yeah I definitely yeah I mean it's got everybody's attention for sure a lot of attention a lot of dynamics have changed since that moment between China and US gets into a tense situation so what's your view on technological development of the two countries where China and US embark on different paths it has resulted in a tense situation and I think it's very unpredictable what will happen we see developments internationally where there seem to be events that push the countries apart but then we see other events where maybe surprisingly they come together and so it's kind of hard to say where this will end up yeah there's also a great point in this book the superstition of management by objectives in society may hindere breakthrough innovation Historically China is a country that is really good at devising plans and we have also gained results from this planning what do you think about the future development of China technology is there anything you want to remind China of well I mean the answer is kind of obvious I mean if China really likes planning and our book is called Why Greatness Could be Planned you know we can remind China is maybe interesting as a counter argument to what is potentially the traditional way of thinking about achievement I know there's a lot of planning in China I don't want to oversimplify because like people in China know way more than me about how things are in China like both Joel and I have acknowledged that we're not against all planning but in certain areas like especially disruptive innovation like planning can actually be harmful your future is a matter of innovation you're trying to find the right thing to do for you you kind of have to innovate for yourself I think that's one of the reasons that the book did well in China because maybe it does provide some kind of unique arguments that aren't usually shared in widely in China and so that gives an opportunity to think about the mechanics of innovation and how it works and maybe from different perspectives Everett, it comes from several friends who talked about the challenges of education lots and lots of tests and incredibly high stakes tests we have a test culture in the US where that maybe a reminder that yeah what these tests reflect obviously there's always this question of how do you allocate space and really elite educational institutions and that's always a difficult thing and I guess that the hope would be that there's got to be more humane ways to help identify people with interesting potential and that the tests that people take may not really reflect much about their potential as much as their ability to really focus on a test which may not be reflective of the skills needed to innovate in the real world so I hope this is a message also for the essence of China that we would ease up on kind of the ways that we put children through onerous, unfun testing experiences you know what I saw Ken's painting just behind him do you know what this means? it's a Chinese writing who sent it to you? it's a gift they said the commission that Chinese artist to make that and sent it to me in the mail and so I thought it it kind of represents my field so it's like I put it on the wall and I thought it was very nice yeah and this related to our interview today thank you oh okay get here that there's a lot of interesting commentary that's true actually I was really worried我第一次 pokemon di Before你准备条案就是一个我本期早上还想的加以这一个自己评估现场还是会更敌我看有很多人话去救面我难道能让我发生过毁救人权令我最 la Fontern

ago当时我当时我当时我当时当时我当时当时我当时当时我当时当时我当时当时我当时当时我当时但是 many thousands of people now have been influenced by the idea of why greatness cannot be planned including across many different countries even which is just crazy as many times in my life where I discovered something that upended my entire life in a way that I would never have anticipated I mean, I guess the easiest one is I guess the easiest one is I know idea that this would be important or not and I guess like there's many things in probably each of our lives that are that way where if not for that one moment your life would branch off into something else and there would be just a different life for me and so that's definitely a treasure to me Okay, thank you for your time Thank you for that It was a pleasure Bye
