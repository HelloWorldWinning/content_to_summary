Description:
一、引言
*   **母子关系破裂：** 56岁的Rose与27岁的独子Ben原本关系亲密，但因Ben对依托咪酯电子烟（Kpods）成瘾，母子关系严重受损。
*   **成瘾后果：** Ben在Kpods影响下曾对母亲施暴，并伴有严重的戒断症状。

二、成瘾与危机升级
*   **初次施暴与自杀尝试 (2024年11月)：** Ben在情绪激动时试图跳窗，Rose阻止时被掐脖、头部撞墙。Rose为此报警并申请人身保护令（PPO）。
*   **再次危机 (2025年7月31日)：** Rose没收Ben的电子烟并将其锁在门外，Ben高剂量吸食Kpods后试图爬窗入室，Rose再次报警。
*   **身心影响：** Ben出现脱发、体重骤降、皮肤病变，并表现出精神异常（颤抖、胡言乱语）。

三、Rose的应对与支持
*   **发现与根源：** Rose于2024年10月发现Ben的异常行为，后得知其Kpods成瘾是为了应对工作压力，由侄女的女友介绍。
*   **艰难的抉择：** 作为单亲母亲，Rose在恐惧中度日，被迫藏钱、锁门。面对无助，她将依托咪酯被列为C类毒品视为挽救儿子的唯一机会，并坚定地送他去康复。

四、政策与社会支持
*   **政府干预：** 2025年8月17日，总理宣布将电子烟视为毒品问题处理。
*   **法律法规：** 2025年9月1日，依托咪酯被列为《滥用毒品法》下的C类毒品，对Kpod滥用者实施更严厉的惩罚（罚款、强制康复）。
*   **康复计划：** 政府推出QuitVape计划，由IMH、Nams、We Care等机构提供戒断和康复服务。

五、Ben的康复之路
*   **入院治疗：** Ben因自杀倾向被送入精神疾病学院（IMH）两周，后于2025年9月3日出院。在此期间，他同意接受康复。
*   **Nams康复：** 在国家成瘾管理服务中心（Nams）接受了三周的心理咨询、情绪管理课程、互助小组和治疗活动。
*   **持续恢复：** 出院后，Ben继续在We Care社区服务中心参加小组会议，并通过删除社交媒体应用、切断与毒友联系来预防复发，秉持“一天一天过”的康复理念。
*   **康复动机：** Ben渴望重获正常生活，掌控金钱，不再让毒品损害健康。

六、Rose的未了心结
*   **个人影响：** Ben的成瘾对Rose造成了巨大的精神打击，导致她辞去医院秘书的工作。
*   **道歉的渴望：** 尽管Ben正在康复，Rose仍未原谅他，并迫切需要Ben为自己的行为真诚道歉，因为她曾感到生命受到威胁。
*   **Ben的回应：** Ben表示希望在完全康复后，能真诚地向母亲道歉，认为目前最重要的是专注康复。

七、专家观点与康复数据
*   **专家区分：** 精神病学专家Munidasa Winslow区分了“戒断”与“康复”，强调康复是主动解决导致吸毒深层问题的过程。
*   **初步成效：** 政策收紧后，已有39名依托咪酯电子烟使用者开始或将开始接受康复；IMH的电子烟戒烟咨询量在13天内增长了三倍。

**核心观点：**
尽管Kpods成瘾给Rose及其儿子Ben带来了严重的暴力和情感创伤，但在法律收紧和母亲坚定的支持下，Ben正踏上漫长的康复之路，但母子间的情感修复仍需等待Ben的真诚道歉。

** overarching Framework: **
电子烟毒品成瘾的家庭悲剧、康复挑战与社会干预。

‘I need him to apologise,’ says mum whose son attacked her while high on Kpods For almost a year, a mother had to cope with her son’s addiction to Kpods. His Kpod problem got to a point where he even hit her on one occasion. She’s now helping him through his rehabilitation journey. Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox Rose said her son Ben’s medical bills came up to more than $8,000, which MediSave and MediShield Life covered. ST PHOTO: SHINTARO TAY Claudia Tan Follow topic: Vaping/E-cigarettes Summary Summary Rose's son, Ben, became addicted to etomidate-laced vapes, leading to violence and a strained relationship. She sought a PPO after a physical altercation in November 2024. Ben's addiction caused health issues and a suicide attempt. Rose's efforts to get him help, coupled with stricter laws, led to rehab. Etomidate was reclassified as a Class C drug on Sept 1. Ben is now in recovery, attending counselling and support groups. While Rose is relieved, she awaits his apology for his actions; Ben plans to apologise upon full recovery. AI generated Published Oct 12, 2025, 05:00 AM Updated Oct 12, 2025, 05:31 AM SINGAPORE – She was close to her only child, a 27-year-old son, but his addiction to etomidate-laced vaporisers, or Kpods, damaged the relationship. It got to a point where her son physically hurt her once when he was high and struggled with withdrawal. Rose (not her real name), 56, then applied for a personal protection order against Ben (not his real name) because as a single parent with little family support, she was fearful that he would hurt her badly. At the height of his addiction, Ben was using up to three pods a day. In November 2024, he attempted to harm himself by climbing out of the window in the living room of their HDB flat, which is on a high floor. When his mother tried to stop him, he yelled at her, choked her and slammed her head against a wall. Rose had to call the police on him for this and another incident. After his second arrest, Ben was admitted to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for suicide ideation, and stayed there for two weeks. It was then that he decided to undergo rehabilitation . He was discharged on Sept 3, 2025. Speaking to The Sunday Times at her home in Telok Blangah on Oct 1, Rose said she first learnt Ben was using Kpods in October 2024. “I noticed he wasn’t behaving normally. He was shaking, talking nonsense and smiling. I didn’t know what the problem was, but I suspected it was drug-related,” she said. Rose later found out that her nephew’s girlfriend had introduced Kpods to Ben, who began using the drug to manage the stress he was experiencing while working at a bubble tea shop. “That was when all hell broke loose for me. I saw how he behaved through the CCTV in my house. He couldn’t stand properly, he lost control of his (bowels), and he wouldn’t answer when I spoke to him.” More on this topic ‘I was a Kpod addict’: Journey through addiction and back ‘My son is going crazy’: Mum calls police on vaping 15-year-old, who gets sent to Boys’ Home Ben also started losing his hair, lost a lot of weight, and developed acne-like bumps on his face and legs. On Nov 19 that year , Rose confronted Ben about his Kpod use . Agitated, Ben dashed towards their living room window and tried to jump, but Rose pulled him back. He then slammed her head against a wall. She showed ST the CCTV footage of the incident. As the scuffle continued outside their home, Rose pleaded for her neighbours to call the police. Ben was arrested that evening. After she bailed him out , she lived in fear the following days and months. “I had to hide my wallet in case he stole my money to buy Kpods. I had to lock myself in my room. After two or three months, I decided to apply for a personal protection order against him,” said Rose, who is currently between jobs. After the incident, Ben tried to quit his addiction, but relapsed several times. Things came to a head again on July 31, 2025, when Rose confiscated Ben’s vape and locked him out of the flat, hoping it would help him sober up. High on Kpods, Ben climbed the parapet outside the flat and tried to enter through the window when he realised he had been locked out. Rose called the police again. She said: “I felt hopeless because (it seemed like) no authority could help me. When I saw that etomidate would be reclassified as a Class C drug after his second arrest, I saw a glimpse of hope. “I told myself, this is it. This is the only chance I have to save my son. I had to be firm when he was arrested and not let him come home. When he agreed to go for rehab, I was overjoyed.” Rose was close to her only child, Ben, but his addiction to etomidate-laced vaporisers, or Kpods, damaged the relationship. ST PHOTO: SHINTARO TAY On Aug 17, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced during his National Day Rally speech that the Government would treat vaping as a drug issue . On Sept 1, etomidate was classified as a Class C drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Harsher punishments for Kpod abusers have also been introduced. First-time Kpod abusers under 18 will be fined $500, while those above 18 will be fined $700. They will also be required to attend rehabilitation for up to six months. Rehabilitation Ben was arrested and admitted to IMH for two weeks, as Rose did not want him to be discharged unless he was clean. It was during this time that Ben finally agreed to get help at the National Addictions Management Service (Nams), a facility inside IMH that provides treatment and support for people with addictions. He told ST: “I wanted to go to rehab because I wanted my life back. I wanted to be able to earn money, and spend that money on things that I need or want, not things that would hurt my health.” During his three-week stay at Nams, Ben had counselling sessions and attended programmes teaching him to manage his addiction and regulate his emotions. He also attended support groups where he heard others share their experience with addiction, and participated in activities including gardening, sports, and art and craft. After his discharge from Nams, Ben has been attending group sessions at We Care Community Services , an addiction recovery centre . To prevent a relapse, he deleted the Telegram app from his phone and has cut off contact with his friends who use Kpods. He said: “Now that I am discharged and away from Kpods, I am happy. I don’t keep track of the days (I am clean), I take it one day at a time.” More on this topic No criminal records for young vape users who turn themselves in, turned in by parents: Ong Ye Kung Forcing people into drug treatment can save their lives Rose said her son’s medical bills came up to more than $8,000, which MediSave and MediShield Life covered. Senior consultant psychiatrist Munidasa Winslow from Promises Healthcare made a distinction between recovery and abstinence. “People tend to think that they’re not really addicted, and they can stop any time they want to. “With vapes, a lot of it is behavioural monitoring, which is learning to change your behaviours, and learning alternative behaviours when you have a craving,” he said. “Recovery is an active process, where you’re thinking about why you’re doing (Kpods), and what are the alternatives (to it). People can choose to abstain from things like drugs and alcohol, but if they do not address the issues in their life which cause them to use, they are likely to go back.” About a month after harsher penalties against vaping kicked in, the Ministry of Health and the Health Sciences Authority said 39 people who were caught for using etomidate e-vaporisers had started or were beginning their rehabilitation at IMH or social service agencies. Those ordered to go for mandatory rehabilitation have to attend weekly individual counselling and group support sessions, and take medical tests at Nams. IMH received over 60 inquiries about its vaping cessation programme within 13 days of the announcement of stricter penalties on Aug 28. This is triple the number of inquiries it received between July 1 and Aug 27. There are currently five agencies under the Government’s QuitVape programme: IMH, We Care Community Services, Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association, Thye Hua Kwan Moral Charities and Fei Yue Community Services. ‘I need him to apologise’ Rose said her son’s Kpod addiction has also taken a toll on her mental health, and she was forced to quit her secretary job at a hospital. Although she is relieved that Ben is in recovery, Rose said she has not forgiven him for what he did, as he has yet to apologise. “I need him to apologise because it’s very difficult to experience something like that as a mother. I really thought I was going to die (that day when he slammed my head against the wall). “Other people have told me I am very strong, but I think I was pushed to do what I did. It was a very natural reaction (to save him),” she said. In response, Ben said he wants to make sure he is fully recovered first: “I want to apologise, but I want to get to a point where I can genuinely say I am sorry for what I did and the trouble I’ve caused.” He added: “I think the most important thing for me now is to take things one day at a time, and in time I will apologise to her for what I did.” Helplines Mental well-being National helpline: 1771 (24 hours) / 6669-1771 (via WhatsApp) Samaritans of Singapore: 1-767 (24 hours) / 9151-1767 (24 hours CareText via WhatsApp) Singapore Association for Mental Health: 1800-283-7019 Silver Ribbon Singapore: 6386-1928 Chat, Centre of Excellence for Youth Mental Health: 6493-6500/1 Women’s Helpline (Aware): 1800-777-5555 (weekdays, 10am to 6pm) The Seniors Helpline: 1800-555-5555 (weekdays, 9am to 5pm) Tinkle Friend (for primary school-age children): 1800-2744-788 Counselling Touchline (Counselling): 1800-377-2252 Touch Care Line (for caregivers): 6804-6555 Counselling and Care Centre: 6536-6366 We Care Community Services: 3165-8017 Shan You Counselling Centre: 6741-9293 Clarity Singapore: 6757-7990 Online resources mindline.sg/fsmh eC2.sg chat.mentalhealth.sg carey.carecorner.org.sg (for those aged 13 to 25) limitless.sg/talk (for those aged 12 to 25) shanyou.org.sg Claudia Tan is a journalist at The Straits Times covering the crime and court desk.
