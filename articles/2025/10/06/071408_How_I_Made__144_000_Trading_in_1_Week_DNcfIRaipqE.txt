 Finally that time again, I'm hosting another in-person bootcamp where I'll be teaching you exactly how I trade every single day and not only that, you'll be sitting right beside me every single morning to trade with me. The student that we had just a couple months ago in person is already making six figures. This month alone, he's up $365,000 shout out to Brock. I'm extremely proud of you and he's not just one student that's doing great. We have multiple students doing great. So if you were ever wondering when I was going to do another in-person bootcamp, you've seen it on my YouTube, you've seen it in my stories, you've seen it on Instagram. This is the time in October, I will put it right here on the screen. It will be in New York and it will be the best one yet. My final in-person bootcamp this year, I do not do this often maybe two or three times a year, but this one will be the biggest. If you were wondering, I'll see you guys there. What's going on guys? Welcome back to another special video. It was an insane week and if you follow me on any of my platforms, you know, I had a crazy, crazy week. I made $144,000 this week. And just for October, since October is the only the last three days, in September, was the first two days of this week. October alone, I made $105,000. So beautiful start to my month, beautiful start to my quarter, technically beautiful, just a beautiful end to this week, especially on Friday. I almost gave back some and we'll talk about that, but I want to do a live login, show you guys how much I made because a lot of people just come on here and tell you how much they made, no proof to any of that. And I really, really do despise those videos. So I'm going to show you guys a live login here. So if we click here, MooMoo, obviously I'm going to blur my number out because we don't need to do that. The code is four, seven, three, beautiful. All right, so logging into my MooMoo account, which is a broker owned by FuToo, which is a public company on the stock market. So it's just like another platform. I know a lot of you are using it because of me. A lot of people are using platform as their backup. This is my platform that I use every single day. So as you can see, the last five days alone, this is my P&L. Now if I go to P&L calendar, you'll see for October alone, I made $105,319. As you can see, the last three days, $33,000, $40,000, $31,000. At one point on the third, which was Friday, I was read about, I want to say at least 50,000. Because at that point, I'm looking to go for my record. If you guys don't know my record, my record's $860,000 for the month. That's just day trading. So keep that in mind. Now if I show you guys this and we'll do a custom, so what day is it? So we go this way, then we'll go to here. You'll see that this week alone, I made $144,220. I don't know why this looks like this. Looks weird. But I always keep my account around that $100,000 mark just favorably. That's just where I feel the most comfortable. Sometimes though, when I'm having this type of month, I'll let my account hold a lot more. Now obviously I've separate accounts that hold more just because I ever need it. I'll transfer from other accounts into this account. But anyways, long story short, this week alone, $144,220. And then for the month of October, which is only the last three days of this week, because the first two is September, I made $105,319. Now how did you do it, Nor? How is that possible? What was going on? Well, let's talk about it. So I showed you guys my live login. Let's make this chart big. So what did I catch this week? What made this week so special? Why did I make so much versus my average week? You have to remember my average week, I would say is around, I would say around 60,000, I want to say, when I'm having just an average week. So for me to make $144, which is a little bit more than double, that's an insane week to me. So everybody has their big week and their own definition of a big week. Someone's big week could be a million dollars and someone's can look at this and say, this is not even a big week for me. Everybody has their own perspective on a big week versus little week. Anyways, let's take a look at this together. And we'll look at the last couple of days. So let's take a look at September 29th, which was Monday. This is how Tesla started off, right? There was nothing much on Tesla here. What I did catch on Tesla on Monday was this opening push here at market opening. We dropped and then we pushed right into that 450. I caught that. And if I do go to my account, what did I make that day? Oh, Monday, I messed it up. I only made $2,000 that day. So I did a little too much on Monday because of this. And you know how we only broke by 98 cents? I looked to hold more. And obviously, I didn't work in my favor because I peeked there. I made a post on Instagram and I talked about how I was up nicely for the day and I woke up thinking it was going to be a big day. And then I ended up only making $2,000 because it was just a back and forth day. And it just the type of move that I wanted was not there. So I talked about on Instagram talking about how when you wake up and expect a big move and you don't get it, that doesn't mean chase it for the rest of the day because unlike a regular job, you have opportunities every single day in the market. It's not today, it might be tomorrow. And if it's not tomorrow and it's not this whole week, you still have next week, next month, and the rest of the quarter, right? So we need to stop acting like trading is a job and know how to sit there and not do any work. Now the next day here on Tesla, I ended up taking this to the downside caught a nice move from like 435 down to like 432 and some change. And obviously, you can see we bounced right back up. And then I took opening price to the to the to the hive day, which was 440 break all the way up to maybe like 442.50. So I took one of those trades and ended up clearing what was that? $38,000. So it was nice. I called the downside that day. I caught the upside. That was a cool day was nothing special, but I played it so correctly because I waited for my downside move. And then I waited for my upside move. So both both plays worked on a favor. Now, as you can see, this Wednesday is when things got crazy. So if we head over to October, this day, I made 31,000. Now if you look at 31,000, you look at 38,000, you're like, well, $38,000 were was a bigger day than 31. Why does why are you saying that? It's a type of play. Now, yes, the day before when I made 38,000, it was just a cleaner day, right? Just nice moves, just patience involved. That's why I ended up clearing that. But this day, you could see we took that 445 level broke into 450. And I absolutely cleared that. I played that perfectly. I end up clearing $31,000. So that was a smooth day. That's something you guys can easily catch. And probably we're looking at the same level. You guys probably played that 450 break. So we were all on the same page. Now let's look at Thursday. This is where things got fun. I made $40,000 on Thursday. So let's take a look at Thursday. You could see overnight, this close to at 455, we opened at 470 and hit a height of 479 pre market due to the numbers for sales and the numbers that Tesla releases every quarter. And then we took a sell off. Not that we took the sell off, but Tesla took a nice little sell off right when market opened. So I was all over this, all over this. And I don't need to break down my individual trades, because why I live stream every single day for you guys. So you guys can go to my YouTube, you can go to my Twitch. And all those videos are still saved from when I was day trading and live signaling in the chat. So that's what that's why it's so nice to live stream every day. Because you guys can go back and learn from what I did, where I entered, where I exit. How did I signal to the chat? Those are the cool things about why live stream is cool. Now there is a five-minute delay on live streaming, but that's for a reason because I have a discord. And it wouldn't make sense if I made the live stream no delay. So live stream is for you guys to see what I'm doing every day, learn from it, recap from it. And then the discord is for people who are actually sitting there trading alongside with me listening to me and all that good stuff. But you could see this stock went from 470 to four, what, 25 that day. So that 40,000. Wait, where is this? That 40,000 that I made that Thursday was really nothing in comparison to that to the day we had on Tesla compared to my other days. It's just the opportunity I got took advantage. And I was like, I'm done. And then Friday, same thing. I took the low here at 435. Where is this? 435 here. And I took it down to the downside, another day to downside. Then I took 430. And I was just taking trades over and over to the downside. You know what's funny? Why I started off by morning like that? I was up 20,000 on my signal. I told the chat I was selling. And I went to go sell for a limit order. Didn't fail. If you guys go watch the live stream, you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. And that's why I started my morning off. I was up 20,000 ended up selling a trade for negative 20,000. Start off by morning like that on a Friday after I'm having a big week is never the ideal situation for me. Anyways, ended up working my ass off. Excuse my language to make my money back. And obviously you don't need to make your money back. But I was taking things slowly. You know, I don't want to go for bigger trades just because I'm down a bigger number and all that good stuff. So I had to sit there be patient. And when I was signaling, I was making sure I wasn't being biased to the situation of me of what I'm in currently. And I was down. So when I saw that 12,000 on the first trade, I went to go sell. When I saw that was up 15,000, I went to go sell. So those are the things you have to focus on because you start getting biased when you start off red because you're going to look to try to recover every single penny. Luckily, it did work out of my favor. And when I say luckily, I mean, obviously it's not luck. But luckily, in my favor, I stuck to discipline. I stuck to what I know best. And that's how to trade. And I stuck to patients, right? Some days you can slip up even nine years into the game. It's been, I started in 2016 to 2025. So it'll be 10 years in the summer of 2026. Those are the things you need to follow as a trader. And luckily, sometimes you slip up. But luckily, I did not slip up, especially on a week like this, where I really got to prosper and enjoy my complete week of excellence in the market. So that is my week in the stock market. This is more of a live log in showing you that this is actually made and not like these other traders online because they're all fake. But also to educate you on my live streams that have five minute delays, those are things to take advantage of. And obviously, if you're in the discord, but live streams are free. Come to the live streams, you'll learn, recap, see what Nora's taking. Maybe you can't take you obviously, you can't take them with me because it's a delay, but you can at least learn from it. So hope you guys enjoyed this video. Hit that like button, subscribe, and I'll see you guys next week.
