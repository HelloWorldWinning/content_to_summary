### **核心观点与结构化摘要**

#### **Anthropic Claude 生态系统全方位功能升级**

本次更新围绕 Claude 的核心交互、桌面端应用、网页端编码、安全性和扩展性进行了一系列重大升级，旨在将其打造为更强大、更集成、更安全的 AI 助手和开发伙伴。

1.  **核心交互增强：更智能的主动性**
    *   **主动澄清 (Proactive Clarifications):** Claude 现在能够主动向用户提问，以获取完成任务所需的额外信息或澄清模糊指令，提升了交互的准确性和效率。

2.  **Claude Desktop 桌面端：与操作系统的无缝集成**
    *   **正式发布 (Generally Available):** 桌面应用现已正式可用，可通过菜单栏或快捷键（macOS 上连按两次 Option 键）快速访问。
    *   **屏幕截图分析:** 用户可以直接拖拽选取屏幕上的任何区域，将其发送给 Claude 进行分析和解释，实现了强大的视觉理解能力。
    *   **语音转录 (Talk to Claude):** 通过按下 `Caps Lock` 键即可激活语音输入，将语音实时转录为文本。

3.  **Claude Code 网页版：云端异步编码代理**
    *   **网页端访问:** 用户现在可以直接在网页上使用 Claude Code，类似于其他在线编码助手。
    *   **异步代理任务:** 可以在网页界面上分配编码任务（如创建网站），Claude Code 会作为异步代理在后台工作，并最终为用户创建 GitHub PR (Pull Request)。

4.  **安全框架升级：沙盒模式 (Sandbox)**
    *   **解决安全风险:** 针对直接执行操作（YOLO 模式）可能带来的系统风险，推出了沙盒环境。
    *   **限制操作范围:** 沙盒将 Claude 的所有文件操作和命令执行限制在指定的项目文件夹内，防止对系统造成意外更改。
    *   **提升用户体验:** 在保证安全的前提下，大幅减少了不必要的权限确认弹窗（减少了 84%）。
    *   **运行时开源:** Anthropic 已将沙盒的运行时环境开源，供其他开发者构建自己的安全 AI 代理。

5.  **扩展能力：Claude 技能 (Skills)**
    *   **技能创建与集成:** 用户可以利用内置的 “Skill Creator” 工具，上传文档（如 ADK 文档）来创建自定义技能。
    *   **在项目中使用:** 将创建好的技能文件夹放入项目目录后，即可在与 Claude Code 的交互中直接调用该技能，使其具备特定领域的专业知识和能力。

### **核心结论**

Anthropic通过一系列涵盖交互智能、桌面集成、网页端编码、安全沙盒和可扩展技能的重大更新，将Claude打造为一个更强大、更安全、更无缝集成的AI开发与协作平台。

### ** overarching framework**

该内容的 overarching framework 是展示一个先进的AI助手（Claude）如何通过 **“多平台扩展（桌面端、网页端）、增强交互智能（主动提问、视觉与语音）、强化安全保障（沙盒）以及深化专业能力（技能系统）”** 这四大支柱，从一个对话工具演进为一个全方位、深度集成于用户工作流的智能开发与协作伙伴。

You can also access it, in your menu bar. You can also access it, in your menu bar. You can also access it, through a shortcut which is tapping, through a shortcut which is tapping, through a shortcut which is tapping, options twice on MacOSS. So that brings, options twice on MacOSS. So that brings, options twice on MacOSS. So that brings, up a quick view of Cloud Desktop. But, up a quick view of Cloud Desktop. But, up a quick view of Cloud Desktop. But, here's the neat feature. You can, here's the neat feature. You can, here's the neat feature. You can, actually just drag and select an area, actually just drag and select an area, actually just drag and select an area, that is going to be sent to Cloud, that is going to be sent to Cloud, that is going to be sent to Cloud, Desktop and then we can tell it to do, Desktop and then we can tell it to do, Desktop and then we can tell it to do, something. Can you analyze what is in, something. Can you analyze what is in, something. Can you analyze what is in, these images and explain those to me?, these images and explain those to me?, these images and explain those to me?, Which is actually pretty neat, Which is actually pretty neat, Which is actually pretty neat, especially if you want to use claude as, especially if you want to use claude as, especially if you want to use claude as, a helpful assistant. Now, it can see, a helpful assistant. Now, it can see, a helpful assistant. Now, it can see, your desktop. But there is also another, your desktop. But there is also another, your desktop.

So, let me, very weird implementation. So, let me, very weird implementation. So, let me, show you that. This next one is talk to, show you that. This next one is talk to, show you that. This next one is talk to, clone. So you can trigger talk to clone, clone. So you can trigger talk to clone, clone. So you can trigger talk to clone, just by pressing the caps lock button, just by pressing the caps lock button, just by pressing the caps lock button, which was a very weird choice. Here is, which was a very weird choice. Here is, which was a very weird choice. Here is, how it looks like. Now if you start, how it looks like. Now if you start, how it looks like. Now if you start, talking Claude is going to transcribe, talking Claude is going to transcribe, talking Claude is going to transcribe, the text and then if you press on caps, the text and then if you press on caps, the text and then if you press on caps, lock again it will stop transcribing., lock again it will stop transcribing., lock again it will stop transcribing., Okay. So this is pretty neat. Although I, Okay. So this is pretty neat. Although I, Okay. So this is pretty neat. Although I, think it did not capture the whole, think it did not capture the whole, think it did not capture the whole, thing. But here's the weird part. Now, thing. But here's the weird part. Now, thing. But here's the weird part. Now, if I'm here and I press caps locks, if I'm here and I press caps locks, if I'm here and I press caps locks, again, it doesn't do anything, right?, again, it doesn't do anything, right?, again, it doesn't do anything, right?, So, it's a very weird experience. Now, I, So, it's a very weird experience. Now, I, So, it's a very weird experience. Now, I, have a much better option for you. You, have a much better option for you. You, have a much better option for you. You, can actually use my application that I'm, can actually use my application that I'm, can actually use my application that I'm, calling, right? So, this gives you the, calling, right? So, this gives you the, calling, right? So, this gives you the, ability to transcribe your speech into, ability to transcribe your speech into, ability to transcribe your speech into, any text box. There are a number of, any text box. There are a number of, any text box. There are a number of, different short keys. It's not caps, different short keys. It's not caps, different short keys. It's not caps, lock. So, let's bring up cloud desktop, lock. So, let's bring up cloud desktop, lock. So, let's bring up cloud desktop, again. And now we're going to press the, again. And now we're going to press the, again. And now we're going to press the, short keys. I capture this image and now, short keys. I capture this image and now, short keys. I capture this image and now, I can trigger this app, perform image, I can trigger this app, perform image, I can trigger this app, perform image, analysis and explain what exactly you, analysis and explain what exactly you, analysis and explain what exactly you, see here. Now the beauty is it's, see here. Now the beauty is it's, see here. Now the beauty is it's, extremely fast and it works in any text, extremely fast and it works in any text, extremely fast and it works in any text, window inside the Mac OS. Details are, window inside the Mac OS. Details are, window inside the Mac OS. Details are, going to be in the video description if, going to be in the video description if, going to be in the video description if, you are interested in this app. It's a, you are interested in this app. It's a, you are interested in this app. It's a, perfect companion for wbe coding or, perfect companion for wbe coding or, perfect companion for wbe coding or, writing purposes and it's going to save, writing purposes and it's going to save, writing purposes and it's going to save, you so much time. I use it daily. This, you so much time. I use it daily. This, you so much time. I use it daily. This, next feature is something that a lot of, next feature is something that a lot of, next feature is something that a lot of, people have been asking for and that's, people have been asking for and that's, people have been asking for and that's, the ability to use cloud code on the, the ability to use cloud code on the, the ability to use cloud code on the, web. Very similar to codeex where you, web. Very similar to codeex where you, web. Very similar to codeex where you, have a version that you can use on the, have a version that you can use on the, have a version that you can use on the, web and you also have the codec cla., web and you also have the codec cla., web and you also have the codec cla., Now, cloud code also gives you the, Now, cloud code also gives you the, Now, cloud code also gives you the, ability to continue working on this web, ability to continue working on this web, ability to continue working on this web, interface where you can assign the agent, interface where you can assign the agent, interface where you can assign the agent, a task and then it's going to create a, a task and then it's going to create a, a task and then it's going to create a, PR for you. So, let me show you how this, PR for you. So, let me show you how this, PR for you. So, let me show you how this, works. So, here is the claw code version, works. So, here is the claw code version, works. So, here is the claw code version, of this asynchronous agent. Now, you'll, of this asynchronous agent. Now, you'll, of this asynchronous agent. Now, you'll, have to connect your GitHub account. You, have to connect your GitHub account. You, have to connect your GitHub account. You, can see that it already completed a task, can see that it already completed a task, can see that it already completed a task, for me. So, it's ready to create a PR., for me. So, it's ready to create a PR., for me. So, it's ready to create a PR., But let me walk you through what the, But let me walk you through what the, But let me walk you through what the, flow actually looks like. Okay. So we're, flow actually looks like. Okay. So we're, flow actually looks like. Okay. So we're, going to provide a very detailed prompt, going to provide a very detailed prompt, going to provide a very detailed prompt, on what exactly I want this to look, on what exactly I want this to look, on what exactly I want this to look, like. Now in here you can use, like. Now in here you can use, like. Now in here you can use, environment variable. So if you want to, environment variable. So if you want to, environment variable. So if you want to, set any API keys you can set them here., set any API keys you can set them here., set any API keys you can set them here., And you can also define the network, And you can also define the network, And you can also define the network, access. So whether you want to use it on, access. So whether you want to use it on, access. So whether you want to use it on, trusted network access, no network, trusted network access, no network, trusted network access, no network, access at all or custom access. Right?, access at all or custom access. Right?, access at all or custom access. Right?, In this case, I don't really need any, In this case, I don't really need any, In this case, I don't really need any, environment variables or any API keys. I, environment variables or any API keys. I, environment variables or any API keys. I, already created new repo for this. We're, already created new repo for this. We're, already created new repo for this. We're, going to just send that in and cloud, going to just send that in and cloud, going to just send that in and cloud, code is going to start working. So, in, code is going to start working. So, in, code is going to start working. So, in, this case, I just wanted to create a, this case, I just wanted to create a, this case, I just wanted to create a, website for one of the apps. Now, you, website for one of the apps. Now, you, website for one of the apps. Now, you, can run multiple asynchronous agents., can run multiple asynchronous agents., can run multiple asynchronous agents., So, you can potentially create yet, So, you can potentially create yet, So, you can potentially create yet, another task for cloud code and it's, another task for cloud code and it's, another task for cloud code and it's, going to continue working on it. Okay., going to continue working on it. Okay., going to continue working on it. Okay., For some reason, I'm having a lot of, For some reason, I'm having a lot of, For some reason, I'm having a lot of, connection issues right now. I had to, connection issues right now. I had to, connection issues right now. I had to, actually archive one of the previous, actually archive one of the previous, actually archive one of the previous, attempt, but it did work in one of my, attempt, but it did work in one of my, attempt, but it did work in one of my, previous request. So, this might be, previous request. So, this might be, previous request. So, this might be, something related to the network right, something related to the network right, something related to the network right, now. Now, moving on. Now, cloud code is, now. Now, moving on. Now, cloud code is, now. Now, moving on. Now, cloud code is, pretty awesome, but it can be pretty, pretty awesome, but it can be pretty, pretty awesome, but it can be pretty, expensive to run it. So, people have, expensive to run it. So, people have, expensive to run it. So, people have, been trying openweight models and one of, been trying openweight models and one of, been trying openweight models and one of, my favorite is Kim K2. not only its, my favorite is Kim K2. not only its, my favorite is Kim K2. not only its, state-of-the-art model, but it actually, state-of-the-art model, but it actually, state-of-the-art model, but it actually, has a personality which is very pleasing, has a personality which is very pleasing, has a personality which is very pleasing, to talk to. So, I was really excited, to talk to. So, I was really excited, to talk to. So, I was really excited, when they reached out to sponsor this, when they reached out to sponsor this, when they reached out to sponsor this, video. It's a free alternative to, video. It's a free alternative to, video. It's a free alternative to, something like Chart TPD, but they also, something like Chart TPD, but they also, something like Chart TPD, but they also, recently released their agent mode which, recently released their agent mode which, recently released their agent mode which, they're calling okay computer. So, think, they're calling okay computer. So, think, they're calling okay computer. So, think, of this deep research meets image, of this deep research meets image, of this deep research meets image, generation meets lovable. From a single, generation meets lovable. From a single, generation meets lovable. From a single, prompt, you can create working web pages, prompt, you can create working web pages, prompt, you can create working web pages, and web apps. So, let me show you a, and web apps. So, let me show you a, and web apps. So, let me show you a, quick demo of this in action. So, here, quick demo of this in action. So, here, quick demo of this in action. So, here, we select okay computer. I'm going to, we select okay computer. I'm going to, we select okay computer. I'm going to, provide a very detailed prompt and let's, provide a very detailed prompt and let's, provide a very detailed prompt and let's, send this in. It sets up a virtual, send this in. It sets up a virtual, send this in. It sets up a virtual, machine and then start thinking about, machine and then start thinking about, machine and then start thinking about, the specs. It creates tasks for itself, the specs. It creates tasks for itself, the specs. It creates tasks for itself, and then goes working. So here's the, and then goes working. So here's the, and then goes working. So here's the, website that it created and there is a, website that it created and there is a, website that it created and there is a, real working link to it. Seems like, real working link to it. Seems like, real working link to it. Seems like, pretty neat and actually usable. So do, pretty neat and actually usable. So do, pretty neat and actually usable. So do, check it out. You get to try it for, check it out. You get to try it for, check it out. You get to try it for, free. Link is going to be in the video, free. Link is going to be in the video, free. Link is going to be in the video, description. Now back to the video. If, description. Now back to the video. If, description. Now back to the video. If, you're using cloud code in the normal, you're using cloud code in the normal, you're using cloud code in the normal, mode, it will keep asking you for your, mode, it will keep asking you for your, mode, it will keep asking you for your, permissions before it performs certain, permissions before it performs certain, permissions before it performs certain, operations, which is usually pretty, operations, which is usually pretty, operations, which is usually pretty, great, but can be extremely annoying., great, but can be extremely annoying., great, but can be extremely annoying., Now, on the other hand, if you're, Now, on the other hand, if you're, Now, on the other hand, if you're, feeling adventurous, you can actually, feeling adventurous, you can actually, feeling adventurous, you can actually, use the yolo mode or skip permissions, use the yolo mode or skip permissions, use the yolo mode or skip permissions, dangerously. But this can perform some, dangerously. But this can perform some, dangerously. But this can perform some, weird operations on your system. That's, weird operations on your system. That's, weird operations on your system. That's, why claude just introduced something, why claude just introduced something, why claude just introduced something, called sandbox which actually sandbox is, called sandbox which actually sandbox is, called sandbox which actually sandbox is, the operations that it's going to, the operations that it's going to, the operations that it's going to, perform and you can limit where it can, perform and you can limit where it can, perform and you can limit where it can, do those operations. So for example if, do those operations. So for example if, do those operations. So for example if, you go to / sandbox right now we are in, you go to / sandbox right now we are in, you go to / sandbox right now we are in, no sandbox that means any operation, no sandbox that means any operation, no sandbox that means any operation, performed by claude can be outside the, performed by claude can be outside the, performed by claude can be outside the, scope of the current folder and it can, scope of the current folder and it can, scope of the current folder and it can, do system level operations because we, do system level operations because we, do system level operations because we, are in the yolo mode. But with sandbox, are in the yolo mode. But with sandbox, are in the yolo mode. But with sandbox, you can limit all the operation that are, you can limit all the operation that are, you can limit all the operation that are, going to be performed to a current, going to be performed to a current, going to be performed to a current, folder or set of folders and files., folder or set of folders and files., folder or set of folders and files., Right? There are two different options., Right? There are two different options., Right? There are two different options., One is sandbox patch tool with auto, One is sandbox patch tool with auto, One is sandbox patch tool with auto, allow in accept edit modes and then the, allow in accept edit modes and then the, allow in accept edit modes and then the, other one is sandbox with regular, other one is sandbox with regular, other one is sandbox with regular, permissions. So if you click on this is, permissions. So if you click on this is, permissions. So if you click on this is, going to basically sandbox all of the, going to basically sandbox all of the, going to basically sandbox all of the, operations to this specific folder but, operations to this specific folder but, operations to this specific folder but, it's going to still ask you for, it's going to still ask you for, it's going to still ask you for, permissions when it's doing an, permissions when it's doing an, permissions when it's doing an, operation. Now this means that every, operation. Now this means that every, operation. Now this means that every, cloud code instance is going to ship, cloud code instance is going to ship, cloud code instance is going to ship, with a sandbox that is going to be, with a sandbox that is going to be, with a sandbox that is going to be, running on your machine. So here's the, running on your machine. So here's the, running on your machine. So here's the, overall architecture. You have the user, overall architecture. You have the user, overall architecture. You have the user, interactions cloud code and then that, interactions cloud code and then that, interactions cloud code and then that, sandbox environment in which is, sandbox environment in which is, sandbox environment in which is, performing all the operations. In fact, performing all the operations. In fact, performing all the operations. In fact, the cloud code web version is a sandbox, the cloud code web version is a sandbox, the cloud code web version is a sandbox, environment that tropic is running on, environment that tropic is running on, environment that tropic is running on, their own servers and in that case your, their own servers and in that case your, their own servers and in that case your, GitHub credentials are actually outside, GitHub credentials are actually outside, GitHub credentials are actually outside, of the sandbox environment. Now the good, of the sandbox environment. Now the good, of the sandbox environment. Now the good, news is that they opensource the, news is that they opensource the, news is that they opensource the, anthropic sandbox runtime environment., anthropic sandbox runtime environment., anthropic sandbox runtime environment., So if you are building agents that needs, So if you are building agents that needs, So if you are building agents that needs, a sandbox, you can build on top of this., a sandbox, you can build on top of this., a sandbox, you can build on top of this., I highly recommend to check this out., I highly recommend to check this out., I highly recommend to check this out., And this actually solves a real problem, And this actually solves a real problem, And this actually solves a real problem, in terms of managing the access of the, in terms of managing the access of the, in terms of managing the access of the, agent to the system. And according to, agent to the system. And according to, agent to the system. And according to, their own research, they found that, their own research, they found that, their own research, they found that, sandboxing safely reduces permission, sandboxing safely reduces permission, sandboxing safely reduces permission, prompts by 84%. They can be annoying at, prompts by 84%. They can be annoying at, prompts by 84%. They can be annoying at, times. So I highly recommend to check, times. So I highly recommend to check, times. So I highly recommend to check, out this feature as well. Claude can now, out this feature as well. Claude can now, out this feature as well. Claude can now, proactively ask you questions if it, proactively ask you questions if it, proactively ask you questions if it, needs certain clarifications. So here's, needs certain clarifications. So here's, needs certain clarifications. So here's, a quick example. Now in this case I, a quick example. Now in this case I, a quick example. Now in this case I, specifically told it to ask me, specifically told it to ask me, specifically told it to ask me, clarifying questions. It can do it by, clarifying questions. It can do it by, clarifying questions. It can do it by, itself now. So for example I want to, itself now. So for example I want to, itself now. So for example I want to, implement a new feature in my speech, implement a new feature in my speech, implement a new feature in my speech, transcription app. I can select the, transcription app. I can select the, transcription app. I can select the, answers to the different questions right, answers to the different questions right, answers to the different questions right, and that's the issue right and then you, and that's the issue right and then you, and that's the issue right and then you, can submit. It doesn't happen often but, can submit. It doesn't happen often but, can submit. It doesn't happen often but, if it needs clarification it will, if it needs clarification it will, if it needs clarification it will, proactively asks you. Something that I, proactively asks you. Something that I, proactively asks you. Something that I, used to do was whenever I provide a, used to do was whenever I provide a, used to do was whenever I provide a, prompt, I would actually ask the LLM to, prompt, I would actually ask the LLM to, prompt, I would actually ask the LLM to, ask for clarification if it needs any., ask for clarification if it needs any., ask for clarification if it needs any., But now with this, it's pretty awesome, But now with this, it's pretty awesome, But now with this, it's pretty awesome, and the questions that it asks are, and the questions that it asks are, and the questions that it asks are, extremely relevant and well thought out., extremely relevant and well thought out., extremely relevant and well thought out., But as a user, you don't really have, But as a user, you don't really have, But as a user, you don't really have, control on it. It will proactively asks, control on it. It will proactively asks, control on it. It will proactively asks, you. The last thing we are going to look, you. The last thing we are going to look, you. The last thing we are going to look, at is cloud skills that you can now, at is cloud skills that you can now, at is cloud skills that you can now, directly use within cloud code. I, directly use within cloud code. I, directly use within cloud code. I, previously created a dedicated video on, previously created a dedicated video on, previously created a dedicated video on, what exactly claude skills are and, what exactly claude skills are and, what exactly claude skills are and, there's also a video coming out on how, there's also a video coming out on how, there's also a video coming out on how, to use them directly within cloud code., to use them directly within cloud code., to use them directly within cloud code., Link to that is going to be in the video, Link to that is going to be in the video, Link to that is going to be in the video, description. If you go to capabilities, description. If you go to capabilities, description. If you go to capabilities, within the cloud desktop or the web, within the cloud desktop or the web, within the cloud desktop or the web, version, you can see there is a skill, version, you can see there is a skill, version, you can see there is a skill, called skill creator. You can use this, called skill creator. You can use this, called skill creator. You can use this, to create your own skills. So here's an, to create your own skills. So here's an, to create your own skills. So here's an, example. I uploaded all the ADK, example. I uploaded all the ADK, example. I uploaded all the ADK, documentations and just asked claude to, documentations and just asked claude to, documentations and just asked claude to, create a skill for that. So then it, create a skill for that. So then it, create a skill for that. So then it, started using the actual creator skill, started using the actual creator skill, started using the actual creator skill, and created a zip file. All you need to, and created a zip file. All you need to, and created a zip file. All you need to, do is to just download that zip file., do is to just download that zip file., do is to just download that zip file., Then go to the project folder where you, Then go to the project folder where you, Then go to the project folder where you, want to use that skill within the cloud, want to use that skill within the cloud, want to use that skill within the cloud, folder. Create another skills folder and, folder. Create another skills folder and, folder. Create another skills folder and, just copy the skill folder there. And if, just copy the skill folder there. And if, just copy the skill folder there. And if, you want to use it, here's what you're, you want to use it, here's what you're, you want to use it, here's what you're, going to do. Can you use the ADK skill, going to do. Can you use the ADK skill, going to do. Can you use the ADK skill, to create a multi- aent system using the, to create a multi- aent system using the, to create a multi- aent system using the, Google agent development kit? This is, Google agent development kit? This is, Google agent development kit? This is, supposed to be a customer support agent., supposed to be a customer support agent., supposed to be a customer support agent., Make sure that it is able to process, Make sure that it is able to process, Make sure that it is able to process, orders, returns, and give the user, orders, returns, and give the user, orders, returns, and give the user, information. Now if we send this in then, information. Now if we send this in then, information. Now if we send this in then, cloud code will be able to just go, cloud code will be able to just go, cloud code will be able to just go, through that skill and use the ADK, through that skill and use the ADK, through that skill and use the ADK, documentation to help us create an, documentation to help us create an, documentation to help us create an, agent. So here it's actually asking us, agent. So here it's actually asking us, agent. So here it's actually asking us, to use the ADK skill. So make sure to, to use the ADK skill. So make sure to, to use the ADK skill. So make sure to, subscribe to the channel to watch the, subscribe to the channel to watch the, subscribe to the channel to watch the, other video that is going to be coming, other video that is going to be coming, other video that is going to be coming, out on creating skills and using them, out on creating skills and using them, out on creating skills and using them, within cloud code. Now anyways I hope, within cloud code. Now anyways I hope, within cloud code. Now anyways I hope, you found this video useful. Thanks for, you found this video useful. Thanks for, you found this video useful. Thanks for, watching and as always, see you in the, watching and as always, see you in the, watching and as always, see you in the, next
