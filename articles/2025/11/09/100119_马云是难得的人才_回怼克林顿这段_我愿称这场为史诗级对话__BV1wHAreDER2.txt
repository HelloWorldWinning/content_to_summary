Description:
好的，这是根据您的要求对文本内容进行的提炼与总结。

### **核心思想纲要**

1.  **外部担忧与内部现实的错位**
    *   **观点**: 外界（尤其是美国）对中国经济的担忧是过度的。
    *   **论据**: 历史证明，每当外界担忧中国时，中国反而发展得更好。这种担忧源于不了解中国国情。

2.  **中美消费模式的根本差异**
    *   **美国模式**: 习惯借贷消费（花明天的钱、别人的钱），经济不景气时消费能力会枯竭。
    *   **中国模式**: 习惯储蓄，是全球储蓄率最高的国家之一。因为经历过贫穷，民众有危机意识，即使经济放缓，依然有储蓄可以支撑消费。

3.  **中国经济模式的根本性转型**
    *   **旧模式 (过去30年)**:
        *   **特点**: 政府主导，强于投资和出口。
        *   **弊端**: 忽视了内需，并导致了严重的环境问题（水、空气污染）。
    *   **新模式 (现在与未来)**:
        *   **特点**: 市场与企业家精神驱动，专注于发展国内消费。
        *   **机遇**: 政府在经济中的强势角色正在减弱，这正是企业家和市场经济的“表演时间”。
        *   **愿景**: 通过扩大进口满足庞大的内需（未来将有10亿中产阶级），从而改善环境，实现更健康的增长。

4.  **对经济增速的全新认知**
    *   **观点**: 不应再追求11%的高速增长，7%甚至5%的增长率是健康的、高质量的。
    *   **比喻**: 中国经济就像一个长到1.8米的成年人，不能再追求身高每年增长10%，而应追求内在质量、思想和智慧的成长。

5.  **对未来的极端乐观：技术与青年是解药**
    *   **核心信念**: 担忧和问题本身就是机遇。
    *   **驱动力**:
        *   **技术**: 数据技术（DT时代）和互联网将为解决环境、能源等难题提供全新方案。
        *   **青年**: 80后等在互联网时代成长起来的年轻人，将用新思维和新方法解决上一代人担忧的问题。

### **核心结论（一句话）**

中国经济的放缓并非危机，而是一次必要的、从旧有的投资出口模式向由内需、企业家精神和数据技术驱动的更健康、可持续新模式的转型，这其中蕴含着巨大的机遇。

---

### **内容的总览框架**

本内容采用了一个 **“危机即机遇”的转型叙事框架**。演讲者首先承认并驳斥了外界对中国经济“泡沫”和“放缓”的担忧，然后通过对比中美消费文化、剖析中国经济增长模式的今昔之变，将当前的经济挑战重新定义为一个从粗放的、依赖出口的旧模式，迈向由内需、市场和技术驱动的、更高质量新模式的战略机遇期。整个论述充满了对企业家精神、市场力量、新科技和年轻一代的乐观信念。

Your country China, there has been a great deal of concern over the bubble. Bad things will happen. I think the, I think the new American people worry too much about the China economy. Well, you see, every time when you start to worry about China, China goes better. You're up and in the United States. There has been a great deal of talk about your country China. There has been a great deal of concern about whether the biggest movement of people out of extreme poverty into the global middle class in history, but done it in a way that overheated the economy leading to the current difficulties with the effort to achieve the Millennium Development Goals which just expired in reducing extreme poverty. And basically what we're finding is when most of us believe this can only be made better by working closer together. So first, I'd like to ask you, given the incredible advances in technology in the last few years, and the likelihood of the pace only accelerating, problems like the current problem in China less likely. That is, if we'll have more market information in the market, we'll drive where the investment goes. There has been a great deal of concern over the bubble. Bad things will happen. I think the last week I was in Seattle discussing about the China economy. I think the new American people worry too much about the China economy. Well, you see, every time when you start to worry about China, China goes better. Every China thinks China is a problem, you know, we've got better. But when you say, you have a high expectation of China, China always a problem. But there's a big difference between American consumption because people say, well, the economy is bad, so China consumption will be good low. No, totally different. You, America, love to spend tomorrow's money. And the other people's money, maybe. Or maybe the cutest money. We Chinese love to save money. We are probably the largest country of the safe deposit in the whole world, because we've been poor for so many years. When we made money, we put in the banks because someday we know the disaster is coming so we can spend the money. So when the economy is bad, we still have the money to spend. You guys probably don't. You worry. And the second thing is that China being, if market, China being focusing on developing for the past 30 years, China government, soul strong on investment, soul strong on exporting. But they are too weak on the domestic consumption. Domestic consumption is not driven by government, it's driven by entrepreneurship. Driven by the market, not the government. So in the past two years, past two to two years, government is soul strong. Now they're going to weak. It's our opportunity. It's our show time. To see the market economy, entrepreneurship, how we can develop the real consumption. I think if the China developed the great consumption, we have a 300 million middle class. In the next 15 to 20 years, we're going to have a billion middle class. We need to import a lot. So when we start to import, that's great. I worry a lot when we export. When we export, we got a terrible sky, we have a terrible water, we have a terrible environment. When we start to import, we got to be better. So that's all the great opportunity. Guys, be happy about that. I'm serious. I agree with that. I'm serious. Worry by yourself, don't worry about that. The reason some of us worry about China is we depend on you to buy our debt. However, I tried to be more Chinese when I was president. I saved a lot of money. Good. I really believe that. I mean, I think you're absolutely right. The trend toward greater internal consumption is, I think, will remain unbroken in spite of whatever the difficulties are in the next few months. I think it's important not to overreact. You can't break the trend. Yeah, I must strongly believe that the technology can make water much better. People say China economy is getting slower. I'm happy about 7%, even 5%. Even 5% of the GDP of the number of China of the second-large economy is big enough. But you don't expect China to keep on growing 11%. Because like one human body, when you're 1.8 meters tall, you cannot keep on like a 10% grow every year. You have to grow the quality, your mind, the wisdom. So I think China needs new technology to solve these problems. All these things that China is supposed to do, if we keep on the other ways, we'll go nowhere. This is why I feel excited because people ask me, what is your dream now? Because I never thought I would be today. I can sit here talking to President. I think today people worry a lot about the economy, China economy in the world. But I'm very optimistic. When people start to worry, that is the opportunity is. And I like the American movie. Life is like a box of chocolate. You never know what you're going to get. So I'm pretty optimistic. The opportunity in the future for equality is huge. One of the reasons why we grow in China e-commerce so fast, much faster than the USA, because I never thought, because of the technology, because the internet gave me this opportunity. So I think 1.4 billion people who were born in the 1980s, they are the people of the internet times. They are going to have new ways to solve the world problems. The things you are worried about today, they can solve it. And a human being has these kind of worries for centuries. And young people can always solve it. And today we have the right direction, clean energy, the climate change, all these issues. They will be solved, and these are the great opportunities ahead of us. And today nobody in this century has so many opportunities and so many tools that can use to change other people's life. And I think in this century it's called a DT time data technology. That's why we were born in this century. That's why we, how we can use the internet to help more people. It's given my hand. Thank you.
