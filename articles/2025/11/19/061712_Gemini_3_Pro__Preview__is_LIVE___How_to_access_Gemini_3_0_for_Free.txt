Description:
好的，这是根据您的要求从文本中提炼的核心思想摘要。

### **内容核心思想摘要**

#### **I. Gemini 3 Pro 模型发布与访问**
*   **A. 正式发布**：谷歌备受瞩目的 Gemini 3 Pro 模型预览版现已正式上线。
*   **B. 访问方式**：
    1.  **Google AI Studio 主页**：通过点击 "Try Gemini 3" 直接访问。
    2.  **Playground**：在 Playground 中选择 "Gemini 3 Pro preview" 模型进行交互。

#### **II. 核心功能与演示**
*   **A. 强大的零样本代码生成**：
    *   **AI vs. Real 投票游戏**：仅用一个简单的提示，模型在几十秒内就零样本（zero-shot）生成了一个完整的前端应用，该应用能调用API生成AI图片并从网络获取真实图片。
    *   **Hangman 游戏**：快速生成了一个功能完善、界面美观的 Hangman 猜词游戏。
*   **B. 原生多模态与创意生成**：
    *   模型原生支持图像、音频、视频等多种格式的输入。
    *   能够根据简单指令（如 "Create an SVG of Google Pixel phone"）创建高质量的 SVG 图像。
    *   能快速生成符合特定主题（如 ggplot 2 风格）的 Python 可视化代码。
*   **C. 快速的响应与生成速度**：
    *   无论是代码生成还是对话交互，模型的响应速度都非常快。

#### **III. 技术规格与定价**
*   **A. 定价策略**：
    *   定价相对昂贵，输入和输出的费用均高于 Gemini 2.5 Pro。
    *   输入Token定价为每百万 `$2` (低于20万) 和 `$4` (高于20万)。
    *   输出Token定价为每百万 `$12` (低于20万) 和 `$18` (高于20万)。
*   **B. 技术细节**：
    *   **训练硬件**：使用谷歌自家的 TPU 和 JAX 框架进行训练，而非 Nvidia GPU。
    *   **上下文窗口**：支持高达100万的输入Token。
    *   **输出限制**：输出Token限制为64,000。

#### **IV. 创新模式与生态系统**
*   **A. "Deep Think" 深度思考模式**：
    *   这是一种让模型花费更长时间进行推理的特殊模式。
    *   在此模式下，模型在多个高难度基准测试（如 GPQA）上的表现有显著提升（例如从31%跃升至45%），进一步推动了性能前沿。
*   **B. 广泛的平台集成**：
    *   Gemini 3 已在 Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, Gemini CLI 等平台上线。
    *   同时集成到了 GitHub, JetBrains, Replit 等多个第三方开发平台。

Go to Google A Studio, finally. Go to Google A Studio, finally. Go to Google A Studio, astudio.google.com., astudio.google.com., astudio.google.com., Try Gemini 3. The moment you click it, Try Gemini 3. The moment you click it, Try Gemini 3. The moment you click it, you can go access it. I would like to, you can go access it. I would like to, you can go access it. I would like to, start the video by showing what I built, start the video by showing what I built, start the video by showing what I built, using it. So this is a simple game. All, using it. So this is a simple game. All, using it. So this is a simple game. All, I had to do was I just gave a very, I had to do was I just gave a very, I had to do was I just gave a very, simple naive prompt. build a mini AI, simple naive prompt. build a mini AI, simple naive prompt. build a mini AI, versus real voting game using Nano, versus real voting game using Nano, versus real voting game using Nano, Banana and also any free image service, Banana and also any free image service, Banana and also any free image service, like Unsplash and Google Gemini 3 Pro, like Unsplash and Google Gemini 3 Pro, like Unsplash and Google Gemini 3 Pro, preview created this in zero shot like I, preview created this in zero shot like I, preview created this in zero shot like I, didn't have to give anything else so you, didn't have to give anything else so you, didn't have to give anything else so you, can see how I'm playing when I click, can see how I'm playing when I click, can see how I'm playing when I click, play next round it is going to one, play next round it is going to one, play next round it is going to one, generate an image using its own API so I, generate an image using its own API so I, generate an image using its own API so I, didn't have to give the API key as well, didn't have to give the API key as well, didn't have to give the API key as well, and then it is going to pick one image, and then it is going to pick one image, and then it is going to pick one image, from the internet and all I have to do, from the internet and all I have to do, from the internet and all I have to do, is vote It is going to give me a score, is vote It is going to give me a score, is vote It is going to give me a score, here. It's going to give me a streak. So, here. It's going to give me a streak. So, here. It's going to give me a streak. So, for example, I have to pick which one is, for example, I have to pick which one is, for example, I have to pick which one is, AI generated. And it's quite obvious, AI generated. And it's quite obvious, AI generated. And it's quite obvious, this is and it says I'm correct. And it, this is and it says I'm correct. And it, this is and it says I'm correct. And it, gives me the prompt that it used to, gives me the prompt that it used to, gives me the prompt that it used to, generate. So all these things are, generate. So all these things are, generate. So all these things are, happening on the go. I mean we are not, happening on the go. I mean we are not, happening on the go. I mean we are not, obviously talking about the game itself, obviously talking about the game itself, obviously talking about the game itself, but the fact that in 41 seconds it talk, but the fact that in 41 seconds it talk, but the fact that in 41 seconds it talk, about 41 seconds in 100 seconds overall, about 41 seconds in 100 seconds overall, about 41 seconds in 100 seconds overall, this entire thing is generated. You can, this entire thing is generated. You can, this entire thing is generated. You can, see the diff file. You can see the, see the diff file. You can see the, see the diff file. You can see the, entire file. If you want to go deploy, entire file. If you want to go deploy, entire file. If you want to go deploy, it, you can deploy it. So this is the, it, you can deploy it. So this is the, it, you can deploy it. So this is the, build feature within Google A studio, build feature within Google A studio, build feature within Google A studio, which I'll show you shortly. But, which I'll show you shortly. But, which I'll show you shortly. But, otherwise, if you were to just use the, otherwise, if you were to just use the, otherwise, if you were to just use the, model, like I said, you can go to home, model, like I said, you can go to home, model, like I said, you can go to home, click try Gemini 3, and then come back, click try Gemini 3, and then come back, click try Gemini 3, and then come back, here. This is option one. Option two is, here. This is option one. Option two is, here. This is option one. Option two is, go to home, click playground. Once you, go to home, click playground. Once you, go to home, click playground. Once you, click playground, you would see Gemini 3, click playground, you would see Gemini 3, click playground, you would see Gemini 3, Pro preview. Gemini 3 Pro preview. You, Pro preview. Gemini 3 Pro preview. You, Pro preview. Gemini 3 Pro preview. You, can see here details. So this is the, can see here details. So this is the, can see here details. So this is the, detail of the model here. You can see, detail of the model here. You can see, detail of the model here. You can see, the pricing that they are doing here is, the pricing that they are doing here is, the pricing that they are doing here is, right now it's in preview. So we will, right now it's in preview. So we will, right now it's in preview. So we will, get to know the actual full pricing, get to know the actual full pricing, get to know the actual full pricing, after the model goes in like the GA, after the model goes in like the GA, after the model goes in like the GA, generally available mode. But for right, generally available mode. But for right, generally available mode. But for right, now for less than 200,000 input token uh, now for less than 200,000 input token uh, now for less than 200,000 input token uh, you are pay you're paying $2 per million, you are pay you're paying $2 per million, you are pay you're paying $2 per million, token and $12 per million output tokens., token and $12 per million output tokens., token and $12 per million output tokens., And greater than 200,000 you're going to, And greater than 200,000 you're going to, And greater than 200,000 you're going to, pay $4 input and $18 output token. So, pay $4 input and $18 output token. So, pay $4 input and $18 output token. So, the pricing is quite expensive. So if, the pricing is quite expensive. So if, the pricing is quite expensive. So if, you see for example when you compare it, you see for example when you compare it, you see for example when you compare it, to Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro was, to Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro was, to Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro was, $15 output token and this is $18 output, $15 output token and this is $18 output, $15 output token and this is $18 output, token. Both input and output are more, token. Both input and output are more, token. Both input and output are more, expensive. I think Google is betting, expensive. I think Google is betting, expensive. I think Google is betting, heavily on the model's capability and, heavily on the model's capability and, heavily on the model's capability and, also I think they might uh be doing good, also I think they might uh be doing good, also I think they might uh be doing good, if less people use it because they don't, if less people use it because they don't, if less people use it because they don't, have to improve the service or handle, have to improve the service or handle, have to improve the service or handle, like load balancing and all the outages, like load balancing and all the outages, like load balancing and all the outages, that usually you know other model, that usually you know other model, that usually you know other model, providers have to handle. So I think, providers have to handle. So I think, providers have to handle. So I think, this is like seriously a preview model., this is like seriously a preview model., this is like seriously a preview model., So let me click the model here. You can, So let me click the model here. You can, So let me click the model here. You can, see the model has been selected. Now I, see the model has been selected. Now I, see the model has been selected. Now I, can go chat with the model. So now you, can go chat with the model. So now you, can go chat with the model. So now you, can go ask any question that you want., can go ask any question that you want., can go ask any question that you want., Like for example I just simply asked, Like for example I just simply asked, Like for example I just simply asked, Google Pixel phone SVG here. So this is, Google Pixel phone SVG here. So this is, Google Pixel phone SVG here. So this is, my prompt. Very simple prompt. Create an, my prompt. Very simple prompt. Create an, my prompt. Very simple prompt. Create an, SVG of Google Pixel phone. And you can, SVG of Google Pixel phone. And you can, SVG of Google Pixel phone. And you can, see the model started thinking. So this, see the model started thinking. So this, see the model started thinking. So this, is its internal chain of thought. And we, is its internal chain of thought. And we, is its internal chain of thought. And we, do not know if it is a raw chain of, do not know if it is a raw chain of, do not know if it is a raw chain of, thought or it is let's say a summarized, thought or it is let's say a summarized, thought or it is let's say a summarized, chain of thought like what open a is, chain of thought like what open a is, chain of thought like what open a is, doing but you can see here it is going, doing but you can see here it is going, doing but you can see here it is going, through the thought and finally creating, through the thought and finally creating, through the thought and finally creating, something and after I have the SVG I can, something and after I have the SVG I can, something and after I have the SVG I can, run it show the preview and you can see, run it show the preview and you can see, run it show the preview and you can see, this almost looks like the back of the, this almost looks like the back of the, this almost looks like the back of the, Google Pixel phone. I've got like an old, Google Pixel phone. I've got like an old, Google Pixel phone. I've got like an old, Google Pixel phone except the height. I, Google Pixel phone except the height. I, Google Pixel phone except the height. I, think everything else is very decent. So, think everything else is very decent. So, think everything else is very decent. So, I'm going to go back to playground, I'm going to go back to playground, I'm going to go back to playground, again. Click Gemini 3 Pro preview and I, again. Click Gemini 3 Pro preview and I, again. Click Gemini 3 Pro preview and I, can just like literally ask any, can just like literally ask any, can just like literally ask any, question. Create a simple Python program, question. Create a simple Python program, question. Create a simple Python program, that can create a uh Cabbond, that can create a uh Cabbond, that can create a uh Cabbond, bar chart in the theme of ggplot 2. Make, bar chart in the theme of ggplot 2. Make, bar chart in the theme of ggplot 2. Make, sure to use any default data. Send it., sure to use any default data. Send it., sure to use any default data. Send it., Once you send this, you're going to have, Once you send this, you're going to have, Once you send this, you're going to have, the code written. And this is a natively, the code written. And this is a natively, the code written. And this is a natively, multimodel model. That means you can, multimodel model. That means you can, multimodel model. That means you can, upload audio clips, you can upload, upload audio clips, you can upload, upload audio clips, you can upload, images for it to understand. And you can, images for it to understand. And you can, images for it to understand. And you can, see here it managed to use the code and, see here it managed to use the code and, see here it managed to use the code and, your code can be verified. So um the, your code can be verified. So um the, your code can be verified. So um the, code is like it's using ggplot 2. And um, code is like it's using ggplot 2. And um, code is like it's using ggplot 2. And um, yeah, so the model is very fast. Um I'm, yeah, so the model is very fast. Um I'm, yeah, so the model is very fast. Um I'm, going to make a separate video about how, going to make a separate video about how, going to make a separate video about how, to test the model and all the all those, to test the model and all the all those, to test the model and all the all those, things. But for now, I wanted to show, things. But for now, I wanted to show, things. But for now, I wanted to show, you that the model is available. So the, you that the model is available. So the, you that the model is available. So the, second feature is go to build and you, second feature is go to build and you, second feature is go to build and you, can select Gemini 3 Pro as preview as, can select Gemini 3 Pro as preview as, can select Gemini 3 Pro as preview as, the model. So this is the one I used to, the model. So this is the one I used to, the model. So this is the one I used to, create the demo I showed you at the, create the demo I showed you at the, create the demo I showed you at the, start of this video.

Another interesting, unreal uh so far. Another interesting, unreal uh so far. Another interesting, aspect of the benchmark is they have, aspect of the benchmark is they have, aspect of the benchmark is they have, separately benchmarked Gemini 3 deep, separately benchmarked Gemini 3 deep, separately benchmarked Gemini 3 deep, think. So instead of using the LLM as, think. So instead of using the LLM as, think. So instead of using the LLM as, vanilla, they have slapped deep think on, vanilla, they have slapped deep think on, vanilla, they have slapped deep think on, top of Gemini 3 and then said that, top of Gemini 3 and then said that, top of Gemini 3 and then said that, whenever they used deep think on top of, whenever they used deep think on top of, whenever they used deep think on top of, Gemini 3, it further improved the, Gemini 3, it further improved the, Gemini 3, it further improved the, benchmarks. Like for example, humanity's, benchmarks. Like for example, humanity's, benchmarks. Like for example, humanity's, last exam, Gemini 3 Pro got 37.5%, last exam, Gemini 3 Pro got 37.5%, last exam, Gemini 3 Pro got 37.5%, while Gemini 3 deep think got 41%. So, while Gemini 3 deep think got 41%. So, while Gemini 3 deep think got 41%. So, this is the deep think mode where the, this is the deep think mode where the, this is the deep think mode where the, LLM can take more time longer time to, LLM can take more time longer time to, LLM can take more time longer time to, reason and you can see across all the, reason and you can see across all the, reason and you can see across all the, benchmarks GPQA diamond arc AGA2 there, benchmarks GPQA diamond arc AGA2 there, benchmarks GPQA diamond arc AGA2 there, is a huge jump from 31% it is 45%. In, is a huge jump from 31% it is 45%. In, is a huge jump from 31% it is 45%. In, fact the 31% itself is like the industry, fact the 31% itself is like the industry, fact the 31% itself is like the industry, leading but it further pushes the, leading but it further pushes the, leading but it further pushes the, frontier and then it has got 45%. So, frontier and then it has got 45%. So, frontier and then it has got 45%. So, across all the benchmarks you can see, across all the benchmarks you can see, across all the benchmarks you can see, whenever they use deep think as a mode, whenever they use deep think as a mode, whenever they use deep think as a mode, deep think as a model like the longer, deep think as a model like the longer, deep think as a model like the longer, thinking model it pushes the boundaries, thinking model it pushes the boundaries, thinking model it pushes the boundaries, further but it'll be pretty interesting, further but it'll be pretty interesting, further but it'll be pretty interesting, to see how that model will help in the, to see how that model will help in the, to see how that model will help in the, real world but for now Gemini 3 is, real world but for now Gemini 3 is, real world but for now Gemini 3 is, available on Google AI studio Vortex AI, available on Google AI studio Vortex AI, available on Google AI studio Vortex AI, Gemini CLA and they've got a new agentic, Gemini CLA and they've got a new agentic, Gemini CLA and they've got a new agentic, development platform again one more I, development platform again one more I, development platform again one more I, mean Google has already got Jules Google, mean Google has already got Jules Google, mean Google has already got Jules Google, has got Google AI studio Google has got, has got Google AI studio Google has got, has got Google AI studio Google has got, Gemini CLI now Google has got something, Gemini CLI now Google has got something, Gemini CLI now Google has got something, called Google anti-gravity which we'll, called Google anti-gravity which we'll, called Google anti-gravity which we'll, probably cover later on and cursor, probably cover later on and cursor, probably cover later on and cursor, GitHub, Jet Brains, Manis, Replet and, GitHub, Jet Brains, Manis, Replet and, GitHub, Jet Brains, Manis, Replet and, more of the platforms. Let me know what, more of the platforms. Let me know what, more of the platforms. Let me know what, you think about this particular model., you think about this particular model., you think about this particular model., See you in another video. Happy, See you in another video.
