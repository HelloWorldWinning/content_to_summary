### **核心观点纲要**

#### **一、 Gemini 3 Pro 发布概述**
*   **发布背景**: 经过8个月的期待，谷歌正式推出其最新旗舰模型 Gemini 3 Pro。
*   **核心评价**: 作者认为该模型是其迄今为止使用过最智能、能力最强的AI模型，是一个“绝对的野兽”。

#### **二、 核心性能与竞品对比**
1.  **综合智能与推理**:
    *   **LLM Arena排名**: 在开发者和用户的盲测对比中，以显著优势位列第一。
    *   **高难度测试**: 在涵盖哲学、工程、科学等领域的“人类最后的大考”中表现优异，仅次于采用多模型集成的Grok 4。
    *   **数学能力**: 几乎完善了数学能力，能够解决微积分3等级的复杂问题。
2.  **代码能力**:
    *   **基准测试**: 与Claude Sonnet 4.5等模型并列为业界最佳的编程代理。
    *   **实践表现**: 在实际项目构建中表现出色，能够“一击即中”解决复杂编程任务。
3.  **多模态能力 (MMMU)**:
    *   **视觉理解**: 在图像和视频理解方面得分极高，能够深入分析内容。
    *   **应用实例**:
        *   分析体育视频（如匹克球）并提供技术改进建议。
        *   理解复杂的工程图纸（如热力学、电子电路）并提供相应的代码解决方案。
        *   将静态图片转化为可交互的Web应用，用于教学演示。
4.  **定价与上下文窗口**:
    *   **价格**: 与GPT-5.1基本持平，但远低于Claude和Grok系列模型，性价比极高。
    *   **上下文窗口**: 支持高达100万个Token，在处理大型项目、数据库和复杂应用时具有巨大优势。

#### **三、 颠覆性功能演示 (Demos)**
1.  **飞行模拟器**:
    *   **任务**: 创建一个飞机围绕弯曲地球表面平行飞行的模拟程序。
    *   **挑战**: 该任务涉及微积分3和高等物理学，对人类工程师而言需要数月时间。
    *   **结果**: Gemini 3 Pro在2分钟内一次性生成了完美的解决方案，而其他模型均失败。这个例子“震撼了作者的大脑”。
2.  **交互式收音机电路**:
    *   **任务**: 根据一张手绘的收音机电路图，创建一个可交互的教学Web应用。
    *   **结果**: Gemini 3 Pro不仅精确复刻了电路，还使其可交互（调节频率、音量），并能生成音频模拟信号，同时解释每个电子元件的功能。
3.  **3D游戏创建**:
    *   **任务**: 结合“神庙逃亡”、“我的世界”和“创战纪”三个游戏的概念，创造一款新游戏。
    *   **结果**: 快速生成了高质量的3D游戏，并能根据作者的反馈（如“增加难度”）实时迭代，展示了其在创意实现和快速开发方面的潜力。

#### **四、 生态整合：代理模式 (Agent Mode)**
*   **新功能**: 即将在Gemini Ultra订阅计划中推出“代理模式”。
*   **核心作用**: 将Gemini 3 Pro深度整合到用户的Google生态（Gmail、Google Drive等）中，使其能够作为智能代理自动执行整理收件箱、处理邮件等复杂任务，极大地提升工作效率。

### **核心结论 (一句话)**
Gemini 3 Pro凭借其在综合智能、代码生成和多模态理解方面的颠覆性能力，以及极具竞争力的成本效益，已成为当前市场上最强大且全面的AI模型。

So, now, it's time to see what Gemini 3 Pro is, it's time to see what Gemini 3 Pro is, it's time to see what Gemini 3 Pro is, fully capable of. And the best place to, fully capable of. And the best place to, fully capable of. And the best place to, try this out is to hop over to Google AI, try this out is to hop over to Google AI, try this out is to hop over to Google AI, Studio where you can just quickly, Studio where you can just quickly, Studio where you can just quickly, describe the idea you want to bring to, describe the idea you want to bring to, describe the idea you want to bring to, life and have Gemini 3 build it for you., life and have Gemini 3 build it for you., life and have Gemini 3 build it for you., And heck, if you're not feeling, And heck, if you're not feeling, And heck, if you're not feeling, creative, click I'm feeling lucky and it, creative, click I'm feeling lucky and it, creative, click I'm feeling lucky and it, will actually come up with cool ideas, will actually come up with cool ideas, will actually come up with cool ideas, for you. But with that out of the way, for you. But with that out of the way, for you. But with that out of the way, let's actually dive into a few of the, let's actually dive into a few of the, let's actually dive into a few of the, different apps that I've built so you, different apps that I've built so you, different apps that I've built so you, guys can see just how powerful this, guys can see just how powerful this, guys can see just how powerful this, model is. And what I want to do is just, model is. And what I want to do is just, model is. And what I want to do is just, show the demo and explain briefly like, show the demo and explain briefly like, show the demo and explain briefly like, why this is such an insanely powerful, why this is such an insanely powerful, why this is such an insanely powerful, tool. So first let's hop over to the, tool. So first let's hop over to the, tool. So first let's hop over to the, first demo which is a flight simulator, first demo which is a flight simulator, first demo which is a flight simulator, where you're seeing how we are coding up, where you're seeing how we are coding up, where you're seeing how we are coding up, an application where planes have to fly, an application where planes have to fly, an application where planes have to fly, perfectly parallel to the surface of the, perfectly parallel to the surface of the, perfectly parallel to the surface of the, earth. So over here on the left we have, earth. So over here on the left we have, earth. So over here on the left we have, Gemini 3 Pro where you can see it, Gemini 3 Pro where you can see it, Gemini 3 Pro where you can see it, actually did it. We have planes flying, actually did it. We have planes flying, actually did it. We have planes flying, all over the earth. We can speed things, all over the earth. We can speed things, all over the earth. We can speed things, up and you can see these planes zipping, up and you can see these planes zipping, up and you can see these planes zipping, around. Over here on the right though, around. Over here on the right though, around. Over here on the right though, you can see the exact same prompt over, you can see the exact same prompt over, you can see the exact same prompt over, in Gemini 2.5 Pro and it basically just, in Gemini 2.5 Pro and it basically just, in Gemini 2.5 Pro and it basically just, completely missed the mark. So, first, completely missed the mark. So, first, completely missed the mark. So, first, off, Gemini 3 actually crushed this., off, Gemini 3 actually crushed this., off, Gemini 3 actually crushed this., Now, what I want to dive into is some of, Now, what I want to dive into is some of, Now, what I want to dive into is some of, the code and explain why this is such a, the code and explain why this is such a, the code and explain why this is such a, hard problem and give you some context, hard problem and give you some context, hard problem and give you some context, because this example is the example that, because this example is the example that, because this example is the example that, just it broke my brain and I was like, just it broke my brain and I was like, just it broke my brain and I was like, "All right, I give up. AI, it wins." So, "All right, I give up. AI, it wins." So, "All right, I give up. AI, it wins." So, here's what I mean. When I started off, here's what I mean. When I started off, here's what I mean. When I started off, my first engineering job at GTRI, I was, my first engineering job at GTRI, I was, my first engineering job at GTRI, I was, given a task to build this type of, given a task to build this type of, given a task to build this type of, application. And the reason why this is, application. And the reason why this is, application. And the reason why this is, so hard is because to fully build this, so hard is because to fully build this, so hard is because to fully build this, out, you have to understand, you know, out, you have to understand, you know, out, you have to understand, you know, the way planes work. You have to, the way planes work. You have to, the way planes work. You have to, understand calculus 3 because you have, understand calculus 3 because you have, understand calculus 3 because you have, to basically make it to where planes can, to basically make it to where planes can, to basically make it to where planes can, fly tangentially to a curved surface., fly tangentially to a curved surface., fly tangentially to a curved surface., And all around it is a like M's level, And all around it is a like M's level, And all around it is a like M's level, problem. It took me 2 months to build, problem. It took me 2 months to build, problem. It took me 2 months to build, out a very very identical demo to this., out a very very identical demo to this., out a very very identical demo to this., And whenever I gave a two paragraph, And whenever I gave a two paragraph, And whenever I gave a two paragraph, prompt to Gemini 3 Pro, I was like, prompt to Gemini 3 Pro, I was like, prompt to Gemini 3 Pro, I was like, "Hey, here's what you need to solve.", "Hey, here's what you need to solve.", "Hey, here's what you need to solve.", And which is basically like build this, And which is basically like build this, And which is basically like build this, type of application where it must fly, type of application where it must fly, type of application where it must fly, perfectly parallel to the curved earth, perfectly parallel to the curved earth, perfectly parallel to the curved earth, and don't drift. That's the hard part., and don't drift. That's the hard part., and don't drift. That's the hard part., And and then literally 2 minutes later, And and then literally 2 minutes later, And and then literally 2 minutes later, Gemini goes, "Oh yeah, of course. I'll, Gemini goes, "Oh yeah, of course. I'll, Gemini goes, "Oh yeah, of course. I'll, build it for you." And cranked out this, build it for you." And cranked out this, build it for you." And cranked out this, application right here. And if you go I, application right here. And if you go I, application right here. And if you go I, mean if we actually like dive into like, mean if we actually like dive into like, mean if we actually like dive into like, how the actual code works and like some, how the actual code works and like some, how the actual code works and like some, of the math behind it like you can see, of the math behind it like you can see, of the math behind it like you can see, like we're doing vectors. We're doing, like we're doing vectors. We're doing, like we're doing vectors. We're doing, like it the math behind this I blacked, like it the math behind this I blacked, like it the math behind this I blacked, out. I forgot about this math. I thought, out. I forgot about this math. I thought, out. I forgot about this math. I thought, I would never have to touch it again., I would never have to touch it again., I would never have to touch it again., But Gemini 3 can do it insanely in 2, But Gemini 3 can do it insanely in 2, But Gemini 3 can do it insanely in 2, minutes. So I just went like the second, minutes. So I just went like the second, minutes. So I just went like the second, I saw this I was like oh my gosh this is, I saw this I was like oh my gosh this is, I saw this I was like oh my gosh this is, the most powerful model I've ever seen., the most powerful model I've ever seen., the most powerful model I've ever seen., I tried to recreate this with Claude 4.5, I tried to recreate this with Claude 4.5, I tried to recreate this with Claude 4.5, and GPT in different agent building, and GPT in different agent building, and GPT in different agent building, platforms like just on my local computer, platforms like just on my local computer, platforms like just on my local computer, and pretty much everyone else was doing, and pretty much everyone else was doing, and pretty much everyone else was doing, something similar to this. Gemini 3 Pro, something similar to this. Gemini 3 Pro, something similar to this. Gemini 3 Pro, is the only model I was able to generate, is the only model I was able to generate, is the only model I was able to generate, that could actually solve the problem in, that could actually solve the problem in, that could actually solve the problem in, a single shot. That's the crazy part., a single shot. That's the crazy part., a single shot. That's the crazy part., This was one shot. So, I hope your, This was one shot. So, I hope your, This was one shot. So, I hope your, brain's freaking out like mine was. And, brain's freaking out like mine was. And, brain's freaking out like mine was. And, now what I want to do is hop over to a, now what I want to do is hop over to a, now what I want to do is hop over to a, few more cooler interactive demos that, few more cooler interactive demos that, few more cooler interactive demos that, Gemini 3 Pro was able to knock out as, Gemini 3 Pro was able to knock out as, Gemini 3 Pro was able to knock out as, well. So, welcome to demo number two, well. So, welcome to demo number two, well. So, welcome to demo number two, where we are going to stress test the, where we are going to stress test the, where we are going to stress test the, model's ability to visually understand, model's ability to visually understand, model's ability to visually understand, and reason through just random drawings, and reason through just random drawings, and reason through just random drawings, of radio circuits to say, "Hey, can you, of radio circuits to say, "Hey, can you, of radio circuits to say, "Hey, can you, please generate an interactive UI where, please generate an interactive UI where, please generate an interactive UI where, you teach me about how this circuit, you teach me about how this circuit, you teach me about how this circuit, works and if you could actually make it, works and if you could actually make it, works and if you could actually make it, to where our circuit plays some noise as, to where our circuit plays some noise as, to where our circuit plays some noise as, this radio receives a signal." So I was, this radio receives a signal." So I was, this radio receives a signal." So I was, confident that it would struggle with, confident that it would struggle with, confident that it would struggle with, this one cuz this is a very hard task., this one cuz this is a very hard task., this one cuz this is a very hard task., But unfortunately and well I mean I, But unfortunately and well I mean I, But unfortunately and well I mean I, guess it is fortunately it crushed it., guess it is fortunately it crushed it., guess it is fortunately it crushed it., So you can see that Gemini 3 directly, So you can see that Gemini 3 directly, So you can see that Gemini 3 directly, copied this exact circuit that we saw, copied this exact circuit that we saw, copied this exact circuit that we saw, over here verbatim. Everything about, over here verbatim. Everything about, over here verbatim. Everything about, this it visually understood everything, this it visually understood everything, this it visually understood everything, about it. Not only did it understand, about it. Not only did it understand, about it. Not only did it understand, what it saw in the paper but it could, what it saw in the paper but it could, what it saw in the paper but it could, reason through how this circuit works., reason through how this circuit works., reason through how this circuit works., It understands that it's a radio. And, It understands that it's a radio. And, It understands that it's a radio. And, what's insane about it I mean it did it, what's insane about it I mean it did it, what's insane about it I mean it did it, in a single shot. once again, which is, in a single shot. once again, which is, in a single shot. once again, which is, the craziest part, but it actually made, the craziest part, but it actually made, the craziest part, but it actually made, a really cool interactive demo to where, a really cool interactive demo to where, a really cool interactive demo to where, we could click through. We can actually, we could click through. We can actually, we could click through. We can actually, learn about how each one of these, learn about how each one of these, learn about how each one of these, different components work, what it is, different components work, what it is, different components work, what it is, how it works and connects to everything, how it works and connects to everything, how it works and connects to everything, else, and how these transistors work., else, and how these transistors work., else, and how these transistors work., Like, this is just crazy that it can, Like, this is just crazy that it can, Like, this is just crazy that it can, reason through everything and do all, reason through everything and do all, reason through everything and do all, this in a single shot. So outside of, this in a single shot. So outside of, this in a single shot. So outside of, that, I also want to show you how it can, that, I also want to show you how it can, that, I also want to show you how it can, actually we can actually play with this, actually we can actually play with this, actually we can actually play with this, circuit to learn about tuning, circuit to learn about tuning, circuit to learn about tuning, frequencies and how we can play with, frequencies and how we can play with, frequencies and how we can play with, feedback and volume like all the core, feedback and volume like all the core, feedback and volume like all the core, components of electrical engineering, components of electrical engineering, components of electrical engineering, which I swear I did know at one point, which I swear I did know at one point, which I swear I did know at one point, but I forgot. Please don't tell my, but I forgot. Please don't tell my, but I forgot. Please don't tell my, college professors. So let's actually, college professors. So let's actually, college professors. So let's actually, turn it on so you guys can listen to it, turn it on so you guys can listen to it, turn it on so you guys can listen to it, and you'll hear how we're not tracking, and you'll hear how we're not tracking, and you'll hear how we're not tracking, the signal and by tuning the knobs and, the signal and by tuning the knobs and, the signal and by tuning the knobs and, adjusting this circuit we can actually, adjusting this circuit we can actually, adjusting this circuit we can actually, listen to the radio. In this case just, listen to the radio. In this case just, listen to the radio. In this case just, some like a signal. You'll hear it. So, some like a signal. You'll hear it. So, some like a signal. You'll hear it. So, let's go for it., Okay, so we are on. You can see it's, Okay, so we are on. You can see it's, yellow. So now we're going to change, yellow. So now we're going to change, yellow. So now we're going to change, feedback., So yeah, we've actually locked onto the, So yeah, we've actually locked onto the, signal. And outside of that, we can, signal. And outside of that, we can, signal. And outside of that, we can, actually change volume as well if we, actually change volume as well if we, actually change volume as well if we, want, which is gain. So you can see we, want, which is gain. So you can see we, want, which is gain. So you can see we, can turn it down, we can turn it up., can turn it down, we can turn it up., can turn it down, we can turn it up., Yeah, that's insane, guys. The fact that, Yeah, that's insane, guys. The fact that, Yeah, that's insane, guys. The fact that, we built a radio, sorry, Gemini 3 Pro, we built a radio, sorry, Gemini 3 Pro, we built a radio, sorry, Gemini 3 Pro, built a radio from a picture, that's, built a radio from a picture, that's, built a radio from a picture, that's, just crazy. So, I hope you guys are, just crazy. So, I hope you guys are, just crazy. So, I hope you guys are, getting excited just like I am. So, getting excited just like I am. So, getting excited just like I am. So, enough with the science stuff. What, enough with the science stuff. What, enough with the science stuff. What, we're going to do next is go show a, we're going to do next is go show a, we're going to do next is go show a, really cool video of and demo of this, really cool video of and demo of this, really cool video of and demo of this, actually building out beautiful games as, actually building out beautiful games as, actually building out beautiful games as, well. So, let's go ahead and hop over to, well. So, let's go ahead and hop over to, well. So, let's go ahead and hop over to, demo number three. So, here is demo, demo number three. So, here is demo, demo number three. So, here is demo, number three. I've officially created a, number three. I've officially created a, number three. I've officially created a, game I can't beat. I'm awful at it, to, game I can't beat. I'm awful at it, to, game I can't beat. I'm awful at it, to, be honest. So, let me show you the game, be honest. So, let me show you the game, be honest. So, let me show you the game, and I'll quickly show you what uh I did, and I'll quickly show you what uh I did, and I'll quickly show you what uh I did, to make it. So, first things first, you, to make it. So, first things first, you, to make it. So, first things first, you, can see we're basically playing like a I, can see we're basically playing like a I, can see we're basically playing like a I, mean, I'm bad at this, but you can see, mean, I'm bad at this, but you can see, mean, I'm bad at this, but you can see, we're basically having cubes to where, we're basically having cubes to where, we're basically having cubes to where, we're having to like jump through a, we're having to like jump through a, we're having to like jump through a, minefield and we're trying to collect, minefield and we're trying to collect, minefield and we're trying to collect, points and we have moving parts to where, points and we have moving parts to where, points and we have moving parts to where, we can actually, you know, make the game, we can actually, you know, make the game, we can actually, you know, make the game, as as difficult as possible. U but, as as difficult as possible. U but, as as difficult as possible. U but, basically that is the game in a nutshell, basically that is the game in a nutshell, basically that is the game in a nutshell, and it was insanely easy to make. So you, and it was insanely easy to make. So you, and it was insanely easy to make. So you, can see we have a, you know, a little, can see we have a, you know, a little, can see we have a, you know, a little, bit more of a beefy prompt this time, bit more of a beefy prompt this time, bit more of a beefy prompt this time, where we're basically saying, "Hey, your, where we're basically saying, "Hey, your, where we're basically saying, "Hey, your, job is to make a single page website, job is to make a single page website, job is to make a single page website, where we basically are a combination of, where we basically are a combination of, where we basically are a combination of, Temple Run and Minecraft and Tron." And, Temple Run and Minecraft and Tron." And, Temple Run and Minecraft and Tron." And, this type of game, you know, all I did, this type of game, you know, all I did, this type of game, you know, all I did, was I passed to Gemini. I want to make a, was I passed to Gemini. I want to make a, was I passed to Gemini. I want to make a, combination of these three games and go, combination of these three games and go, combination of these three games and go, off and build it and give me, off and build it and give me, off and build it and give me, instructions that I can pass to an AI, instructions that I can pass to an AI, instructions that I can pass to an AI, agent. So I'm using AI to create props, agent. So I'm using AI to create props, agent. So I'm using AI to create props, for AI. And it absolutely crushed it., for AI. And it absolutely crushed it., for AI. And it absolutely crushed it., And what was pretty funny is it, And what was pretty funny is it, And what was pretty funny is it, actually, you know, crushed it right out, actually, you know, crushed it right out, actually, you know, crushed it right out, the gate and I had to tell it like, the gate and I had to tell it like, the gate and I had to tell it like, "Hey, can you make it a little bit, "Hey, can you make it a little bit, "Hey, can you make it a little bit, harder cuz this is too easy to actually, harder cuz this is too easy to actually, harder cuz this is too easy to actually, work on." So it went through and was, work on." So it went through and was, work on." So it went through and was, like, "Yeah, of course I can make it, like, "Yeah, of course I can make it, like, "Yeah, of course I can make it, harder." And then I just add kept, harder." And then I just add kept, harder." And then I just add kept, tweaking it. I was like, "Oh, it'd be, tweaking it. I was like, "Oh, it'd be, tweaking it. I was like, "Oh, it'd be, cool if it did this. It'd be cool if it, cool if it did this. It'd be cool if it, cool if it did this. It'd be cool if it, did this." And eventually it made the, did this." And eventually it made the, did this." And eventually it made the, game that you guys can see right now, game that you guys can see right now, game that you guys can see right now, which is crazy because you can kind of, which is crazy because you can kind of, which is crazy because you can kind of, start to see the future if you play this, start to see the future if you play this, start to see the future if you play this, out to where eventually we're all going, out to where eventually we're all going, out to where eventually we're all going, to have video games to where we can at, to have video games to where we can at, to have video games to where we can at, any point just tweak the video game to, any point just tweak the video game to, any point just tweak the video game to, be the exact game that we want. Heck, be the exact game that we want. Heck, be the exact game that we want. Heck, eventually it's just going to know what, eventually it's just going to know what, eventually it's just going to know what, we're doing and where we're getting, we're doing and where we're getting, we're doing and where we're getting, frustrated and like eventually code out, frustrated and like eventually code out, frustrated and like eventually code out, iteration 2 in real time because it's, iteration 2 in real time because it's, iteration 2 in real time because it's, building out the game in 120 seconds., building out the game in 120 seconds., building out the game in 120 seconds., It's adding in iterations every 60, It's adding in iterations every 60, It's adding in iterations every 60, seconds. So like you can see just how, seconds. So like you can see just how, seconds. So like you can see just how, quickly we're building out new stuff, quickly we're building out new stuff, quickly we're building out new stuff, using this. So once again, Gemini 3 Pro, using this. So once again, Gemini 3 Pro, using this. So once again, Gemini 3 Pro, is an absolute beast. And quick side, is an absolute beast. And quick side, is an absolute beast. And quick side, note, if you do want to see how you can, note, if you do want to see how you can, note, if you do want to see how you can, actually start building out your own, actually start building out your own, actually start building out your own, applications that are more advanced, applications that are more advanced, applications that are more advanced, your own AI applications, you're, your own AI applications, you're, your own AI applications, you're, definitely going to want to check out, definitely going to want to check out, definitely going to want to check out, the second video that I have right here, the second video that I have right here, the second video that I have right here, on this channel. I just released it, on this channel. I just released it, on this channel. I just released it, too, where we go deep into Google's, too, where we go deep into Google's, too, where we go deep into Google's, newest tool called Anti-gravity. This is, newest tool called Anti-gravity. This is, newest tool called Anti-gravity. This is, my new favorite AI coding editor. You, my new favorite AI coding editor.

Got more things to show, you guys. All right. So, one of the next, you guys. All right. So, one of the next, you guys. All right. So, one of the next, features I want to show you is how, features I want to show you is how, features I want to show you is how, Google is adding in Gemini 3 Pro inside, Google is adding in Gemini 3 Pro inside, Google is adding in Gemini 3 Pro inside, of Gemini. And I know, you know, how, of Gemini. And I know, you know, how, of Gemini. And I know, you know, how, many times can you say Gemini, but, many times can you say Gemini, but, many times can you say Gemini, but, basically what you're going to notice as, basically what you're going to notice as, basically what you're going to notice as, soon as tomorrow goes live whenever you, soon as tomorrow goes live whenever you, soon as tomorrow goes live whenever you, click on tools and you're on the ultra, click on tools and you're on the ultra, click on tools and you're on the ultra, plan, you're going to start to see, plan, you're going to start to see, plan, you're going to start to see, towards the bottom a new feature called, towards the bottom a new feature called, towards the bottom a new feature called, agent mode. and agent mode. It behaves, agent mode. and agent mode. It behaves, agent mode. and agent mode. It behaves, from what I've seen just like the way, from what I've seen just like the way, from what I've seen just like the way, agents do in Open AI except everything, agents do in Open AI except everything, agents do in Open AI except everything, is connected to your Google Suite. So, is connected to your Google Suite. So, is connected to your Google Suite. So, let me actually just show you a quick, let me actually just show you a quick, let me actually just show you a quick, video that they shared so you guys can, video that they shared so you guys can, video that they shared so you guys can, see this in action cuz this is the, see this in action cuz this is the, see this in action cuz this is the, moment of AI that I've been waiting for., moment of AI that I've been waiting for., moment of AI that I've been waiting for., So, what you can see is you can select, So, what you can see is you can select, So, what you can see is you can select, hey, I would like to use agent mode and, hey, I would like to use agent mode and, hey, I would like to use agent mode and, then you can start to give commands, then you can start to give commands, then you can start to give commands, about your inbox. So, this is where I, about your inbox. So, this is where I, about your inbox. So, this is where I, think you know, you know, work is about, think you know, you know, work is about, think you know, you know, work is about, to just explode. We're about to become, to just explode. We're about to become, to just explode. We're about to become, so much more efficient now that AI is, so much more efficient now that AI is, so much more efficient now that AI is, easily integrated into all of our tools., easily integrated into all of our tools., easily integrated into all of our tools., So you can see we're saying organize my, So you can see we're saying organize my, So you can see we're saying organize my, inbox. It's going to look through all of, inbox. It's going to look through all of, inbox. It's going to look through all of, our different task and we can say like, our different task and we can say like, our different task and we can say like, yeah please perform the suggested action, yeah please perform the suggested action, yeah please perform the suggested action, on each of these tasks. Also here's, on each of these tasks. Also here's, on each of these tasks.
