Description:
好的，这是根据您提供的文本内容提炼的核心思想、摘要、框架和概念图。

### **核心思想摘要**

#### 1. **核心对决：Claude Opus 4.5 vs. Gemini 3 Pro**
本次内容的核心是针对两大顶尖AI编码模型——Claude Opus 4.5和Gemini 3 Pro——进行的一次实战对比测试。测试的目标是评估两者在真实SaaS应用开发场景（从登陆页面到可交互原型）中的表现，尤其是在代码质量、设计美学、产品思维和创新能力方面的差异。

#### 2. **实战测试：构建“遗产仪表盘”SaaS应用**
- **第一轮：登陆页面（Landing Page）**
  - **Claude 4.5**：利用其专属的“前端设计技能”，生成了设计美学出众、基调 subtle（微妙且恰当）的页面，在视觉精致度上胜出。
  - **Gemini 3 Pro**：页面功能完整，但在创意上更“出格”，主动加入了“AI辅助撰写更新”的功能，展现了跳出常规的产品构思能力，但设计感稍逊。

- **第二轮：可交互原型（Clickable Prototype）**
  - **Claude 4.5**：延续了其优秀的设计一致性，构建出的仪表盘功能结构清晰（如时间线、文档、更新），体现了更深入、更成熟的产品设计思维。
  - **Gemini 3 Pro**：原型可用，但整体感觉更偏向“社交动态”而非专业的仪表盘，在产品深度和设计细节上不如Claude。

- **测试结论**：在本次“零到一”的构建测试中，**Claude Opus 4.5** 在设计美学的精致度、产品思维的深度和最终产出的完成度上略胜一筹。

#### 3. **关键方法论：如何最大化AI编码助手效能**
成功的关键不仅仅在于选择哪个模型，更在于使用一套正确的方法论：
- **技能定制 (Claude Skills) 是核心**：这是获得高质量、非模板化结果的关键。
  - **前端设计技能**：调用官方预设技能，可以有效避免千篇一律的“AI设计风格”。
  - **文案写作技能 (Elevated Direct Response)**：通过研究市场上的成功案例（如Cody Sanchez），结合自身的写作风格和品牌声音，创建出独特的、高转化率的文案模型。
  - **页面架构技能**：定义一套标准化的、以转化为目标的页面结构（如英雄区、问题激发、解决方案、社会认同等）。
- **战略性指令 (Strategic Prompting)**：将前期研究和预设的技能相结合，用一个清晰、简洁的指令，就能获得“一击即中”的高质量结果。这套流程将“体力活”（研究、定义风格）前置，从而极大地提升了AI的生成效率和质量。

#### 4. **其他工具探索的启示**
- **Anti-gravity IDE**：在测试中，Gemini 3 Pro 与 Anti-gravity 的结合展示了一种创新的工作流——**“先设计，后编码”**。它首先调用图像生成模型（Nano Banana Pro）创建高保真设计图，然后再根据该图构建前端代码。这个流程更贴近真实开发团队的协作模式，是一个值得关注的优势。

---

### **核心要点**

虽然 Claude Opus 4.5 在本次测试中展现了卓越的设计和产品深度，但真正释放顶尖AI编码模型潜力的关键在于系统性地结合前期研究、个性化技能定制和精准的指令，从而实现技术能力与营销设计的深度融合。

---

### **整体框架**

该内容提出的整体框架是一种**“战略性AI辅助构建”（Strategic AI-Assisted Building）**模型。它强调的不仅是简单的“指令-代码”生成，而是一个包含前期研究、技能工程、精准生成和多工具融合的系统性流程，旨在将个人或团队的独特风格与AI的强大生产力相结合，创造出既美观又能实现商业目标的最终产品。其核心步骤包括：

1.  **基础研究 (Foundational Research)**：分析市场领导者，提炼成功模式。
2.  **技能工程 (Skill Engineering)**：将研究成果和个人风格固化为AI可调用的、标准化的“技能”（Skills）。
3.  **精准生成 (Precision Generation)**：通过调用预设技能，用最简单的指令实现最高质量的输出。
4.  **生态融合与迭代 (Ecosystem Synthesis & Iteration)**：利用不同工具（如IDE、图像模型）的独特优势，进行交叉验证和迭代优化，取长补短。

Um, you know, like I like with with Claude 4.5 sonnet, like I like with with Claude 4.5 sonnet, like I like with with Claude 4.5 sonnet, like I've taken um, you know, idea for a, like I've taken um, you know, idea for a, like I've taken um, you know, idea for a, SAS from from zero to production ready., SAS from from zero to production ready., SAS from from zero to production ready., So, you you can certainly do it um with, So, you you can certainly do it um with, So, you you can certainly do it um with, either of these models. Uh now what I, either of these models. Uh now what I, either of these models. Uh now what I, have personally found and to be clear I, have personally found and to be clear I, have personally found and to be clear I, haven't tried to build a full-on, haven't tried to build a full-on, haven't tried to build a full-on, application with Gemini 3 yet but um I, application with Gemini 3 yet but um I, application with Gemini 3 yet but um I, think that Claude's earlier models like, think that Claude's earlier models like, think that Claude's earlier models like, I would always go back to them like when, I would always go back to them like when, I would always go back to them like when, I was I I was trying to use codecs and, I was I I was trying to use codecs and, I was I I was trying to use codecs and, GPT5 before 5.1 came out and uh you know, GPT5 before 5.1 came out and uh you know, GPT5 before 5.1 came out and uh you know, Gemini 2.5 Pro and and stuff like that, Gemini 2.5 Pro and and stuff like that, Gemini 2.5 Pro and and stuff like that, and while the log logic is good and the, and while the log logic is good and the, and while the log logic is good and the, the thinking and the debugging is good., the thinking and the debugging is good., the thinking and the debugging is good., Um getting from, Um getting from, Um getting from, zero to fully ready was easier with the, zero to fully ready was easier with the, zero to fully ready was easier with the, claude models. Uh that that's just been, claude models. Uh that that's just been, claude models. Uh that that's just been, my experience. So I always kind of try, my experience. So I always kind of try, my experience. So I always kind of try, to lean on claude as the workhorse and, to lean on claude as the workhorse and, to lean on claude as the workhorse and, then have these other models doing what, then have these other models doing what, then have these other models doing what, they're good at as sort of a advisory, they're good at as sort of a advisory, they're good at as sort of a advisory, model if you if you will., model if you if you will., model if you if you will., So here they are like side by side.

Uh, &gt;&gt; and how to structure them. Uh, &gt;&gt; and how to structure them. Uh, but the the hardest part uh of building, but the the hardest part uh of building, but the the hardest part uh of building, a vertical app is figuring out what is, a vertical app is figuring out what is, a vertical app is figuring out what is, the workflow, figuring out what is the, the workflow, figuring out what is the, the workflow, figuring out what is the, social aspect. Um and then obviously, social aspect. Um and then obviously, social aspect. Um and then obviously, figuring out uh what is the vertical and, figuring out uh what is the vertical and, figuring out uh what is the vertical and, once you have these people in the, once you have these people in the, once you have these people in the, network then the workflow might change, network then the workflow might change, network then the workflow might change, but, but, but, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; there's some there is a workflow there, &gt;&gt; there's some there is a workflow there, &gt;&gt; there's some there is a workflow there, that you can, that you can, that you can, &gt;&gt; that you know you just have to figure, &gt;&gt; that you know you just have to figure, &gt;&gt; that you know you just have to figure, out what that is and if you don't know, out what that is and if you don't know, out what that is and if you don't know, what that is like you can show this to a, what that is like you can show this to a, what that is like you can show this to a, family right you now have a prototype, family right you now have a prototype, family right you now have a prototype, &gt;&gt; show it to them get feedback, &gt;&gt; show it to them get feedback, &gt;&gt; show it to them get feedback, &gt;&gt; um you could you know on idea browser we, &gt;&gt; um you could you know on idea browser we, &gt;&gt; um you could you know on idea browser we, have pro features that give you agents, have pro features that give you agents, have pro features that give you agents, to help you figure that out. Uh you, to help you figure that out. Uh you, to help you figure that out. Uh you, could you know just take it one step at, could you know just take it one step at, could you know just take it one step at, a time too. Suffer on retention, a time too. Suffer on retention, a time too. Suffer on retention, initially and then you know once you, initially and then you know once you, initially and then you know once you, have customers just like build build as, have customers just like build build as, have customers just like build build as, you go, you go, you go, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; um, &gt;&gt; um, &gt;&gt; um, &gt;&gt; right I think also uh you know maybe, &gt;&gt; right I think also uh you know maybe, &gt;&gt; right I think also uh you know maybe, the first customer isn't necessarily the, the first customer isn't necessarily the, the first customer isn't necessarily the, family. The first customer is maybe the, family. The first customer is maybe the, family. The first customer is maybe the, the probate attorney too., the probate attorney too., the probate attorney too., &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, like they've got the, &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, like they've got the, &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, like they've got the, clients coming all the time and uh you, clients coming all the time and uh you, clients coming all the time and uh you, know, they can it's kind of like the B2B, know, they can it's kind of like the B2B, know, they can it's kind of like the B2B, TOC model, if you will., TOC model, if you will., TOC model, if you will., &gt;&gt; Yeah., &gt;&gt; Yeah., &gt;&gt; Yeah., &gt;&gt; So, all right, let's see what uh AI, &gt;&gt; So, all right, let's see what uh AI, &gt;&gt; So, all right, let's see what uh AI, Studio is doing real quick and uh let's, Studio is doing real quick and uh let's, Studio is doing real quick and uh let's, get a gauge on. So, something that I've, get a gauge on. So, something that I've, get a gauge on. So, something that I've, noticed is there's there's a couple, noticed is there's there's a couple, noticed is there's there's a couple, errors here., errors here., errors here., &gt;&gt; So, what do you do when you see errors, &gt;&gt; So, what do you do when you see errors, &gt;&gt; So, what do you do when you see errors, like that?, like that?, like that?, uh fix error. How can you make this, uh fix error. How can you make this, uh fix error. How can you make this, work?, work?, work?, No. Um you know for for me it's yeah, No. Um you know for for me it's yeah, No. Um you know for for me it's yeah, just kind of a process of like trying to, just kind of a process of like trying to, just kind of a process of like trying to, dig deeper into what the root cause is., dig deeper into what the root cause is., dig deeper into what the root cause is., So I use ter the terminal for all of the, So I use ter the terminal for all of the, So I use ter the terminal for all of the, work that that I'm doing. So if we think, work that that I'm doing. So if we think, work that that I'm doing. So if we think, back to that cursor setup uh I may say, back to that cursor setup uh I may say, back to that cursor setup uh I may say, hey Claude uh ultra think about this uh, hey Claude uh ultra think about this uh, hey Claude uh ultra think about this uh, problem. you know, if you type in, problem. you know, if you type in, problem. you know, if you type in, ultrathink, it'll change colors and, ultrathink, it'll change colors and, ultrathink, it'll change colors and, it'll use more uh, you know, power to, it'll use more uh, you know, power to, it'll use more uh, you know, power to, kind of help to dig in or solve the, kind of help to dig in or solve the, kind of help to dig in or solve the, problem. Other tactics that I've used um, problem. Other tactics that I've used um, problem. Other tactics that I've used um, with Claude, because that's like my, with Claude, because that's like my, with Claude, because that's like my, daily workhorse, is I'll say, "Hey, if, daily workhorse, is I'll say, "Hey, if, daily workhorse, is I'll say, "Hey, if, I'm really stuck, I'll say, "Hey, spin, I'm really stuck, I'll say, "Hey, spin, I'm really stuck, I'll say, "Hey, spin, up specialized sub aents that are going, up specialized sub aents that are going, up specialized sub aents that are going, to go and find the root cause of why, to go and find the root cause of why, to go and find the root cause of why, this thing is breaking. Um, I need like, this thing is breaking. Um, I need like, this thing is breaking. Um, I need like, a Q&amp;A tester. I need a senior sort of, a Q&amp;A tester. I need a senior sort of, a Q&amp;A tester. I need a senior sort of, like engineer focus on this or whatever., like engineer focus on this or whatever., like engineer focus on this or whatever., And then it'll spin up these specialized, And then it'll spin up these specialized, And then it'll spin up these specialized, agents that'll identify different areas, agents that'll identify different areas, agents that'll identify different areas, that they're going to go and research in, that they're going to go and research in, that they're going to go and research in, the codebase. And then it'll come, the codebase. And then it'll come, the codebase. And then it'll come, together with like a comprehensive sort, together with like a comprehensive sort, together with like a comprehensive sort, of analysis for me. And then I can say, of analysis for me. And then I can say, of analysis for me. And then I can say, hey, all right, cool. Plan this in terms, hey, all right, cool. Plan this in terms, hey, all right, cool. Plan this in terms, of like a step-by-step process that we, of like a step-by-step process that we, of like a step-by-step process that we, can go through to fix it. If it's still, can go through to fix it. If it's still, can go through to fix it. If it's still, stuck, that's where I'll use cursor, stuck, that's where I'll use cursor, stuck, that's where I'll use cursor, agent with, you know, GPT or Gemini or, agent with, you know, GPT or Gemini or, agent with, you know, GPT or Gemini or, something like that for kind of an, something like that for kind of an, something like that for kind of an, outside perspective. Now, one of the the, outside perspective. Now, one of the the, outside perspective. Now, one of the the, things that Anthropic is kind of talking, things that Anthropic is kind of talking, things that Anthropic is kind of talking, about with Opus 4.5 is that its ability, about with Opus 4.5 is that its ability, about with Opus 4.5 is that its ability, to kind of stay on track is is really, to kind of stay on track is is really, to kind of stay on track is is really, powerful. Sometimes when the code base, powerful. Sometimes when the code base, powerful. Sometimes when the code base, grows, it's harder to kind of manage the, grows, it's harder to kind of manage the, grows, it's harder to kind of manage the, context to find what that single problem, context to find what that single problem, context to find what that single problem, or whatever uh is causing that's, or whatever uh is causing that's, or whatever uh is causing that's, breaking the the app. So, I haven't, breaking the the app. So, I haven't, breaking the the app. So, I haven't, built something full with with Opus 4.5, built something full with with Opus 4.5, built something full with with Opus 4.5, yet. I'm I'm thinking that its ability, yet. I'm I'm thinking that its ability, yet. I'm I'm thinking that its ability, to work through the bugs without sort of, to work through the bugs without sort of, to work through the bugs without sort of, getting lost is going to be a lot, getting lost is going to be a lot, getting lost is going to be a lot, stronger. Um, and I wouldn't maybe need, stronger. Um, and I wouldn't maybe need, stronger. Um, and I wouldn't maybe need, Ultra Think or Sub agents or maybe even, Ultra Think or Sub agents or maybe even, Ultra Think or Sub agents or maybe even, those additional agents on the side. So, those additional agents on the side. So, those additional agents on the side. So, I'm I'm really curious to dig into that, I'm I'm really curious to dig into that, I'm I'm really curious to dig into that, and see, and see, and see, &gt;&gt; which is a big deal.

Uh, similar, Um, let's see. Documents. Uh, similar, idea to what Claude came up with with, idea to what Claude came up with with, idea to what Claude came up with with, like document storage. Uh, we've got the, like document storage. Uh, we've got the, like document storage. Uh, we've got the, timeline here. I kind of liked I I think, timeline here. I kind of liked I I think, timeline here. I kind of liked I I think, the timeline's one of the core aspects, the timeline's one of the core aspects, the timeline's one of the core aspects, here of like getting that quick, here of like getting that quick, here of like getting that quick, snapshot. I liked how the 4.5 Opus had, snapshot. I liked how the 4.5 Opus had, snapshot. I liked how the 4.5 Opus had, that front and center as soon as you log, that front and center as soon as you log, that front and center as soon as you log, into the dashboard., into the dashboard., into the dashboard., Um we've got the family and we've got, Um we've got the family and we've got, Um we've got the family and we've got, settings., settings., settings., Um, Um, Um, my take is, my take is, my take is, I feel that, I feel that, I feel that, Opus went a little bit deeper, Opus went a little bit deeper, Opus went a little bit deeper, in terms of thinking through, in terms of thinking through, in terms of thinking through, the the product., I mean, this looks good. It's clean., I mean, this looks good. It's clean., It's not bad, but uh I think I like the, It's not bad, but uh I think I like the, It's not bad, but uh I think I like the, like the other version a little bit, like the other version a little bit, like the other version a little bit, better., better., better., Yeah, it feels a little more refined, Yeah, it feels a little more refined, Yeah, it feels a little more refined, a little deeper., a little deeper., a little deeper., Um, by the way, both of these products, Um, by the way, both of these products, Um, by the way, both of these products, are outstanding., are outstanding., are outstanding., &gt;&gt; Absolutely., &gt;&gt; Absolutely., &gt;&gt; Absolutely., &gt;&gt; MVPs, &gt;&gt; MVPs, &gt;&gt; MVPs, and we're only testing this with very, and we're only testing this with very, and we're only testing this with very, few prompts. So, few prompts. So, few prompts. So, &gt;&gt; it's unclear that at prompt 25 who would, &gt;&gt; it's unclear that at prompt 25 who would, &gt;&gt; it's unclear that at prompt 25 who would, be winning, be winning, be winning, &gt;&gt; right? But I think if you look at based, &gt;&gt; right? But I think if you look at based, &gt;&gt; right? But I think if you look at based, on the two prompts that we've done, I, on the two prompts that we've done, I, on the two prompts that we've done, I, think it's clear that it stayed clear on, think it's clear that it stayed clear on, think it's clear that it stayed clear on, 4.5 beat Gemini 3., 4.5 beat Gemini 3., 4.5 beat Gemini 3., &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I've got one other concept, &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I've got one other concept, &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I've got one other concept, here for a test just to try to make sure, here for a test just to try to make sure, here for a test just to try to make sure, that we're doing this, that we're doing this, that we're doing this, in a fair way., in a fair way., in a fair way., All right. So, um, anti-gravity, All right. So, um, anti-gravity, All right. So, um, anti-gravity, um, you know, Google's, uh, agentic IDE., um, you know, Google's, uh, agentic IDE., um, you know, Google's, uh, agentic IDE., I'm curious if we put the same prompt, I'm curious if we put the same prompt, I'm curious if we put the same prompt, into the Gemini 3 Pro model in, into the Gemini 3 Pro model in, into the Gemini 3 Pro model in, anti-gravity, anti-gravity, anti-gravity, if it is different than what you get in, if it is different than what you get in, if it is different than what you get in, AI Studio., AI Studio., AI Studio., &gt;&gt; I have a feeling I know the answer to, &gt;&gt; I have a feeling I know the answer to, &gt;&gt; I have a feeling I know the answer to, that, but I'm I I Let's try it., that, but I'm I I Let's try it., that, but I'm I I Let's try it., &gt;&gt; All right, we'll see what happens. My, &gt;&gt; All right, we'll see what happens. My, &gt;&gt; All right, we'll see what happens. My, hunch is that, hunch is that, hunch is that, it's you're going to get worse design, it's you're going to get worse design, it's you're going to get worse design, out of anti-gravity., out of anti-gravity., out of anti-gravity., &gt;&gt; Okay., &gt;&gt; Okay., &gt;&gt; Okay., &gt;&gt; But, you know, I've been wrong once and, &gt;&gt; But, you know, I've been wrong once and, &gt;&gt; But, you know, I've been wrong once and, I've been wrong before. I've been I've, I've been wrong before. I've been I've, I've been wrong before. I've been I've, been wrong lots of times. So, been wrong lots of times. So, been wrong lots of times. So, &gt;&gt; okay, &gt;&gt; okay, &gt;&gt; okay, let's check it out. And by the way, like, let's check it out. And by the way, like, let's check it out. And by the way, like, anti-gravity is really cool. Like, anti-gravity is really cool. Like, anti-gravity is really cool. Like, definitely, definitely, definitely, recommend people check it out. So, I'm, recommend people check it out. So, I'm, recommend people check it out. So, I'm, just going to paste in the same prompt, just going to paste in the same prompt, just going to paste in the same prompt, and let's see what happens., and let's see what happens., and let's see what happens., &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; So, why should people use anti-gravity over, why should people use anti-gravity over, why should people use anti-gravity over, a cursor?, a cursor?, a cursor?, &gt;&gt; Well, uh it's a good question. I mean, &gt;&gt; Well, uh it's a good question. I mean, &gt;&gt; Well, uh it's a good question. I mean, at the end of the day, they're both VS, at the end of the day, they're both VS, at the end of the day, they're both VS, Code forks, you know, so they're they're, Code forks, you know, so they're they're, Code forks, you know, so they're they're, both kind of based off of uh VS Code, um, both kind of based off of uh VS Code, um, both kind of based off of uh VS Code, um, which is open source and and free. Uh, which is open source and and free. Uh, which is open source and and free. Uh, however, I like some of the things, however, I like some of the things, however, I like some of the things, anti-gravity is working on. To be, anti-gravity is working on. To be, anti-gravity is working on. To be, honest, I've just started using it and, honest, I've just started using it and, honest, I've just started using it and, testing it and and things like that, but, testing it and and things like that, but, testing it and and things like that, but, they've got some like Chrome stuff built, they've got some like Chrome stuff built, they've got some like Chrome stuff built, in here u where uh it can access the, in here u where uh it can access the, in here u where uh it can access the, browser in a really easy way. And it can, browser in a really easy way. And it can, browser in a really easy way. And it can, even access you you install a Chrome, even access you you install a Chrome, even access you you install a Chrome, extension. So if if anyone's done vibe, extension. So if if anyone's done vibe, extension. So if if anyone's done vibe, coding in the past and you're trying to, coding in the past and you're trying to, coding in the past and you're trying to, like squash a bug, you know, you open up, like squash a bug, you know, you open up, like squash a bug, you know, you open up, uh your uh deployment, whether that's, uh your uh deployment, whether that's, uh your uh deployment, whether that's, locally or hosted or whatever, and you, locally or hosted or whatever, and you, locally or hosted or whatever, and you, know, your coding models like, hey, like, know, your coding models like, hey, like, know, your coding models like, hey, like, navigate to it on Chrome, and then open, navigate to it on Chrome, and then open, navigate to it on Chrome, and then open, up like the the console and the dev and, up like the the console and the dev and, up like the the console and the dev and, the dev tools and figure out like tell, the dev tools and figure out like tell, the dev tools and figure out like tell, me if if this API connection is working, me if if this API connection is working, me if if this API connection is working, copy paste the responses, like that, copy paste the responses, like that, copy paste the responses, like that, whole debugging process is is pretty, whole debugging process is is pretty, whole debugging process is is pretty, painful. So with the Chrome extension um, painful. So with the Chrome extension um, painful. So with the Chrome extension um, that anti-gravity connects to, it can, that anti-gravity connects to, it can, that anti-gravity connects to, it can, access that data for you, access that data for you, access that data for you, programmatically. So it's accessing the, programmatically. So it's accessing the, programmatically. So it's accessing the, DOM, it's seeing sort of the data behind, DOM, it's seeing sort of the data behind, DOM, it's seeing sort of the data behind, the scenes. So um you know, the scenes. So um you know, the scenes. So um you know, I I suspect it will greatly minimize the, I I suspect it will greatly minimize the, I I suspect it will greatly minimize the, back and forth in this debugging process, back and forth in this debugging process, back and forth in this debugging process, when it has a very tight uh browser, when it has a very tight uh browser, when it has a very tight uh browser, integration and can access data through, integration and can access data through, integration and can access data through, the anti-gravity extension. So I think, the anti-gravity extension. So I think, the anti-gravity extension. So I think, that's super interesting., that's super interesting., that's super interesting., Um, Um, Um, that that's kind of what the first thing, that that's kind of what the first thing, that that's kind of what the first thing, that I've really kind of picked up on, that I've really kind of picked up on, that I've really kind of picked up on, and noticed. Um, I I suspect given the, and noticed. Um, I I suspect given the, and noticed. Um, I I suspect given the, speed that Google's shipping, we're, speed that Google's shipping, we're, speed that Google's shipping, we're, going to see a lot of interesting things, going to see a lot of interesting things, going to see a lot of interesting things, here. Like some of the landing pages, here. Like some of the landing pages, here. Like some of the landing pages, I've I've built here, like I'm I'm, I've I've built here, like I'm I'm, I've I've built here, like I'm I'm, pretty sure you'll be able to have like, pretty sure you'll be able to have like, pretty sure you'll be able to have like, nano banana integrated within, nano banana integrated within, nano banana integrated within, anti-gravity and like some of these, anti-gravity and like some of these, anti-gravity and like some of these, other tools like you know like you want, other tools like you know like you want, other tools like you know like you want, a killer illustr illustration, great, a killer illustr illustration, great, a killer illustr illustration, great, like let's spin that up with with nano, like let's spin that up with with nano, like let's spin that up with with nano, banana and put on the, banana and put on the, banana and put on the, &gt;&gt; that's where it's going to go crazy, &gt;&gt; that's where it's going to go crazy, &gt;&gt; that's where it's going to go crazy, right? Cuz you see what's happening with, right? Cuz you see what's happening with, right? Cuz you see what's happening with, Google is they're creating V3. They're, Google is they're creating V3. They're, Google is they're creating V3. They're, creating Nana Banana. They're creating, creating Nana Banana. They're creating, creating Nana Banana. They're creating, all these like it's a whole creative, all these like it's a whole creative, all these like it's a whole creative, suite of killer use cases that are, suite of killer use cases that are, suite of killer use cases that are, pretty independent. But once they're, pretty independent. But once they're, pretty independent. But once they're, able to, you know, bring that into, able to, you know, bring that into, able to, you know, bring that into, anti-gravity, anti-gravity, anti-gravity, and and just use all the horsepower from, and and just use all the horsepower from, and and just use all the horsepower from, all those killer use case products, I, all those killer use case products, I, all those killer use case products, I, think uh it's going to be absolutely, think uh it's going to be absolutely, think uh it's going to be absolutely, madness. It's going to be really, madness. It's going to be really, madness. It's going to be really, awesome. And man, like, awesome. And man, like, awesome. And man, like, taking that even further, it's like, oh, taking that even further, it's like, oh, taking that even further, it's like, oh, like let's make a launch video, let's, like let's make a launch video, let's, like let's make a launch video, let's, make a podcast, like, make a podcast, like, make a podcast, like, &gt;&gt; like, you know, there's so many ways, &gt;&gt; like, you know, there's so many ways, &gt;&gt; like, you know, there's so many ways, that it can extend into the ecosystem., that it can extend into the ecosystem., that it can extend into the ecosystem., Um, I mean, you know, we talk a lot, Um, I mean, you know, we talk a lot, Um, I mean, you know, we talk a lot, about like via marketing stuff. Let's, about like via marketing stuff. Let's, about like via marketing stuff. Let's, set up a Google Ads campaign to drive, set up a Google Ads campaign to drive, set up a Google Ads campaign to drive, traffic to this. I mean like the ability, traffic to this. I mean like the ability, traffic to this. I mean like the ability, to to stay interconnected and and grow, to to stay interconnected and and grow, to to stay interconnected and and grow, lifetime value., lifetime value., lifetime value., No one can match that with this this, No one can match that with this this, No one can match that with this this, ecosystem that they have which is it's, ecosystem that they have which is it's, ecosystem that they have which is it's, wild., wild., wild., &gt;&gt; So what's happening?, &gt;&gt; So what's happening?, &gt;&gt; So what's happening?, &gt;&gt; Okay. So we put in the same prompt, &gt;&gt; Okay. So we put in the same prompt, &gt;&gt; Okay. So we put in the same prompt, uh here as well right now actually I, uh here as well right now actually I, uh here as well right now actually I, think it is generating a mockup with, think it is generating a mockup with, think it is generating a mockup with, nano banana., nano banana., nano banana., So it's actually generating an image, So it's actually generating an image, So it's actually generating an image, with nano banana instead of uh, with nano banana instead of uh, with nano banana instead of uh, going ahead and building the page from, going ahead and building the page from, going ahead and building the page from, from scratch. So okay here here's what, from scratch. So okay here here's what, from scratch. So okay here here's what, it's doing. It's generating a custom, it's doing. It's generating a custom, it's doing. It's generating a custom, dashboard mockup image first to make uh, dashboard mockup image first to make uh, dashboard mockup image first to make uh, the page look real. Then I'll build the, the page look real. Then I'll build the, the page look real. Then I'll build the, HTML file. Oo wow. So it used Nano, HTML file. Oo wow. So it used Nano, HTML file. Oo wow. So it used Nano, Banana. So, it's it's integrated uh to, Banana. So, it's it's integrated uh to, Banana.

Let's make sure, high fidelity mockup. Let's make sure, high fidelity mockup. Let's make sure, you like it before we go and write all, you like it before we go and write all, you like it before we go and write all, the code, you know?, the code, you know?, the code, you know?, &gt;&gt; Totally. Anti-gravity may surprise us, &gt;&gt; Totally. Anti-gravity may surprise us, &gt;&gt; Totally. Anti-gravity may surprise us, here., here., here., Okay, so here's another thing. Really, Okay, so here's another thing. Really, Okay, so here's another thing. Really, fast. Really fast is something I noticed, fast. Really fast is something I noticed, fast. Really fast is something I noticed, in anti-gravity., in anti-gravity., in anti-gravity., &gt;&gt; Um, let's let's open it up. I'm sure uh, &gt;&gt; Um, let's let's open it up. I'm sure uh, &gt;&gt; Um, let's let's open it up. I'm sure uh, the uh the hardcore developers and and, the uh the hardcore developers and and, the uh the hardcore developers and and, everything are going to be like, "What, everything are going to be like, "What, everything are going to be like, "What, are you doing?" But this is how I do it., are you doing?" But this is how I do it., are you doing?" But this is how I do it., All right. So, um I'm I've opened it up, All right. So, um I'm I've opened it up, All right. So, um I'm I've opened it up, uh in my browser., uh in my browser., uh in my browser., Let's check it out. So, this is, Let's check it out. So, this is, Let's check it out. So, this is, anti-gravity, anti-gravity, anti-gravity, Gemini 3 Pro. Uh, keep uh families, Gemini 3 Pro. Uh, keep uh families, Gemini 3 Pro. Uh, keep uh families, informed during probate. Stop the, informed during probate. Stop the, informed during probate. Stop the, endless phone calls. Estate clear gives, endless phone calls.

It's got the, family members instantly. It's got the, image that it created. So, again, this, image that it created. So, again, this, image that it created. So, again, this, is really cool how it's able to utilize, is really cool how it's able to utilize, is really cool how it's able to utilize, Nano Badana within the workflow, call it, Nano Badana within the workflow, call it, Nano Badana within the workflow, call it, as a tool, and implement it into your, as a tool, and implement it into your, as a tool, and implement it into your, design. like that is really neat. So, design. like that is really neat. So, design. like that is really neat. So, some similarities here between you know, some similarities here between you know, some similarities here between you know, some of the other ones in terms of, some of the other ones in terms of, some of the other ones in terms of, showing the features and stuff like, showing the features and stuff like, showing the features and stuff like, that, the pricing uh etc. So, I think, that, the pricing uh etc. So, I think, that, the pricing uh etc. So, I think, you know my take would be outside of, you know my take would be outside of, you know my take would be outside of, this image it feels a little basic. So I, this image it feels a little basic. So I, this image it feels a little basic. So I, I think your instinct that AI studio, I think your instinct that AI studio, I think your instinct that AI studio, will have a better initial design output, will have a better initial design output, will have a better initial design output, from one prompt was correct., from one prompt was correct., from one prompt was correct., I think what was cool about anti-gravity, I think what was cool about anti-gravity, I think what was cool about anti-gravity, and this whole sprint that we did with, and this whole sprint that we did with, and this whole sprint that we did with, it is if you scroll down the mockup, it is if you scroll down the mockup, it is if you scroll down the mockup, &gt;&gt; like for me how that mockup is and how, &gt;&gt; like for me how that mockup is and how, &gt;&gt; like for me how that mockup is and how, this how this is wireframed out there is, this how this is wireframed out there is, this how this is wireframed out there is, some alpha in there and then you know, some alpha in there and then you know, some alpha in there and then you know, maybe you go back to Opus 4.5 or maybe, maybe you go back to Opus 4.5 or maybe, maybe you go back to Opus 4.5 or maybe, you go back to Gemini 3 Pro on AI Studio, you go back to Gemini 3 Pro on AI Studio, you go back to Gemini 3 Pro on AI Studio, and then iterate there., and then iterate there., and then iterate there., &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. like what do you like, &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. like what do you like, &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. like what do you like, from each model like uh or whatever um, from each model like uh or whatever um, from each model like uh or whatever um, you know what can you learn from each, you know what can you learn from each, you know what can you learn from each, how can you sort of use it uh across the, how can you sort of use it uh across the, how can you sort of use it uh across the, the spectrum here to arrive at what you, the spectrum here to arrive at what you, the spectrum here to arrive at what you, what you like at the end of the day so, what you like at the end of the day so, what you like at the end of the day so, um really cool really cool so going back, um really cool really cool so going back, um really cool really cool so going back, to kind of like my setup a little bit, to kind of like my setup a little bit, to kind of like my setup a little bit, there are a few skills that I recommend, there are a few skills that I recommend, there are a few skills that I recommend, everyone create uh with with Claude Opus, everyone create uh with with Claude Opus, everyone create uh with with Claude Opus, so uh a skill is just like a set of, so uh a skill is just like a set of, so uh a skill is just like a set of, instructions that the model is going to, instructions that the model is going to, instructions that the model is going to, reference when it does a certain task., reference when it does a certain task., reference when it does a certain task., Okay, so I do a lot of like website, Okay, so I do a lot of like website, Okay, so I do a lot of like website, optimization for thevibemarketer.com.

So, you, know, as a as a small business or a, know, as a as a small business or a, know, as a as a small business or a, creator or whatever, like we don't need, creator or whatever, like we don't need, creator or whatever, like we don't need, to worry about like this empty brand, to worry about like this empty brand, to worry about like this empty brand, speak. We want to get people to take, speak. We want to get people to take, speak. We want to get people to take, action in in a classy way. Um, so I've, action in in a classy way. Um, so I've, action in in a classy way. Um, so I've, got a a direct response DNA, systems, got a a direct response DNA, systems, got a a direct response DNA, systems, over hacks, so that compound long-term, over hacks, so that compound long-term, over hacks, so that compound long-term, thinking, and then like a creator first, thinking, and then like a creator first, thinking, and then like a creator first, language, like you always talk about, language, like you always talk about, language, like you always talk about, like learning how to write for the, like learning how to write for the, like learning how to write for the, internet. I think like that's the, internet. I think like that's the, internet. I think like that's the, epitome of creator first language, like, epitome of creator first language, like, epitome of creator first language, like, you want to talk naturally, you know?, you want to talk naturally, you know?, you want to talk naturally, you know?, So blending what I learned from from, So blending what I learned from from, So blending what I learned from from, these uh folks with my own kind of DNA, these uh folks with my own kind of DNA, these uh folks with my own kind of DNA, uh kind of led me to you know creating, uh kind of led me to you know creating, uh kind of led me to you know creating, like my own voice skill and claude that, like my own voice skill and claude that, like my own voice skill and claude that, it that it uses every time. Uh so I, it that it uses every time. Uh so I, it that it uses every time. Uh so I, rebuilt like my entire website using, rebuilt like my entire website using, rebuilt like my entire website using, this and and it's been working pretty, this and and it's been working pretty, this and and it's been working pretty, well. So, um, definitely like leverage, well. So, um, definitely like leverage, well. So, um, definitely like leverage, skills and with the the tool use and the, skills and with the the tool use and the, skills and with the the tool use and the, context ability of 4.5, uh, it's going, context ability of 4.5, uh, it's going, context ability of 4.5, uh, it's going, to do a really good job with those. So, to do a really good job with those. So, to do a really good job with those. So, um, I boiled all that down, uh, also, um, I boiled all that down, uh, also, um, I boiled all that down, uh, also, into like a landing page architecture, into like a landing page architecture, into like a landing page architecture, that I utilize. So, I've been, you know, that I utilize. So, I've been, you know, that I utilize. So, I've been, you know, pumping out a lot of landing pages on my, pumping out a lot of landing pages on my, pumping out a lot of landing pages on my, website lately. Like, we've been doing, website lately. Like, we've been doing, website lately. Like, we've been doing, these like workshops. I wanted to create, these like workshops. I wanted to create, these like workshops. I wanted to create, like a lead magnet around those so that, like a lead magnet around those so that, like a lead magnet around those so that, I could gather emails. I wanted to, I could gather emails. I wanted to, I could gather emails. I wanted to, redesign the homepage and I use the same, redesign the homepage and I use the same, redesign the homepage and I use the same, architecture that cloud code was able to, architecture that cloud code was able to, architecture that cloud code was able to, reference uh on each and every page, reference uh on each and every page, reference uh on each and every page, using my voice. So uh this is sort of an, using my voice. So uh this is sort of an, using my voice. So uh this is sort of an, overview of of the architecture that I, overview of of the architecture that I, overview of of the architecture that I, use and probably a lot of other people, use and probably a lot of other people, use and probably a lot of other people, use whether they know it or not. So you, use whether they know it or not. So you, use whether they know it or not. So you, know we want to have like an impactful, know we want to have like an impactful, know we want to have like an impactful, hero section. Um you know what what is, hero section. Um you know what what is, hero section. Um you know what what is, this getting you? Uh what's sort of the, this getting you? Uh what's sort of the, this getting you? Uh what's sort of the, the transformation or the outcome? Um we, the transformation or the outcome? Um we, the transformation or the outcome? Um we, go through the problem agitate, go through the problem agitate, go through the problem agitate, uh phase. So this is sort of like what's, uh phase. So this is sort of like what's, uh phase. So this is sort of like what's, the issue you're facing? How do you, the issue you're facing? How do you, the issue you're facing? How do you, stoke the pain uh to to make it feel, stoke the pain uh to to make it feel, stoke the pain uh to to make it feel, like you really need something? And then, like you really need something? And then, like you really need something? And then, you're coming in with a solution. So, you're coming in with a solution. So, you're coming in with a solution. So, problem agitate solution is kind of a, problem agitate solution is kind of a, problem agitate solution is kind of a, classic uh framework for for conversion., classic uh framework for for conversion., classic uh framework for for conversion., Um we're providing the solution with, Um we're providing the solution with, Um we're providing the solution with, this like value stack. you know, took, this like value stack. you know, took, this like value stack. you know, took, that from sort of studying Hormos's, that from sort of studying Hormos's, that from sort of studying Hormos's, stuff where we're trying to make it feel, stuff where we're trying to make it feel, stuff where we're trying to make it feel, like we're giving you so much value that, like we're giving you so much value that, like we're giving you so much value that, it feels dumb to say no, right? And then, it feels dumb to say no, right? And then, it feels dumb to say no, right? And then, we follow up with social proof, uh, the, we follow up with social proof, uh, the, we follow up with social proof, uh, the, transformation, kind of backing up and, transformation, kind of backing up and, transformation, kind of backing up and, reselling this sort of major outcome, reselling this sort of major outcome, reselling this sort of major outcome, that you're going to get, having a, that you're going to get, having a, that you're going to get, having a, secondary strong CTA, and then, you, secondary strong CTA, and then, you, secondary strong CTA, and then, you, know, if you need like a footer or, know, if you need like a footer or, know, if you need like a footer or, anything like that. So, taking a step, anything like that. So, taking a step, anything like that. So, taking a step, back, I know that's a lot of, back, I know that's a lot of, back, I know that's a lot of, information. Um, one research like uh, information. Um, one research like uh, information. Um, one research like uh, the leaders in in your space, people you, the leaders in in your space, people you, the leaders in in your space, people you, look up to, people you think are doing a, look up to, people you think are doing a, look up to, people you think are doing a, good job.

Uh, you know, nail your own, sort of uh brand voice based on how you, sort of uh brand voice based on how you, sort of uh brand voice based on how you, naturally speak. Combine that into a, naturally speak. Combine that into a, naturally speak. Combine that into a, voice skill. Okay. And then, uh, you can, voice skill. Okay. And then, uh, you can, voice skill. Okay. And then, uh, you can, optimize that into sort of like your, optimize that into sort of like your, optimize that into sort of like your, landing page architecture that's driven, landing page architecture that's driven, landing page architecture that's driven, toward generating a conversion. And from, toward generating a conversion. And from, toward generating a conversion. And from, your experience playing with Opus 4.5 in, your experience playing with Opus 4.5 in, your experience playing with Opus 4.5 in, the last 24 hours, you're kind of, you, the last 24 hours, you're kind of, you, the last 24 hours, you're kind of, you, know, I know you shared some of some of, know, I know you shared some of some of, know, I know you shared some of some of, the landing pages and copy with me., the landing pages and copy with me., the landing pages and copy with me., You're you're basically suggesting that, You're you're basically suggesting that, You're you're basically suggesting that, you can get way better results., you can get way better results., you can get way better results., &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can get way better results uh, &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can get way better results uh, &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can get way better results uh, with with less prompting and less work, with with less prompting and less work, with with less prompting and less work, in between. So do the research up front, in between. So do the research up front, in between. So do the research up front, set up the skills, throw one prompt into, set up the skills, throw one prompt into, set up the skills, throw one prompt into, the system, and you'll get a great, the system, and you'll get a great, the system, and you'll get a great, result. So doing the the boring stuff up, result. So doing the the boring stuff up, result. So doing the the boring stuff up, front, if you will, doing the research, front, if you will, doing the research, front, if you will, doing the research, building these skills out, maybe you, building these skills out, maybe you, building these skills out, maybe you, have two or three, and then uh then, have two or three, and then uh then, have two or three, and then uh then, attacking uh the the project with just, attacking uh the the project with just, attacking uh the the project with just, one clear prompt can get you a long way., one clear prompt can get you a long way., one clear prompt can get you a long way., So um I'll I'll show you what that, So um I'll I'll show you what that, So um I'll I'll show you what that, means, and maybe we can even run it live, means, and maybe we can even run it live, means, and maybe we can even run it live, and and show people uh what this looks, and and show people uh what this looks, and and show people uh what this looks, like.

And then, you've got plug-in install front-end, you've got plug-in install front-end, you've got plug-in install front-end, design at Cloud Code plugins. So what, design at Cloud Code plugins. So what, design at Cloud Code plugins. So what, this is going to help Cloud Code do is, this is going to help Cloud Code do is, this is going to help Cloud Code do is, avoid all of that typical AI design, avoid all of that typical AI design, avoid all of that typical AI design, stuff. You know, we've seen it, stuff. You know, we've seen it, stuff. You know, we've seen it, everywhere. Uh everything looks the, everywhere. Uh everything looks the, everywhere. Uh everything looks the, same. You've got the the same gradients, same. You've got the the same gradients, same. You've got the the same gradients, the same text, all of that. So skills, the same text, all of that. So skills, the same text, all of that. So skills, are just like long sets of prompts or, are just like long sets of prompts or, are just like long sets of prompts or, instructions. So in there, Claude's own, instructions. So in there, Claude's own, instructions. So in there, Claude's own, team built this out. It's like avoid the, team built this out. It's like avoid the, team built this out. It's like avoid the, typical AI stuff, build pro production, typical AI stuff, build pro production, typical AI stuff, build pro production, grade designs and interfaces, etc. So, grade designs and interfaces, etc. So, grade designs and interfaces, etc. So, got all the instructions that you need, got all the instructions that you need, got all the instructions that you need, to to build out. So, I ran one prompt, to to build out. So, I ran one prompt, to to build out. So, I ran one prompt, uh with this uh I I was just imagining, uh with this uh I I was just imagining, uh with this uh I I was just imagining, uh kind of like a madeup offer like what, uh kind of like a madeup offer like what, uh kind of like a madeup offer like what, if I held like a workshop where I taught, if I held like a workshop where I taught, if I held like a workshop where I taught, people how to like build conversion, people how to like build conversion, people how to like build conversion, focused landing pages that look really, focused landing pages that look really, focused landing pages that look really, good or something like that. I put in a, good or something like that. I put in a, good or something like that. I put in a, two-line prompt and uh you know it sort, two-line prompt and uh you know it sort, two-line prompt and uh you know it sort, of oneshotted this which I think uh it, of oneshotted this which I think uh it, of oneshotted this which I think uh it, was a good first pass for for Claude, was a good first pass for for Claude, was a good first pass for for Claude, with the front-end design skill. Um, with the front-end design skill. Um, with the front-end design skill. Um, it's got, uh, you know, a clear, it's got, uh, you know, a clear, it's got, uh, you know, a clear, headline. It's got sort of stoking the, headline. It's got sort of stoking the, headline. It's got sort of stoking the, pain in a way. It's got kind of like the, pain in a way. It's got kind of like the, pain in a way. It's got kind of like the, transformation. It's got, you know, some, transformation. It's got, you know, some, transformation. It's got, you know, some, features, if you will. And then, uh, you, features, if you will. And then, uh, you, features, if you will. And then, uh, you, know, it's a very clean and and simple, know, it's a very clean and and simple, know, it's a very clean and and simple, design. Could obviously work on this, design. Could obviously work on this, design. Could obviously work on this, more and ask it to do a lot more things, more and ask it to do a lot more things, more and ask it to do a lot more things, but this one shot with one a one-s, but this one shot with one a one-s, but this one shot with one a one-s, sentence prompt is far better than what, sentence prompt is far better than what, sentence prompt is far better than what, most people are uh are doing out there., most people are uh are doing out there., most people are uh are doing out there., &gt;&gt; Yeah. and the copy hits, &gt;&gt; Yeah. and the copy hits, &gt;&gt; Yeah. and the copy hits, &gt;&gt; the the visuals don't look vibe coded at, &gt;&gt; the the visuals don't look vibe coded at, &gt;&gt; the the visuals don't look vibe coded at, all. It's easy to scan. I can imagine on, all. It's easy to scan. I can imagine on, all. It's easy to scan. I can imagine on, mobile that this would probably convert, mobile that this would probably convert, mobile that this would probably convert, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; pretty well. Um, &gt;&gt; pretty well. Um, &gt;&gt; pretty well. Um, &gt;&gt; yep., &gt;&gt; yep., &gt;&gt; yep., &gt;&gt; You know, I don't have too many notes on, &gt;&gt; You know, I don't have too many notes on, &gt;&gt; You know, I don't have too many notes on, it., it., it., &gt;&gt; Right. Right. I think like uh what I, &gt;&gt; Right. Right. I think like uh what I, &gt;&gt; Right. Right. I think like uh what I, would do, what I would say is, you know, would do, what I would say is, you know, would do, what I would say is, you know, I need a a better CTA kind of top of the, I need a a better CTA kind of top of the, I need a a better CTA kind of top of the, fold like what action do we want people, fold like what action do we want people, fold like what action do we want people, to take? uh social proof would also be, to take? uh social proof would also be, to take? uh social proof would also be, uh really good as well. But like you, uh really good as well. But like you, uh really good as well. But like you, know those two elements and you've got, know those two elements and you've got, know those two elements and you've got, something that you can literally create, something that you can literally create, something that you can literally create, in two or three minutes that's optimized, in two or three minutes that's optimized, in two or three minutes that's optimized, for conversion that sounds and looks, for conversion that sounds and looks, for conversion that sounds and looks, good., good., good., &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I think that the big piece, &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I think that the big piece, &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I think that the big piece, that people miss with vibe coding is, that people miss with vibe coding is, that people miss with vibe coding is, they vibe code stuff but then the copy, they vibe code stuff but then the copy, they vibe code stuff but then the copy, sucks., sucks., sucks., &gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. So then people, you know, &gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. So then people, you know, &gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. So then people, you know, they're they're converting at 1% or less, they're they're converting at 1% or less, they're they're converting at 1% or less, than 1% and they're like, why? And then, than 1% and they're like, why? And then, than 1% and they're like, why? And then, and they come to the conclusion that, and they come to the conclusion that, and they come to the conclusion that, oh, vibe coding, you know, doesn't work, oh, vibe coding, you know, doesn't work, oh, vibe coding, you know, doesn't work, for me., for me., for me., &gt;&gt; Exactly., &gt;&gt; Exactly., &gt;&gt; Exactly., &gt;&gt; Where it's like, well, you know, in a, &gt;&gt; Where it's like, well, you know, in a, &gt;&gt; Where it's like, well, you know, in a, lot of ways, the content is the UX. So, lot of ways, the content is the UX. So, lot of ways, the content is the UX. So, and what is the content? It's the words., and what is the content? It's the words., and what is the content? It's the words., And so if you can create great copy, And so if you can create great copy, And so if you can create great copy, you're going to probably be able to, you're going to probably be able to, you're going to probably be able to, convert even if the design isn't drop, convert even if the design isn't drop, convert even if the design isn't drop, dead gorgeous., dead gorgeous., dead gorgeous., &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. I mean, uh, look back, &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. I mean, uh, look back, &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. I mean, uh, look back, at the old school sales letters and, at the old school sales letters and, at the old school sales letters and, stuff like that, you know, from like, stuff like that, you know, from like, stuff like that, you know, from like, back in the day or like those old long, back in the day or like those old long, back in the day or like those old long, form newspaper ads. They aren't, form newspaper ads. They aren't, form newspaper ads. They aren't, necessarily beautiful. It's it's all, necessarily beautiful. It's it's all, necessarily beautiful. It's it's all, text, but they know how to influence and, text, but they know how to influence and, text, but they know how to influence and, talk about those pain points really, talk about those pain points really, talk about those pain points really, really well. And I think you point out a, really well. And I think you point out a, really well. And I think you point out a, really good good uh point here is like, really good good uh point here is like, really good good uh point here is like, everyone's focused on uh the design, everyone's focused on uh the design, everyone's focused on uh the design, aspect of of the aesthetic which is, aspect of of the aesthetic which is, aspect of of the aesthetic which is, important and we don't want like, important and we don't want like, important and we don't want like, something that looks the same as, something that looks the same as, something that looks the same as, everyone else but you know 98% of people, everyone else but you know 98% of people, everyone else but you know 98% of people, that are vibe coding or vibe building, that are vibe coding or vibe building, that are vibe coding or vibe building, are missing out on this whole copy angle, are missing out on this whole copy angle, are missing out on this whole copy angle, for sure. So, you know, that's the, for sure. So, you know, that's the, for sure. So, you know, that's the, episode. Opus 4.5 versus Gemini 3 Pro, episode. Opus 4.5 versus Gemini 3 Pro, episode. Opus 4.5 versus Gemini 3 Pro, with some bonus anti-gravity. What's, with some bonus anti-gravity. What's, with some bonus anti-gravity.

Um, I think if you level up, designs. Um, I think if you level up, designs. Um, I think if you level up, that design like we were talking about, that design like we were talking about, that design like we were talking about, with actual good copy that's geared, with actual good copy that's geared, with actual good copy that's geared, toward conversion, like you're going to, toward conversion, like you're going to, toward conversion, like you're going to, be you're going to be unstoppable. So, be you're going to be unstoppable. So, be you're going to be unstoppable.
