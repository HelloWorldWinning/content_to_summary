Description:
好的，这是对所提供文本的核心思想进行的提炼、总结和可视化。

### **内容概要大纲**

1.  **核心发布：Anthropic 推出 Claude Opus 4.5**
    *   **定位**：一款专为重型代理任务（heavy-duty agentic tasks）和高质量编码而设计的顶级 AI 模型。
    *   **宣称**：演讲者称其为“当前世界上最好的编码模型”。

2.  **性能与基准测试**
    *   **软件工程能力**：在 SWE-bench aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 测试中获得 80.9% 的高分，超越了包括 Gemini 3.0 Pro 在内的所有其他模型。
    *   **超越人类**：在 Anthropic 内部 2 小时的性能工程考试中，表现优于所有人类候选人。
    *   **多模态与推理**：在视觉、推理和数学方面有显著提升，并在多语言、浏览器任务等基准测试中取得顶尖成绩。
    *   **任务可靠性**：在长期任务可靠性方面比 Sonnet 4.5 高 29%，并能创造性地解决问题（如升级客舱等级以完成航班变更）。

3.  **模型规格与定价**
    *   **定价**：输入端每百万 token 5 美元，输出端每百万 token 25 美元，属于昂贵级别。
    *   **上下文窗口**：200k，与系列中其他模型相同，未升级到百万级。
    *   **最大输出**：64k token。

4.  **实战测试与能力评估**
    *   **SaaS 登陆页**：生成了超过 3000 行代码，功能完善（带动画、Cookie 横幅等），但前端设计风格较为普通。演讲者评分为 9/10。
    *   **SVG 蝴蝶**：生成了效果惊艳、带有交互动画的蝴蝶，表现优于 Gemini 3.0。
    *   **浏览器操作系统**：创建了一个功能齐全的模拟操作系统，包含文件浏览器、媒体播放器、计算器、终端乃至小游戏（贪吃蛇、扫雷），细节丰富，交互性强。
    *   **代理任务压力测试**：成功完成了克隆 GitHub 仓库、自动检测并修复代码错误、提交并推送修复、配置 CI/CD 文件的复杂端到端任务。
    *   **《我的世界》克隆**：生成了视觉效果不错的游戏克隆版，带有实时数据显示的 GUI，但移动功能在演示中未正常工作。

5.  **优缺点与结论**
    *   **绝对优势**：在后端工程、工具驱动的工作流和多步骤代理任务方面表现卓越，逻辑稳定可靠。
    *   **相对短板**：在前端开发方面可能不如更便宜的 Gemini 3.0。
    *   **推荐用法**：建议采用混合技术栈——使用 **Claude Opus 4.5 处理后端和复杂代理任务**，同时使用 **Gemini 3.0 负责前端开发**。

6.  **接入方式**
    *   官方 Claude Pro 订阅。
    *   通过 API 接入。
    *   使用 Kilo Code（VS Code 插件，提供免费额度）或 Open Router 等第三方平台。

### **核心观点**

Claude Opus 4.5 是一款专为复杂后端工程和自主代理任务设计的顶级编码模型，其强大的工具调用和问题解决能力使其在同类产品中脱颖而出，尽管在前端开发和成本方面需要权衡。

---

### **内容框架**

该内容的框架遵循“**发布介绍 → 性能分析 → 实战演示 → 综合评估**”的逻辑。首先介绍新模型及其市场定位，然后通过基准数据分析其硬实力，接着通过一系列具体的编码项目直观地展示其应用能力，最后结合优缺点和与竞品的对比，给出具有实践价值的综合性结论和使用建议。

Even Gemini 3.0 spends a lot, of time but you can see the amount of, of time but you can see the amount of, of time but you can see the amount of, lines of code it worked on generating, lines of code it worked on generating, lines of code it worked on generating, for the SAS landing page. Obviously, it, for the SAS landing page. Obviously, it, for the SAS landing page. Obviously, it, works a lot better with a coding agent, works a lot better with a coding agent, works a lot better with a coding agent, like Hilo Code, but you can see that, like Hilo Code, but you can see that, like Hilo Code, but you can see that, there is approximately over 1,400 lines, there is approximately over 1,400 lines, there is approximately over 1,400 lines, of code for just this front end. And, of code for just this front end. And, of code for just this front end. And, it's working on all the variables and, it's working on all the variables and, it's working on all the variables and, generating components for it to be, generating components for it to be, generating components for it to be, functional. And looks like it is still, functional. And looks like it is still, functional. And looks like it is still, generating the styles CSS file. And, generating the styles CSS file. And, generating the styles CSS file. And, there's over, I believe, 3,000 lines of, there's over, I believe, 3,000 lines of, there's over, I believe, 3,000 lines of, code. So, you can see how much effort, code. So, you can see how much effort, code. So, you can see how much effort, goes into generating all the components., But there we go. This is our SAS landing, But there we go. This is our SAS landing, page that it had generated. And it, page that it had generated. And it, page that it had generated. And it, actually looks pretty decent in my, actually looks pretty decent in my, actually looks pretty decent in my, opinion. There's animations. You also, opinion. There's animations. You also, opinion. There's animations. You also, have the cookie banner. And this is, have the cookie banner. And this is, have the cookie banner. And this is, overall something that it was able to, overall something that it was able to, overall something that it was able to, generate quite quickly. It added the, generate quite quickly. It added the, generate quite quickly. It added the, carousel for the trending companies, carousel for the trending companies, carousel for the trending companies, added animations to it, which is really, added animations to it, which is really, added animations to it, which is really, nice. So, it was able to meticulously, nice. So, it was able to meticulously, nice. So, it was able to meticulously, focus on every component really well., focus on every component really well., focus on every component really well., Its front-end capabilities are not the, Its front-end capabilities are not the, Its front-end capabilities are not the, best, I'll tell you that. It's not, best, I'll tell you that. It's not, best, I'll tell you that. It's not, better than Gemini 3.0. Maybe with, better than Gemini 3.0. Maybe with, better than Gemini 3.0. Maybe with, prompting it can get there. But you can, prompting it can get there. But you can, prompting it can get there. But you can, see that the small things a part of this, see that the small things a part of this, see that the small things a part of this, model is what makes it a proficient, model is what makes it a proficient, model is what makes it a proficient, model that you would want to use for, model that you would want to use for, model that you would want to use for, development. Overall, it did a great job, development. Overall, it did a great job, development. Overall, it did a great job, in my opinion with this SAS landing, in my opinion with this SAS landing, in my opinion with this SAS landing, page. I would give it a 9 out of 10, page. I would give it a 9 out of 10, page. I would give it a 9 out of 10, overall with its functionality. But with, overall with its functionality. But with, overall with its functionality. But with, this front end style, it's still the, this front end style, it's still the, this front end style, it's still the, basic typical AI generated uh front end, basic typical AI generated uh front end, basic typical AI generated uh front end, style, which is not horrible, but you, style, which is not horrible, but you, style, which is not horrible, but you, can see how interactive and how thorough, can see how interactive and how thorough, can see how interactive and how thorough, it was able to generate each component., it was able to generate each component., it was able to generate each component., It just keeps going and it did overall a, It just keeps going and it did overall a, It just keeps going and it did overall a, great job. All of these small features, great job. All of these small features, great job. All of these small features, makes it perfect in my opinion. With the, makes it perfect in my opinion. With the, makes it perfect in my opinion. With the, dark mode, it looks a lot better in my, dark mode, it looks a lot better in my, dark mode, it looks a lot better in my, opinion, too. And you can see how much, opinion, too. And you can see how much, opinion, too. And you can see how much, effort it put into each component. Also, effort it put into each component. Also, effort it put into each component. Also, another thing you'll notice is that its, another thing you'll notice is that its, another thing you'll notice is that its, browser use component is a lot better in, browser use component is a lot better in, browser use component is a lot better in, comparison to previous models. This is, comparison to previous models. This is, comparison to previous models. This is, where it can debug and test a lot, where it can debug and test a lot, where it can debug and test a lot, better. It's obviously going to be a lot, better. It's obviously going to be a lot, better. It's obviously going to be a lot, more expensive where it took $2.55 to, more expensive where it took $2.55 to, more expensive where it took $2.55 to, generate the SAS landing page, but in, generate the SAS landing page, but in, generate the SAS landing page, but in, terms of its overall quality and using, terms of its overall quality and using, terms of its overall quality and using, the browser use agent, it is going to be, the browser use agent, it is going to be, the browser use agent, it is going to be, really helpful in finding and testing, really helpful in finding and testing, really helpful in finding and testing, bugs. In my next test, I had requested, bugs. In my next test, I had requested, bugs. In my next test, I had requested, the Opus 4.5 to generate an SOG of a, the Opus 4.5 to generate an SOG of a, the Opus 4.5 to generate an SOG of a, butterfly, and this is where it did, butterfly, and this is where it did, butterfly, and this is where it did, this. This is incredible, guys. In my, this. This is incredible, guys. In my, this. This is incredible, guys. In my, opinion, this is better than the, opinion, this is better than the, opinion, this is better than the, generation I saw of the Gemini 3.0. It, generation I saw of the Gemini 3.0. It, generation I saw of the Gemini 3.0. It, was able to create a really cool looking, was able to create a really cool looking, was able to create a really cool looking, butterfly. I didn't even tell it to, butterfly. I didn't even tell it to, butterfly. I didn't even tell it to, create animations for it, but it had, create animations for it, but it had, create animations for it, but it had, done that on its own. And it's, done that on its own. And it's, done that on its own. And it's, interactive. It made sure uh all of the, interactive. It made sure uh all of the, interactive. It made sure uh all of the, components are symmetrical and it did a, components are symmetrical and it did a, components are symmetrical and it did a, great job overall in generating this., great job overall in generating this., great job overall in generating this., Next up, I'm requesting it to create a, Next up, I'm requesting it to create a, Next up, I'm requesting it to create a, browserbased operating system. And you, browserbased operating system. And you, browserbased operating system. And you, can see that it is working on generating, can see that it is working on generating, can see that it is working on generating, the plan for it. Essentially, we're, the plan for it. Essentially, we're, the plan for it. Essentially, we're, trying to see how well it is in terms of, trying to see how well it is in terms of, trying to see how well it is in terms of, proficiently generating this application, proficiently generating this application, proficiently generating this application, and how it's able to code out all the, and how it's able to code out all the, and how it's able to code out all the, components. So, spent approximately, components. So, spent approximately, components. So, spent approximately, $1.70 to generate the landing page. And, $1.70 to generate the landing page. And, $1.70 to generate the landing page. And, this is essentially how it looks. Go, this is essentially how it looks. Go, this is essentially how it looks. Go, ahead and open it up. You have a loading, ahead and open it up. You have a loading, ahead and open it up. You have a loading, animation to start up the operating, animation to start up the operating, animation to start up the operating, system, which is absolutely awesome. We, system, which is absolutely awesome. We, system, which is absolutely awesome. We, can go ahead and sign in by clicking, can go ahead and sign in by clicking, can go ahead and sign in by clicking, enter. And there we go. This is our, enter. And there we go. This is our, enter. And there we go. This is our, browserbased OS, which actually looks, browserbased OS, which actually looks, browserbased OS, which actually looks, pretty good in my opinion. You have, pretty good in my opinion. You have, pretty good in my opinion. You have, better icons in terms of SVG. It did a, better icons in terms of SVG. It did a, better icons in terms of SVG. It did a, great job in generating these different, great job in generating these different, great job in generating these different, icons. You have the file explorer, which, icons. You have the file explorer, which, icons. You have the file explorer, which, actually works, and this is actually, actually works, and this is actually, actually works, and this is actually, great. And you can actually open up, great. And you can actually open up, great. And you can actually open up, these different individual applications., these different individual applications., these different individual applications., There is documents, downloads. All these, There is documents, downloads. All these, There is documents, downloads. All these, components have been fully thoroughly, components have been fully thoroughly, components have been fully thoroughly, generated. You have the media player, generated. You have the media player, generated. You have the media player, which looks awesome. I don't believe, which looks awesome. I don't believe, which looks awesome. I don't believe, this is going to work, but it looks a, this is going to work, but it looks a, this is going to work, but it looks a, lot better than what I saw previously, lot better than what I saw previously, lot better than what I saw previously, with other models. You have a paint. All, with other models. You have a paint. All, with other models. You have a paint. All, these are functional apps that have been, these are functional apps that have been, these are functional apps that have been, generated, which is just awesome., generated, which is just awesome., generated, which is just awesome., Notepad works. The calculator also, Notepad works. The calculator also, Notepad works. The calculator also, works. You also have a weather app, works. You also have a weather app, works. You also have a weather app, which is great to see. You even have a, which is great to see. You even have a, which is great to see. You even have a, terminal and this terminal will actually, terminal and this terminal will actually, terminal and this terminal will actually, function as well. You have a calendar., function as well. You have a calendar., function as well. You have a calendar., You have a browser which is really great, You have a browser which is really great, You have a browser which is really great, to see and it actually prompts you to, to see and it actually prompts you to, to see and it actually prompts you to, open it up within another uh prompt, open it up within another uh prompt, open it up within another uh prompt, within your web browser. There's a, within your web browser. There's a, within your web browser. There's a, settings tab where you can change the, settings tab where you can change the, settings tab where you can change the, personalization. You can change the, personalization. You can change the, personalization. You can change the, wallpaper which is pretty cool in my, wallpaper which is pretty cool in my, wallpaper which is pretty cool in my, opinion. So you can see how meticulous, opinion. So you can see how meticulous, opinion. So you can see how meticulous, it was in terms of generating all of, it was in terms of generating all of, it was in terms of generating all of, these components, which is just great to, these components, which is just great to, these components, which is just great to, see. There's a snake game that also, see. There's a snake game that also, see. There's a snake game that also, generated directly within the game. And, generated directly within the game. And, generated directly within the game. And, I believe you can actually interact with, I believe you can actually interact with, I believe you can actually interact with, it, which is just wild to me. You also, it, which is just wild to me. You also, it, which is just wild to me. You also, have mind sweeper, which it also, have mind sweeper, which it also, have mind sweeper, which it also, generated. And there's different levels, generated. And there's different levels, generated. And there's different levels, to this. So in my opinion, this is just, to this. So in my opinion, this is just, to this. So in my opinion, this is just, impressive cuz each detail has been, impressive cuz each detail has been, impressive cuz each detail has been, meticulously generated. You can see, meticulously generated. You can see, meticulously generated. You can see, there's a tab section. There's also the, there's a tab section. There's also the, there's a tab section. There's also the, actual Windows brow or not Windows but, actual Windows brow or not Windows but, actual Windows brow or not Windows but, you have that uh window that pops up, you have that uh window that pops up, you have that uh window that pops up, whenever you click the main settings tab, whenever you click the main settings tab, whenever you click the main settings tab, and you can log off, you can restart it, and you can log off, you can restart it, and you can log off, you can restart it, you can lock your device. So each, you can lock your device. So each, you can lock your device. So each, component has been thoroughly generated, component has been thoroughly generated, component has been thoroughly generated, and in my opinion this model is actually, and in my opinion this model is actually, and in my opinion this model is actually, the best coding model that I've seen for, the best coding model that I've seen for, the best coding model that I've seen for, backend related tasks. So, in my, backend related tasks. So, in my, backend related tasks. So, in my, opinion, the new tech stack that I would, opinion, the new tech stack that I would, opinion, the new tech stack that I would, work with is having Claude Opus 4.5, work with is having Claude Opus 4.5, work with is having Claude Opus 4.5, powering my backend related tasks and, powering my backend related tasks and, powering my backend related tasks and, using front-end capabilities of Gemini, using front-end capabilities of Gemini, using front-end capabilities of Gemini, 3.0. And with the combination of the, 3.0. And with the combination of the, 3.0. And with the combination of the, two, you're going to be able to generate, two, you're going to be able to generate, two, you're going to be able to generate, a lot of great things with these two, a lot of great things with these two, a lot of great things with these two, models. Next up, I really want to test, models. Next up, I really want to test, models. Next up, I really want to test, the stress test of this model by using a, the stress test of this model by using a, the stress test of this model by using a, prompt like working on multiple subtests, prompt like working on multiple subtests, prompt like working on multiple subtests, where it's going to test the model's end, where it's going to test the model's end, where it's going to test the model's end, to end agentic dev skills. This is where, to end agentic dev skills. This is where, to end agentic dev skills. This is where, we're testing how agentic it is and how, we're testing how agentic it is and how, we're testing how agentic it is and how, it can orchestrate multiple tools. We, it can orchestrate multiple tools. We, it can orchestrate multiple tools. We, know this model is really good with tool, know this model is really good with tool, know this model is really good with tool, calling. So I want to see how well it is, calling. So I want to see how well it is, calling. So I want to see how well it is, in terms of performing this task where, in terms of performing this task where, in terms of performing this task where, it can clone a public GitHub repository, it can clone a public GitHub repository, it can clone a public GitHub repository, for a simple web app. Run and build test, for a simple web app. Run and build test, for a simple web app. Run and build test, commands in the shell. If the tests are, commands in the shell. If the tests are, commands in the shell. If the tests are, failing or lint errors, fix them, failing or lint errors, fix them, failing or lint errors, fix them, automatically. Commit your fixes and, automatically. Commit your fixes and, automatically. Commit your fixes and, push them back. Then set up the basic CI, push them back. Then set up the basic CI, push them back. Then set up the basic CI, config files and then generate the brief, config files and then generate the brief, config files and then generate the brief, summary. So essentially, we're having it, summary. So essentially, we're having it, summary. So essentially, we're having it, run down on understanding the code, run down on understanding the code, run down on understanding the code, fixing failures, producing different, fixing failures, producing different, fixing failures, producing different, changes with minimal human prompting, changes with minimal human prompting, changes with minimal human prompting, which is where I wanted to see how well, which is where I wanted to see how well, which is where I wanted to see how well, it is in terms of performing all these, it is in terms of performing all these, it is in terms of performing all these, specific actions from automated, specific actions from automated, specific actions from automated, debugging to CI/CD configuration to also, debugging to CI/CD configuration to also, debugging to CI/CD configuration to also, different tool orchestrations and web, different tool orchestrations and web, different tool orchestrations and web, search use cases. We're going to see how, search use cases. We're going to see how, search use cases. We're going to see how, robust it is with a prompt like this. So, robust it is with a prompt like this. So, robust it is with a prompt like this. So, it looks like it has finished, it looks like it has finished, it looks like it has finished, accomplishing this task and you can see, accomplishing this task and you can see, accomplishing this task and you can see, that it was able to clone the repository, that it was able to clone the repository, that it was able to clone the repository, which it did. It was able to run the, which it did. It was able to run the, which it did. It was able to run the, build test and it was able to see what, build test and it was able to see what, build test and it was able to see what, sort of errors it found. It fixed them, sort of errors it found. It fixed them, sort of errors it found. It fixed them, automatically like the issues amongst, automatically like the issues amongst, automatically like the issues amongst, all of these different files and it was, all of these different files and it was, all of these different files and it was, able to resolve all of them. And at the, able to resolve all of them. And at the, able to resolve all of them. And at the, end you can see the pull request list, end you can see the pull request list, end you can see the pull request list, that it had generated which is great to, that it had generated which is great to, that it had generated which is great to, see. And at the end there's also the, see. And at the end there's also the, see. And at the end there's also the, different branch that it created with, different branch that it created with, different branch that it created with, all the edits and the final test results, all the edits and the final test results, all the edits and the final test results, it was able to uh list. Now within open, it was able to uh list. Now within open, it was able to uh list. Now within open, router I had prompted to create a, router I had prompted to create a, router I had prompted to create a, Minecraft clone and this is what I have, Minecraft clone and this is what I have, Minecraft clone and this is what I have, gotten. I have gotten the control list., gotten. I have gotten the control list., gotten. I have gotten the control list., I can click enter and this is the, I can click enter and this is the, I can click enter and this is the, Minecraft clone which actually looks, Minecraft clone which actually looks, Minecraft clone which actually looks, pretty good in my opinion. Now, in terms, pretty good in my opinion. Now, in terms, pretty good in my opinion. Now, in terms, of the functions though, it's not, of the functions though, it's not, of the functions though, it's not, working as I want it to be, which is, working as I want it to be, which is, working as I want it to be, which is, kind of unfortunate, but I guess you can, kind of unfortunate, but I guess you can, kind of unfortunate, but I guess you can, place down blocks, which is kind of, place down blocks, which is kind of, place down blocks, which is kind of, great to see. It added a great, great to see. It added a great, great to see. It added a great, atmosphere and terrain. And what you can, atmosphere and terrain. And what you can, atmosphere and terrain. And what you can, see is if you're turning around, there's, see is if you're turning around, there's, see is if you're turning around, there's, an interactive GUI at the top left that, an interactive GUI at the top left that, an interactive GUI at the top left that, showcases the FPS that's actually, showcases the FPS that's actually, showcases the FPS that's actually, showcasing the live view of it, the, showcasing the live view of it, the, showcasing the live view of it, the, facing direction, as well as a couple, facing direction, as well as a couple, facing direction, as well as a couple, other things like the chunk and the, other things like the chunk and the, other things like the chunk and the, ground.
