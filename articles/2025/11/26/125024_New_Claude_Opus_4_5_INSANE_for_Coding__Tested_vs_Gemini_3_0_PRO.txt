Description:
好的，这是对所提供文本内容的提炼、总结和可视化。

### **内容概要及核心思想**

#### **一、核心发布与主要论点**

*   **核心事件：** Anthropic公司发布了其最新的AI模型——Claude Opus 4.5。
*   **主要论点：** 该模型被誉为当前最强大的编码AI模型，其综合能力在多个维度上超越了包括Gemini 3 Pro和GPT-5.1在内的主要竞争对手。

#### **二、多维度论证依据**

1.  **量化基准测试 (Quantitative Benchmarks):**
    *   **SWE-bench (软件工程基准):** Opus 4.5 在被视为“编码圣杯”的测试中表现出色，该测试衡量AI自主修复真实GitHub问题的能力。
    *   **Agentic Coding & Tool Use (智能体编码与工具使用):** 在执行终端命令、连续使用多种工具完成复杂任务方面表现优异。
    *   **Novel Problem Solving (新问题解决能力):** 在类似于IQ测试的Arc AGI2基准中得分很高，展示了其强大的抽象推理能力。

2.  **实际应用评估 (Practical Application & Evaluation):**
    *   **Next.js 框架测试:**
        *   **效率优势:** 尽管成功率与竞品相当，但Opus 4.5完成任务的平均耗时更短，消耗的Tokens显著减少，这意味着它**更快、更经济**。
    *   **网站重建对比测试:**
        *   **质量优势:** 使用完全相同的提示词，Opus 4.5 从零开始构建的网站（包括登录页、定价页、仪表盘等），在**设计美感、布局合理性和整体完成度上，都远超Gemini 3 Pro**的生成结果。

3.  **官方报告与社区反馈 (Official Report & Community Feedback):**
    *   **Anthropic官方文章:** 强调了模型不仅智能，而且更安全（能更好地抵抗提示注入攻击），并通过案例展示了其解决问题的效率。
    *   **社交媒体初步反馈 (X Posts):** 社区普遍反响积极，GitHub等平台已集成该模型。但在一些创意生成任务（如3D渲染）上，与竞品相比各有千秋，结果并非绝对领先。

### **核心结论 (Core Point)**

Claude Opus 4.5 凭借其在编码基准测试中的卓越表现、更高的运行效率以及在实际网页开发任务中压倒性的输出质量，被认为是当前编码领域的顶级AI模型。

### **内容 overarching 框架**

该内容采用了一种层层递进的“**论点-证据**”框架来全面评估新发布的Claude Opus 4.5模型。它首先抛出一个强有力的核心论点（“史上最佳编码模型”），然后从四个不同层面系统地提供证据来支撑这一论点：
1.  **客观量化数据：** 引用多个行业标准基准测试的领先分数。
2.  **效率应用分析：** 通过具体的框架测试来证明其速度和成本优势。
3.  **直观效果对比：** 进行一个“同题作答”的实践项目，直观展示其最终产出的质量优势。
4.  **市场综合反馈：** 结合官方解读和初步的社区舆论，形成一个完整的评价闭环。

这种结构从抽象数据到具体实践，再到市场反响，为论点构建了坚实且有说服力的支撑体系。

Honestly, like, like real life issues. Honestly, like, like real life issues. Honestly, like, five 10 tests wouldn't be enough to, five 10 tests wouldn't be enough to, five 10 tests wouldn't be enough to, actually evaluate the model. And that is, actually evaluate the model. And that is, actually evaluate the model. And that is, why we have the SWEV bench verified., why we have the SWEV bench verified., why we have the SWEV bench verified., This tests if AI can autonomously fix, This tests if AI can autonomously fix, This tests if AI can autonomously fix, real GitHub issues from open- source, real GitHub issues from open- source, real GitHub issues from open- source, repos and that's why this benchmark is, repos and that's why this benchmark is, repos and that's why this benchmark is, kind of the holy grail to decide which, kind of the holy grail to decide which, kind of the holy grail to decide which, is the best coding model. This matters, is the best coding model. This matters, is the best coding model. This matters, because it measures realworld software, because it measures realworld software, because it measures realworld software, engineering capability. Now let's move, engineering capability. Now let's move, engineering capability. Now let's move, on to the agentic terminal coding. This, on to the agentic terminal coding. This, on to the agentic terminal coding. This, benchmark is really important to measure, benchmark is really important to measure, benchmark is really important to measure, how good a model is to perform these, how good a model is to perform these, how good a model is to perform these, types of tasks. As you can see, it tried, types of tasks. As you can see, it tried, types of tasks. As you can see, it tried, to execute some different commands here, to execute some different commands here, to execute some different commands here, and weak like weak models in doing this, and weak like weak models in doing this, and weak like weak models in doing this, would take a lot of time and a lot of, would take a lot of time and a lot of, would take a lot of time and a lot of, tokens and a lot of context necessary to, tokens and a lot of context necessary to, tokens and a lot of context necessary to, produce the correct command. So, this is, produce the correct command. So, this is, produce the correct command. So, this is, really important for whoever is either, really important for whoever is either, really important for whoever is either, vibe coding or agentic coding and Opus, vibe coding or agentic coding and Opus, vibe coding or agentic coding and Opus, 4.5 is absolutely smashing at this as, 4.5 is absolutely smashing at this as, 4.5 is absolutely smashing at this as, well. Then we have the T2 bench which is, well. Then we have the T2 bench which is, well. Then we have the T2 bench which is, the agentic tool use. This measures how, the agentic tool use. This measures how, the agentic tool use. This measures how, well models can use multiple tools in, well models can use multiple tools in, well models can use multiple tools in, sequence to complete complex multi-step, sequence to complete complex multi-step, sequence to complete complex multi-step, tasks. Important for evaluating AI, tasks. Important for evaluating AI, tasks. Important for evaluating AI, agents that need to chain actions, agents that need to chain actions, agents that need to chain actions, together. So pretty self-intuitive is, together. So pretty self-intuitive is, together. So pretty self-intuitive is, also really important for whoever's, also really important for whoever's, also really important for whoever's, coding inside a platform like cloud code, coding inside a platform like cloud code, coding inside a platform like cloud code, cursor or whatever. Now the skilled tool, cursor or whatever. Now the skilled tool, cursor or whatever. Now the skilled tool, use or MCP atlas. The MCP atlas tests, use or MCP atlas. The MCP atlas tests, use or MCP atlas. The MCP atlas tests, tool use at skill with the model context, tool use at skill with the model context, tool use at skill with the model context, protocol. So, I guess it's about how, protocol. So, I guess it's about how, protocol. So, I guess it's about how, good the model is in using not only, good the model is in using not only, good the model is in using not only, MCPS, but I'd say like Claude's skills, MCPS, but I'd say like Claude's skills, MCPS, but I'd say like Claude's skills, maybe comes in here. And apparently, maybe comes in here. And apparently, maybe comes in here. And apparently, Claude is the only one really measuring, Claude is the only one really measuring, Claude is the only one really measuring, this since it's only measured in their, this since it's only measured in their, this since it's only measured in their, own models. And it absolutely smashed, own models. And it absolutely smashed, own models. And it absolutely smashed, the other models by like nearly 20%, the other models by like nearly 20%, the other models by like nearly 20%, more. Speaking of which, the computer, more. Speaking of which, the computer, more. Speaking of which, the computer, use also only measured from the cloud, use also only measured from the cloud, use also only measured from the cloud, models. Let's take a look at what this, models. Let's take a look at what this, models. Let's take a look at what this, benchmark actually does. So the OS world, benchmark actually does. So the OS world, benchmark actually does. So the OS world, or computer use benchmarks AI, or computer use benchmarks AI, or computer use benchmarks AI, controlling a full desktop environment., controlling a full desktop environment., controlling a full desktop environment., Clicking, typing, navigating apps, Clicking, typing, navigating apps, Clicking, typing, navigating apps, measures whether models can complete, measures whether models can complete, measures whether models can complete, real computer tasks like a human would., real computer tasks like a human would., real computer tasks like a human would., At least for now, this isn't that useful, At least for now, this isn't that useful, At least for now, this isn't that useful, for us. But as more tools like the, for us. But as more tools like the, for us. But as more tools like the, anti-gravity from Google comes in where, anti-gravity from Google comes in where, anti-gravity from Google comes in where, you can actually have the LLM access, you can actually have the LLM access, you can actually have the LLM access, your browser, then yeah, the more this, your browser, then yeah, the more this, your browser, then yeah, the more this, will become really necessary. And I'd, will become really necessary. And I'd, will become really necessary. And I'd, actually guess that if Gemini Pro tested, actually guess that if Gemini Pro tested, actually guess that if Gemini Pro tested, this, it would have an even better, this, it would have an even better, this, it would have an even better, percentage. Yeah, I'm not really sure., percentage. Yeah, I'm not really sure., percentage. Yeah, I'm not really sure., Now, as for the novel problem solving, Now, as for the novel problem solving, Now, as for the novel problem solving, Arc AGI2 verified, what this does is, Arc AGI2 verified, what this does is, Arc AGI2 verified, what this does is, tests abstract reasoning on puzzles that, tests abstract reasoning on puzzles that, tests abstract reasoning on puzzles that, the model has never seen. Specifically, the model has never seen. Specifically, the model has never seen. Specifically, designed to resist memorization, designed to resist memorization, designed to resist memorization, requires genuine generalization and, requires genuine generalization and, requires genuine generalization and, pattern recognition. So yeah, we can say, pattern recognition. So yeah, we can say, pattern recognition. So yeah, we can say, this is basically an IQ test and Claude, this is basically an IQ test and Claude, this is basically an IQ test and Claude, could say it has the smartest model, could say it has the smartest model, could say it has the smartest model, alive. But yeah, we checked the, alive. But yeah, we checked the, alive. But yeah, we checked the, benchmarks. Now let's see how this model, benchmarks. Now let's see how this model, benchmarks. Now let's see how this model, reacts inside of a NextJS build. So, reacts inside of a NextJS build. So, reacts inside of a NextJS build. So, whoever is building full stack, whoever is building full stack, whoever is building full stack, applications using an XJS will benefit, applications using an XJS will benefit, applications using an XJS will benefit, from these evaluations. And we can check, from these evaluations. And we can check, from these evaluations. And we can check, that both inside of the evals from, that both inside of the evals from, that both inside of the evals from, nexjs.org/evol org/evol, nexjs.org/evol org/evol, nexjs.org/evol org/evol, and we can also run that project on our, and we can also run that project on our, and we can also run that project on our, own computer and test any given model., own computer and test any given model., own computer and test any given model., The thing is every time you run this you, The thing is every time you run this you, The thing is every time you run this you, might get a different result. Ideally it, might get a different result. Ideally it, might get a different result. Ideally it, will aim towards a specific like range, will aim towards a specific like range, will aim towards a specific like range, so it won't go too far from 40%. Now in, so it won't go too far from 40%. Now in, so it won't go too far from 40%. Now in, this test from nextjs the success rate, this test from nextjs the success rate, this test from nextjs the success rate, was 40%. But in my own test, it was 42%., was 40%. But in my own test, it was 42%., was 40%. But in my own test, it was 42%., Which is the same result that Google, Which is the same result that Google, Which is the same result that Google, Gemini 3 Pro preview got as well as the, Gemini 3 Pro preview got as well as the, Gemini 3 Pro preview got as well as the, OpenAI GT5.1 Codeex. What you can notice, OpenAI GT5.1 Codeex. What you can notice, OpenAI GT5.1 Codeex. What you can notice, here is that the average build success, here is that the average build success, here is that the average build success, rate for this model was 68%., rate for this model was 68%., rate for this model was 68%., The linting was around 92%. Tests were, The linting was around 92%. Tests were, The linting was around 92%. Tests were, at the limit of 62% and the average, at the limit of 62% and the average, at the limit of 62% and the average, duration was I mean it was around 3.95, duration was I mean it was around 3.95, duration was I mean it was around 3.95, at least for my tests where I used open, at least for my tests where I used open, at least for my tests where I used open, router. But next is Evolve got a, router. But next is Evolve got a, router. But next is Evolve got a, different average duration going all the, different average duration going all the, different average duration going all the, way down to 7.73, way down to 7.73, way down to 7.73, seconds. And this is massive. Not, seconds. And this is massive. Not, seconds. And this is massive. Not, because the model is just suddenly, because the model is just suddenly, because the model is just suddenly, faster at just processing tokens faster, faster at just processing tokens faster, faster at just processing tokens faster, but it takes less tokens to figure out, but it takes less tokens to figure out, but it takes less tokens to figure out, the response for things. So, for, the response for things. So, for, the response for things. So, for, example, the Gemini 3.0 Pro preview, example, the Gemini 3.0 Pro preview, example, the Gemini 3.0 Pro preview, thinks a lot and wastes basically three, thinks a lot and wastes basically three, thinks a lot and wastes basically three, times the amount of tokens than Claude, times the amount of tokens than Claude, times the amount of tokens than Claude, Opus 4.5. And this reduces a lot the, Opus 4.5. And this reduces a lot the, Opus 4.5. And this reduces a lot the, costs as well as the average duration., costs as well as the average duration., costs as well as the average duration., By the way, we'll see more about that in, By the way, we'll see more about that in, By the way, we'll see more about that in, the enthropic article. So, let's mark, the enthropic article. So, let's mark, the enthropic article. So, let's mark, this off and head over to the, this off and head over to the, this off and head over to the, introducing COD Opus 4.5. What's really, introducing COD Opus 4.5. What's really, introducing COD Opus 4.5. What's really, funny in this article is that they have, funny in this article is that they have, funny in this article is that they have, a lot of reports over the Gemini 3 Pro, a lot of reports over the Gemini 3 Pro, a lot of reports over the Gemini 3 Pro, which is really recent, got a lot of, which is really recent, got a lot of, which is really recent, got a lot of, attention, and Claude Opus 4.5 being, attention, and Claude Opus 4.5 being, attention, and Claude Opus 4.5 being, able to launch this after them gives, able to launch this after them gives, able to launch this after them gives, them a huge edge on just really, them a huge edge on just really, them a huge edge on just really, comparing their model and showing, hey, comparing their model and showing, hey, comparing their model and showing, hey, our model is just better and these are, our model is just better and these are, our model is just better and these are, the reasons why. So, we already took a, the reasons why. So, we already took a, the reasons why. So, we already took a, look at the benchmarks, but all the way, look at the benchmarks, but all the way, look at the benchmarks, but all the way, down here, they have an evaluation for, down here, they have an evaluation for, down here, they have an evaluation for, concerning behavior. Basically, in our, concerning behavior. Basically, in our, concerning behavior. Basically, in our, evaluation, concerning behavior scores, evaluation, concerning behavior scores, evaluation, concerning behavior scores, measure a very wide range of misaligned, measure a very wide range of misaligned, measure a very wide range of misaligned, behavior, including both cooperation, behavior, including both cooperation, behavior, including both cooperation, with human misuse and undesirable, with human misuse and undesirable, with human misuse and undesirable, actions that the model takes at its own, actions that the model takes at its own, actions that the model takes at its own, initiative. So, what Cloud is basically, initiative. So, what Cloud is basically, initiative. So, what Cloud is basically, trying to say here is that their model, trying to say here is that their model, trying to say here is that their model, is safer. And then down here they, is safer. And then down here they, is safer. And then down here they, reinforce that with the susceptibility, reinforce that with the susceptibility, reinforce that with the susceptibility, to prompt injection style attacks where, to prompt injection style attacks where, to prompt injection style attacks where, compared with the other great models, compared with the other great models, compared with the other great models, Opus 4.5 thinking is just much much, Opus 4.5 thinking is just much much, Opus 4.5 thinking is just much much, safer. Now there's this video down here, safer. Now there's this video down here, safer. Now there's this video down here, that I really really really enjoyed and, that I really really really enjoyed and, that I really really really enjoyed and, I wish I'd built something similar so, I wish I'd built something similar so, I wish I'd built something similar so, that I could test all the models in this, that I could test all the models in this, that I could test all the models in this, same style. So Cloud Opus 4.5 solves a, same style. So Cloud Opus 4.5 solves a, same style. So Cloud Opus 4.5 solves a, puzzle game and then they compare with, puzzle game and then they compare with, puzzle game and then they compare with, Cloud 4.5 and basically shows how Opus, Cloud 4.5 and basically shows how Opus, Cloud 4.5 and basically shows how Opus, 4.5 is just smarter and wastes less, 4.5 is just smarter and wastes less, 4.5 is just smarter and wastes less, tokens to finish a given task and then, tokens to finish a given task and then, tokens to finish a given task and then, complete the entire game. Sonet 4.5, complete the entire game. Sonet 4.5, complete the entire game. Sonet 4.5, context window is almost out while OPUS, context window is almost out while OPUS, context window is almost out while OPUS, 4.5 is like nearly at 10%. So yeah, that, 4.5 is like nearly at 10%. So yeah, that, 4.5 is like nearly at 10%. So yeah, that, was completed much faster and cheaper, was completed much faster and cheaper, was completed much faster and cheaper, and without wasting so much of the, and without wasting so much of the, and without wasting so much of the, context window. So yeah, just just by it, context window. So yeah, just just by it, context window. So yeah, just just by it, being smarter, you gain so much from, being smarter, you gain so much from, being smarter, you gain so much from, that. It's it's crazy. But yeah, that's, that. It's it's crazy. But yeah, that's, that. It's it's crazy. But yeah, that's, really what I wanted to show from the, really what I wanted to show from the, really what I wanted to show from the, Anthropic article. Now, let's do a quick, Anthropic article. Now, let's do a quick, Anthropic article. Now, let's do a quick, comparison. And this quick comparison is, comparison. And this quick comparison is, comparison. And this quick comparison is, basically recreating this website using, basically recreating this website using, basically recreating this website using, the same exact prompt that I used for, the same exact prompt that I used for, the same exact prompt that I used for, Gemini 3 Pro, but now in the Opus 4.5., Gemini 3 Pro, but now in the Opus 4.5., Gemini 3 Pro, but now in the Opus 4.5., Oh, and by the way, that was created, Oh, and by the way, that was created, Oh, and by the way, that was created, inside of anti-gravity. Now, we'll, inside of anti-gravity. Now, we'll, inside of anti-gravity. Now, we'll, create the test inside of cursor or, create the test inside of cursor or, create the test inside of cursor or, claude. Let me see. I think we can build, claude. Let me see. I think we can build, claude. Let me see. I think we can build, it inside of Claude. So, skip, it inside of Claude. So, skip, it inside of Claude. So, skip, permissions. Let's hose this out a bit., permissions. Let's hose this out a bit., permissions. Let's hose this out a bit., So, yeah, instead of cursor, let's go, So, yeah, instead of cursor, let's go, So, yeah, instead of cursor, let's go, with claude. This will basically be a, with claude. This will basically be a, with claude. This will basically be a, test between agents as well. Let me, test between agents as well. Let me, test between agents as well. Let me, place the entire prompt in here. As you, place the entire prompt in here. As you, place the entire prompt in here. As you, can see, it's using the Opus 4.5 model., can see, it's using the Opus 4.5 model., can see, it's using the Opus 4.5 model., Um, yeah, let's hit enter and see what, Um, yeah, let's hit enter and see what, Um, yeah, let's hit enter and see what, it builds for us. Oh, and by the way, it, it builds for us. Oh, and by the way, it, it builds for us. Oh, and by the way, it, just started. Let's start a stopwatch to, just started. Let's start a stopwatch to, just started. Let's start a stopwatch to, track how long it takes to finish this, track how long it takes to finish this, track how long it takes to finish this, up. I just remembered that Claude has, up. I just remembered that Claude has, up. I just remembered that Claude has, its own stopwatch here, but I mean at, its own stopwatch here, but I mean at, its own stopwatch here, but I mean at, the end it doesn't show like the the, the end it doesn't show like the the, the end it doesn't show like the the, total time. So, I guess we're we're good, total time. So, I guess we're we're good, total time. So, I guess we're we're good, with our our own stopwatch. And while, with our our own stopwatch. And while, with our our own stopwatch. And while, this is running, let me share a thought, this is running, let me share a thought, this is running, let me share a thought, that I had about this model, which is, that I had about this model, which is, that I had about this model, which is, that I think that it might be that type, that I think that it might be that type, that I think that it might be that type, of model that you activate whenever you, of model that you activate whenever you, of model that you activate whenever you, need help in like debugging something, need help in like debugging something, need help in like debugging something, whenever you're stuck implementing, whenever you're stuck implementing, whenever you're stuck implementing, something that another LM really, something that another LM really, something that another LM really, couldn't handle, then you'd kind of, couldn't handle, then you'd kind of, couldn't handle, then you'd kind of, change over to Opus and use it to solve, change over to Opus and use it to solve, change over to Opus and use it to solve, that. And this is really just a thought, that. And this is really just a thought, that. And this is really just a thought, based on its pricing. I mean, it's much, based on its pricing. I mean, it's much, based on its pricing. I mean, it's much, cheaper than what it like the previous, cheaper than what it like the previous, cheaper than what it like the previous, Opus versions and also because everyone, Opus versions and also because everyone, Opus versions and also because everyone, is just saying how this model is, is just saying how this model is, is just saying how this model is, actually being efficient at solving bugs, actually being efficient at solving bugs, actually being efficient at solving bugs, that previous models just couldn't., that previous models just couldn't., that previous models just couldn't., Yeah, it's been nearly 9 minutes taking, Yeah, it's been nearly 9 minutes taking, Yeah, it's been nearly 9 minutes taking, much longer than I expected. Probably, much longer than I expected. Probably, much longer than I expected. Probably, because a lot of people is testing this, because a lot of people is testing this, because a lot of people is testing this, model. Uh but yeah, I generated almost, model. Uh but yeah, I generated almost, model. Uh but yeah, I generated almost, 25,000 tokens and I expect this to be, 25,000 tokens and I expect this to be, 25,000 tokens and I expect this to be, like the ultimate landing page/dashboard, like the ultimate landing page/dashboard, like the ultimate landing page/dashboard, and everything else that I inserted in, and everything else that I inserted in, and everything else that I inserted in, that prompt. npm rundev. Let's see if we, that prompt. npm rundev. Let's see if we, that prompt. npm rundev. Let's see if we, didn't get any mistake here. And by the, didn't get any mistake here. And by the, didn't get any mistake here. And by the, way, this took 20 minutes to build. Got, way, this took 20 minutes to build. Got, way, this took 20 minutes to build. Got, an error.

This is Cloud Opus 4.5. Man, I was, Pro. This is Cloud Opus 4.5. Man, I was, Pro. This is Cloud Opus 4.5. Man, I was, so sure that Gemini 3 Pro would have a, so sure that Gemini 3 Pro would have a, so sure that Gemini 3 Pro would have a, better styling, but this this is just, better styling, but this this is just, better styling, but this this is just, much better. Even this logo up here, much better. Even this logo up here, much better. Even this logo up here, like it actually picked up on a more, like it actually picked up on a more, like it actually picked up on a more, similar logo to the one from Firecrawl., similar logo to the one from Firecrawl., similar logo to the one from Firecrawl., So, Gemini Pro also generated a, So, Gemini Pro also generated a, So, Gemini Pro also generated a, dashboard page. This is what it looks, dashboard page. This is what it looks, dashboard page. This is what it looks, like, right? We get that toggle down. Uh, like, right? We get that toggle down. Uh, like, right? We get that toggle down. Uh, let's see what Cloud 4.5 Opus built for, let's see what Cloud 4.5 Opus built for, let's see what Cloud 4.5 Opus built for, us as a dashboard.

Cloud, 4.5 opus crushes arc AGI and scores, 4.5 opus crushes arc AGI and scores, 4.5 opus crushes arc AGI and scores, 37.6%., 37.6%., 37.6%., So this is another benchmark where Cloud, So this is another benchmark where Cloud, So this is another benchmark where Cloud, Opus 4.5 just crushed. Then we have this, Opus 4.5 just crushed. Then we have this, Opus 4.5 just crushed. Then we have this, game which someone apparently just, game which someone apparently just, game which someone apparently just, created and it seems like comparing with, created and it seems like comparing with, created and it seems like comparing with, Gemini 3 Pro as well, it didn't have, Gemini 3 Pro as well, it didn't have, Gemini 3 Pro as well, it didn't have, such a good result. Okay. Yeah, there's, such a good result. Okay. Yeah, there's, such a good result. Okay. Yeah, there's, this guy commenting about the benchmarks, this guy commenting about the benchmarks, this guy commenting about the benchmarks, as well. Then again about the pricing, as well.
