Another thing about Oppus 4.5, Opus 4.5. Another thing about Oppus 4.5, Opus 4.5. Another thing about Oppus 4.5, is that it is far way better than Oppus, is that it is far way better than Oppus, is that it is far way better than Oppus, 4.1 but significantly cheaper than Opus, 4.1 but significantly cheaper than Opus, 4.1 but significantly cheaper than Opus, 4.1. And the even cooler thing is that, 4.1. And the even cooler thing is that, 4.1. And the even cooler thing is that, if you're using cursor right now you can, if you're using cursor right now you can, if you're using cursor right now you can, access Cloud Oppus 4.5 in cursor at the, access Cloud Oppus 4.5 in cursor at the, access Cloud Oppus 4.5 in cursor at the, same cost as sonet 4.5. And yes, you, same cost as sonet 4.5. And yes, you, same cost as sonet 4.5. And yes, you, heard it correct. For the next two, heard it correct. For the next two, heard it correct. For the next two, weeks, I believe cursor is running a, weeks, I believe cursor is running a, weeks, I believe cursor is running a, promo or some kind of offer where the, promo or some kind of offer where the, promo or some kind of offer where the, price for Opus 4.5 is as same as the, price for Opus 4.5 is as same as the, price for Opus 4.5 is as same as the, Sonet 4.5, of course, with significantly, Sonet 4.5, of course, with significantly, Sonet 4.5, of course, with significantly, better performance. And as you can see, better performance. And as you can see, better performance. And as you can see, this right here is the official release, this right here is the official release, this right here is the official release, blog post on the Anthropic website. And, blog post on the Anthropic website. And, blog post on the Anthropic website. And, today in this video, we are going to, today in this video, we are going to, today in this video, we are going to, explore Cloud Opus 4.5 some of its, explore Cloud Opus 4.5 some of its, explore Cloud Opus 4.5 some of its, benchmark and also actually try to use, benchmark and also actually try to use, benchmark and also actually try to use, it within cursor and cloud desktop and, it within cursor and cloud desktop and, it within cursor and cloud desktop and, we'll see how good is Oppus 4.5. All, we'll see how good is Oppus 4.5. All, we'll see how good is Oppus 4.5. All, right. So as you can see here we have, right. So as you can see here we have, right.

All right. And, agents and computer use. All right. And, agents and computer use. All right. And, now right to the top of this blog post, now right to the top of this blog post, now right to the top of this blog post, we can find the SWE bench, that is the, we can find the SWE bench, that is the, we can find the SWE bench, that is the, software engineering benchmark. And as, software engineering benchmark. And as, software engineering benchmark. And as, you can see, OPUS 4.5 tops the chart at, you can see, OPUS 4.5 tops the chart at, you can see, OPUS 4.5 tops the chart at, 80.9% which is actually way better than, 80.9% which is actually way better than, 80.9% which is actually way better than, Gemini 3 Pro, which was launched last, Gemini 3 Pro, which was launched last, Gemini 3 Pro, which was launched last, week. And also GPT 5.1 Cordex Max, which, week. And also GPT 5.1 Cordex Max, which, week. And also GPT 5.1 Cordex Max, which, was also launched last week, I believe., was also launched last week, I believe., was also launched last week, I believe., And again, one thing that you'll have to, And again, one thing that you'll have to, And again, one thing that you'll have to, note here is that the range actually, note here is that the range actually, note here is that the range actually, starts from 70 to 82. So it's not, starts from 70 to 82. So it's not, starts from 70 to 82. So it's not, actually a lot. It might seem like, actually a lot. It might seem like, actually a lot. It might seem like, there's a lot of difference but if you, there's a lot of difference but if you, there's a lot of difference but if you, look at GPT 5.1 Cordex high it is 77.9, look at GPT 5.1 Cordex high it is 77.9, look at GPT 5.1 Cordex high it is 77.9, but it is just 80.9 but it's actually, but it is just 80.9 but it's actually, but it is just 80.9 but it's actually, way better when compared with OPU 4.1., way better when compared with OPU 4.1., way better when compared with OPU 4.1., Okay. And now if I scroll down as for, Okay. And now if I scroll down as for, Okay. And now if I scroll down as for, the pricing it says pricing is now at $5, the pricing it says pricing is now at $5, the pricing it says pricing is now at $5, for input and $25 per million output, for input and $25 per million output, for input and $25 per million output, tokens making OPUS level capabilities, tokens making OPUS level capabilities, tokens making OPUS level capabilities, access to even more users teams and, access to even more users teams and, access to even more users teams and, enterprises. So the idea here is that, enterprises. So the idea here is that, enterprises. So the idea here is that, Oppus is now becoming cheaper is what it, Oppus is now becoming cheaper is what it, Oppus is now becoming cheaper is what it, seems. Of course that's a good thing., seems. Of course that's a good thing., seems. Of course that's a good thing., And again if I further scroll down this, And again if I further scroll down this, And again if I further scroll down this, right here is an interesting read right, right here is an interesting read right, right here is an interesting read right, here. So evaluating cloud opus 4.5. And, here. So evaluating cloud opus 4.5. And, here. So evaluating cloud opus 4.5. And, as you can see it says we give, as you can see it says we give, as you can see it says we give, prospective performance engineering, prospective performance engineering, prospective performance engineering, candidates a notoriously difficult, candidates a notoriously difficult, candidates a notoriously difficult, take-home exam. And we also test the new, take-home exam. And we also test the new, take-home exam. And we also test the new, models on this exam as an internal, models on this exam as an internal, models on this exam as an internal, benchmark. And within our prescribed, benchmark. And within our prescribed, benchmark. And within our prescribed, 2-hour time limit clude OPUS 4.5 scored, 2-hour time limit clude OPUS 4.5 scored, 2-hour time limit clude OPUS 4.5 scored, higher than any human candidate ever. So, higher than any human candidate ever. So, higher than any human candidate ever. So, in a lot of these benchmark results as, in a lot of these benchmark results as, in a lot of these benchmark results as, you can see OPUS 4.5 tops the chart, you can see OPUS 4.5 tops the chart, you can see OPUS 4.5 tops the chart, specifically in agentic coding agentic, specifically in agentic coding agentic, specifically in agentic coding agentic, terminal coding agentic tool use then, terminal coding agentic tool use then, terminal coding agentic tool use then, computer use visual reasoning and all, computer use visual reasoning and all, computer use visual reasoning and all, that right and again if you want to read, that right and again if you want to read, that right and again if you want to read, more about all the changes and you know, more about all the changes and you know, more about all the changes and you know, if you are a nerd you can go through all, if you are a nerd you can go through all, if you are a nerd you can go through all, these benchmark results in here and, these benchmark results in here and, these benchmark results in here and, right now if you head over to cloudai, right now if you head over to cloudai, right now if you head over to cloudai, and if you sign into your account if you, and if you sign into your account if you, and if you sign into your account if you, click on this model drop-own menu of, click on this model drop-own menu of, click on this model drop-own menu of, course you can now find us 4.5 and again, course you can now find us 4.5 and again, course you can now find us 4.5 and again, if I open the cloud desktop app there, if I open the cloud desktop app there, if I open the cloud desktop app there, you go here we have us 4.5 5 and again, you go here we have us 4.5 5 and again, you go here we have us 4.5 5 and again, if I open let's say uh cursor there, if I open let's say uh cursor there, if I open let's say uh cursor there, again we have OPUS 4.5 live already and, again we have OPUS 4.5 live already and, again we have OPUS 4.5 live already and, when I open cursor see this as you can, when I open cursor see this as you can, when I open cursor see this as you can, see it says available at sonet 4.5, see it says available at sonet 4.5, see it says available at sonet 4.5, course during the first two weeks so, course during the first two weeks so, course during the first two weeks so, till December 5th you can just use oppus, till December 5th you can just use oppus, till December 5th you can just use oppus, 4.5 just like you would use sonet 4.5, 4.5 just like you would use sonet 4.5, 4.5 just like you would use sonet 4.5, and as you can see here I opened cursor, and as you can see here I opened cursor, and as you can see here I opened cursor, and I went ahead and gave a prompt, and I went ahead and gave a prompt, and I went ahead and gave a prompt, asking oppus 4.5 to create a, asking oppus 4.5 to create a, asking oppus 4.5 to create a, Minecraftstyled vauil game that is, Minecraftstyled vauil game that is, Minecraftstyled vauil game that is, playable in browser using 3JS is so this, playable in browser using 3JS is so this, playable in browser using 3JS is so this, right here is like a extensive prompt I, right here is like a extensive prompt I, right here is like a extensive prompt I, gave and in just one prompt what Oppus, gave and in just one prompt what Oppus, gave and in just one prompt what Oppus, 4.5 actually built is actually you know, 4.5 actually built is actually you know, 4.5 actually built is actually you know, surprising so maybe I can just go ahead, surprising so maybe I can just go ahead, surprising so maybe I can just go ahead, and open the index html file and there, and open the index html file and there, and open the index html file and there, you go this right here is the Minecraft, you go this right here is the Minecraft, you go this right here is the Minecraft, inspired game or let's say you could say, inspired game or let's say you could say, inspired game or let's say you could say, Minecraft kind of a browser game created, Minecraft kind of a browser game created, Minecraft kind of a browser game created, by Opus 4.5 in just a single prompt okay, by Opus 4.5 in just a single prompt okay, by Opus 4.5 in just a single prompt okay, I can move around and if I want to I can, I can move around and if I want to I can, I can move around and if I want to I can, remove blocks like this and if I want to, remove blocks like this and if I want to, remove blocks like this and if I want to, add any blocks.

But there you go. This right, of stuff. But there you go. This right, of stuff. But there you go. This right, here is the Minecraft game that the AI, here is the Minecraft game that the AI, here is the Minecraft game that the AI, was able to generate specifically OUS, was able to generate specifically OUS, was able to generate specifically OUS, 4.5. And then I went ahead and asked, 4.5. And then I went ahead and asked, 4.5. And then I went ahead and asked, Oppus to create a new 3D Lego style, Oppus to create a new 3D Lego style, Oppus to create a new 3D Lego style, brick builder. Okay. And that is also, brick builder. Okay. And that is also, brick builder. Okay. And that is also, done. And maybe I can open the, done. And maybe I can open the, done. And maybe I can open the, index.html file. And this right here is, index.html file. And this right here is, index.html file. And this right here is, what the AI built in just a single, what the AI built in just a single, what the AI built in just a single, prompt. I can zoom in, zoom out. And, prompt. I can zoom in, zoom out. And, prompt. I can zoom in, zoom out. And, there you go. And I can select the brick, there you go. And I can select the brick, there you go. And I can select the brick, size from here and drop it anywhere like, size from here and drop it anywhere like, size from here and drop it anywhere like, this. And then I can change the size. I, this. And then I can change the size. I, this. And then I can change the size. I, can change the color. All right. Okay., can change the color. All right. Okay., can change the color. All right. Okay., Wow. So this is also something that I, Wow. So this is also something that I, Wow. So this is also something that I, built in just a single prompt in cloud, built in just a single prompt in cloud, built in just a single prompt in cloud, opus 4.5 and it uses 3JS by the way, opus 4.5 and it uses 3JS by the way, opus 4.5 and it uses 3JS by the way, interesting right so it's actually good, interesting right so it's actually good, interesting right so it's actually good, so as you can see cloud opus 4.5 is able, so as you can see cloud opus 4.5 is able, so as you can see cloud opus 4.5 is able, to oneshot a lot of stuff like this like, to oneshot a lot of stuff like this like, to oneshot a lot of stuff like this like, complex plane and all that and you know, complex plane and all that and you know, complex plane and all that and you know, this 3D environment and all that is, this 3D environment and all that is, this 3D environment and all that is, actually working fully in just a single, actually working fully in just a single, actually working fully in just a single, prompt so that's actually good and next, prompt so that's actually good and next, prompt so that's actually good and next, step what I want to try is that I'll go, step what I want to try is that I'll go, step what I want to try is that I'll go, ahead and ask Opus 4.5 to create a new, ahead and ask Opus 4.5 to create a new, ahead and ask Opus 4.5 to create a new, landing page and let's see how good it, landing page and let's see how good it, landing page and let's see how good it, is. Right? So, Gemini 3 Pro was actually, is. Right? So, Gemini 3 Pro was actually, is. Right? So, Gemini 3 Pro was actually, really really really good when it comes, really really really good when it comes, really really really good when it comes, to front end side of things and the kind, to front end side of things and the kind, to front end side of things and the kind, of landing pages that it was able to, of landing pages that it was able to, of landing pages that it was able to, create is absolutely good. Right? I just, create is absolutely good. Right? I just, create is absolutely good. Right? I just, want to check if Oppus is any better, want to check if Oppus is any better, want to check if Oppus is any better, like Opus 4.5 is any better. And the, like Opus 4.5 is any better. And the, like Opus 4.5 is any better. And the, thing about using clawed model, thing about using clawed model, thing about using clawed model, specifically or just about any other, specifically or just about any other, specifically or just about any other, model other than Gemini 3 Pro is that, model other than Gemini 3 Pro is that, model other than Gemini 3 Pro is that, when you give a prompt and ask it to, when you give a prompt and ask it to, when you give a prompt and ask it to, create a landing page or some kind of, create a landing page or some kind of, create a landing page or some kind of, front-end UI element, it will go ahead, front-end UI element, it will go ahead, front-end UI element, it will go ahead, and use that purple color and obviously, and use that purple color and obviously, and use that purple color and obviously, it screens AI. So let's just say this, it screens AI. So let's just say this, it screens AI. So let's just say this, writer is a gaming platform and I want, writer is a gaming platform and I want, writer is a gaming platform and I want, it to create a landing page for the, it to create a landing page for the, it to create a landing page for the, same. So I can give a prompt in here. So, same. So I can give a prompt in here. So, same. So I can give a prompt in here. So, here I have given a prompt asking the AI, here I have given a prompt asking the AI, here I have given a prompt asking the AI, to create a sleek and modern looking, to create a sleek and modern looking, to create a sleek and modern looking, landing page for a gaming platform which, landing page for a gaming platform which, landing page for a gaming platform which, is this one right here. And now I'll go, is this one right here. And now I'll go, is this one right here. And now I'll go, ahead and hit enter and let's wait for, ahead and hit enter and let's wait for, ahead and hit enter and let's wait for, it. Hopefully I don't see any purple, it. Hopefully I don't see any purple, it. Hopefully I don't see any purple, color kind of or let's say how good, color kind of or let's say how good, color kind of or let's say how good, Oppus 4.5 is. All right. So the AI has, Oppus 4.5 is. All right. So the AI has, Oppus 4.5 is. All right. So the AI has, managed to create the landing page and, managed to create the landing page and, managed to create the landing page and, it actually created a new folder called, it actually created a new folder called, it actually created a new folder called, as gaming platform. And again here we, as gaming platform. And again here we, as gaming platform. And again here we, have index main and style files. Okay., have index main and style files. Okay., have index main and style files. Okay., So if you want to review okay everything, So if you want to review okay everything, So if you want to review okay everything, looks good and next step I'll try to, looks good and next step I'll try to, looks good and next step I'll try to, open the index.html file to see the, open the index.html file to see the, open the index.html file to see the, output and let's see how it is. Okay., output and let's see how it is. Okay., output and let's see how it is. Okay., Maybe I can open it up., Maybe I can open it up., Maybe I can open it up., All right. So, this right here is the, All right. So, this right here is the, All right. So, this right here is the, landing page that the Air has created, landing page that the Air has created, landing page that the Air has created, for a gaming platform. And to be honest, for a gaming platform. And to be honest, for a gaming platform. And to be honest, I kind of have like a mixed feeling, I kind of have like a mixed feeling, I kind of have like a mixed feeling, about it. All the phones and all that is, about it. All the phones and all that is, about it. All the phones and all that is, actually really apt for a gaming, actually really apt for a gaming, actually really apt for a gaming, platform. All these animations and stuff, platform. All these animations and stuff, platform. All these animations and stuff, look good. All these cards look good., look good. All these cards look good., look good. All these cards look good., And we have that nice, you know, subtle, And we have that nice, you know, subtle, And we have that nice, you know, subtle, grid towards the background. And also, grid towards the background. And also, grid towards the background. And also, that gradient colors as well. The phone, that gradient colors as well. The phone, that gradient colors as well. The phone, looks nice, too. Okay, it's reasonably, looks nice, too. Okay, it's reasonably, looks nice, too. Okay, it's reasonably, good is what I would say. And is cloud, good is what I would say. And is cloud, good is what I would say. And is cloud, finally getting good at front end? I, finally getting good at front end? I, finally getting good at front end? I, don't know. And next up, one more update, don't know. And next up, one more update, don't know. And next up, one more update, before we wind up the video is that, before we wind up the video is that, before we wind up the video is that, apart from cloud opus 4.5? Now you can, apart from cloud opus 4.5? Now you can, apart from cloud opus 4.5? Now you can, directly use cloud code on the cloud app, directly use cloud code on the cloud app, directly use cloud code on the cloud app, on the desktop. If you open the cloud, on the desktop. If you open the cloud, on the desktop. If you open the cloud, app right now towards the top, you now, app right now towards the top, you now, app right now towards the top, you now, have a toggle to toggle to the cloud, have a toggle to toggle to the cloud, have a toggle to toggle to the cloud, code. That is the web kind of version., code. That is the web kind of version., code. That is the web kind of version., And then again, you can actually spin up, And then again, you can actually spin up, And then again, you can actually spin up, a new agent, a local one or let's say a, a new agent, a local one or let's say a, a new agent, a local one or let's say a, cloud one. And you can start using cloud, cloud one. And you can start using cloud, cloud one. And you can start using cloud, code directly in the cloud desktop app., code directly in the cloud desktop app., code directly in the cloud desktop app., And that is also one more new change, And that is also one more new change, And that is also one more new change, along with Opus 4.5. So being able to, along with Opus 4.5. So being able to, along with Opus 4.5. So being able to, directly use the CL code directly within, directly use the CL code directly within, directly use the CL code directly within, the cloud desktop app. I'll take that., the cloud desktop app. I'll take that., the cloud desktop app. I'll take that., And again definitely make sure to check, And again definitely make sure to check, And again definitely make sure to check, out cursor and you can now use cloud, out cursor and you can now use cloud, out cursor and you can now use cloud, opus 4.5 for the same price as that of, opus 4.5 for the same price as that of, opus 4.5 for the same price as that of, sonet 4.5. And trust me you definitely, sonet 4.5. And trust me you definitely, sonet 4.5. And trust me you definitely, don't want to miss it. And I've been, don't want to miss it. And I've been, don't want to miss it. And I've been, playing around with Oppus 4.5 for a, playing around with Oppus 4.5 for a, playing around with Oppus 4.5 for a, couple of hours right now and it is, couple of hours right now and it is, couple of hours right now and it is, actually really good is what I would, actually really good is what I would, actually really good is what I would, say. And I've been comparing the outputs, say. And I've been comparing the outputs, say. And I've been comparing the outputs, of Sonet 4.5 and Opus 4.5 and there are, of Sonet 4.5 and Opus 4.5 and there are, of Sonet 4.5 and Opus 4.5 and there are, some drastic differences and you know, some drastic differences and you know, some drastic differences and you know, changes and you'll definitely feel it, changes and you'll definitely feel it, changes and you'll definitely feel it, when you start using the same. And again, when you start using the same. And again, when you start using the same. And again, if you want to learn more and take a, if you want to learn more and take a, if you want to learn more and take a, look at all these benchmark results I'll, look at all these benchmark results I'll, look at all these benchmark results I'll, make sure to leave link to this blog, make sure to leave link to this blog, make sure to leave link to this blog, post in the description below.
