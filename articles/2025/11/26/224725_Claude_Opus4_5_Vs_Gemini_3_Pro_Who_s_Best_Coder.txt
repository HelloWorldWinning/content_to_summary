好的，这是根据您提供的文本内容，为您精心提炼和组织的摘要信息。

### **核心观点摘要**

#### **一、 介绍与背景**
*   **对比模型**：Anthropic Claude **Opus 4.5** 与 Google **Gemini 3 Pro** Preview。
*   **核心变化**：Opus 4.5 价格大幅下调，输入和输出Token成本约为前代（Opus 4.1）的三分之一，降价约67%，使其在长上下文场景下与Gemini 3 Pro的价格更具可比性。

#### **二、 多维度任务对比评测**
1.  **SVG矢量图生成**
    *   **PS5控制器**：Gemini 3 Pro 胜出，形状和布局更准确。
    *   **iPhone 16 Pro**：Gemini 3 Pro 胜出，摄像头和动态岛的细节还原更好。
    *   **Cybertruck**：平局/均失败，两者生成的图像都比较糟糕。
    *   **Air Jordan运动鞋**：Gemini 3 Pro 胜出，生成的图像更具辨识度。
    *   **结论**：Gemini 3 Pro 在SVG生成任务上表现明显更优。

2.  **前端开发 (HTML/CSS/JS)**
    *   **3D体素沙盒游戏 (类Minecraft)**：Opus 4.5 胜出，修复后的版本功能更完善，没有Gemini的视觉穿透Bug。
    *   **金融交易分析平台 (类TradingView)**：Opus 4.5 压倒性胜出，生成了近4000行代码，功能极其丰富，包括多种指标、绘图工具和可交互性。
    *   **游戏玩家作品集网站**：Opus 4.5 胜出，设计更完整，交互元素和动态效果更佳。
    *   **奢侈品植物店网站**：Gemini 3 Pro 胜出，虽然两者都表现出色，但Gemini的网站功能（如购物车）更完整，没有出现文本颜色等UI Bug。
    *   **飞行模拟器游戏**：Gemini 3 Pro 胜出，生成了具有程序化生成环境的、视觉效果更好的3D场景。
    *   **爬坡赛车游戏 (Hill Climb Racing)**：平局/均失败，两个模型经过两轮迭代都未能生成可玩的版本。
    *   **结论**：Opus 4.5 在需要代码量大、功能复杂的专业级前端应用上表现卓越；而Gemini在创意和游戏类前端任务上表现出色。

3.  **后端开发 (Python)**
    *   **水果忍者游戏 (Pygame)**：Gemini 3 Pro 胜出，游戏机制正常，而Opus 4.5的版本存在点击Bug。
    *   **macOS Sequoia 桌面模拟 (PyQT5)**：Opus 4.5 胜出，生成了超过5600行代码，实现了包括终端、计算器、时钟在内的多个可交互应用，功能远比Gemini的版本丰富。
    *   **音乐可视化工具**：Gemini 3 Pro 胜出，生成的视觉效果更佳，且在迭代优化后表现更好。
    *   **结论**：Gemini 3 Pro 在游戏和可视化等任务上表现高效，而Opus 4.5 在构建复杂、多功能的桌面级应用上能力更强。

#### **三、 模型行为与特性分析**
*   **Gemini 3 Pro**：
    *   **行为模式**：倾向于“懒惰”和高效，总是试图用更少的代码完成任务。
    *   **优点**：在SVG生成和部分后端任务中，这种高效性使其表现出色。
    *   **缺点**：在需要复杂和详尽功能的任务中，代码量的限制会影响最终成品的完整性和质量。
*   **Opus 4.5**：
    *   **行为模式**：不吝于生成长代码，严格遵循“尽力做到最好”的指令，代码量通常是Gemini的数倍。
    *   **优点**：在构建复杂的前端和桌面应用时，能交付功能极度丰富和完善的成果。
    *   **缺点**：生成的代码量巨大，调试和维护成本可能更高。

On the other hand, Opus 4.5 is, tokens. On the other hand, Opus 4.5 is, tokens. On the other hand, Opus 4.5 is, just $5 per million input tokens and $25, just $5 per million input tokens and $25, just $5 per million input tokens and $25, per million output tokens. So, it is, per million output tokens. So, it is, per million output tokens. So, it is, one-third the previous pricing around, one-third the previous pricing around, one-third the previous pricing around, 67% price decrease. If you compare this, 67% price decrease. If you compare this, 67% price decrease. If you compare this, to Gemini 3 Pro preview, it is $2 per, to Gemini 3 Pro preview, it is $2 per, to Gemini 3 Pro preview, it is $2 per, million input tokens and $21 per million, million input tokens and $21 per million, million input tokens and $21 per million, output tokens. One thing that you have, output tokens. One thing that you have, output tokens. One thing that you have, to note is this is for less than 200k, to note is this is for less than 200k, to note is this is for less than 200k, context. If you go more than 200k, context.

But uh I, and night. That is awesome. But uh I, mean the see-through bug that we have, I, mean the see-through bug that we have, I, mean the see-through bug that we have, I, don't like it. Anyways, this is what we, don't like it. Anyways, this is what we, don't like it. Anyways, this is what we, have got from Gemini 3 Pro. Okay, have got from Gemini 3 Pro. Okay, have got from Gemini 3 Pro. Okay, everyone. So, we have a response from, everyone. So, we have a response from, everyone. So, we have a response from, Opus and it has generated 3,531, Opus and it has generated 3,531, Opus and it has generated 3,531, lines of code. So, I'm using a lot of, lines of code. So, I'm using a lot of, lines of code. So, I'm using a lot of, tokens. If you really are enjoying this, tokens. If you really are enjoying this, tokens. If you really are enjoying this, video, please do hit the like button., video, please do hit the like button., video, please do hit the like button., So, we'll preview this in a new page. I, So, we'll preview this in a new page. I, So, we'll preview this in a new page. I, don't know if this very long code is, don't know if this very long code is, don't know if this very long code is, going to work or not. So, we'll hit play, going to work or not. So, we'll hit play, going to work or not. So, we'll hit play, game. And it's generating the world. And, game. And it's generating the world. And, game. And it's generating the world. And, this is what we have now. You can see, this is what we have now. You can see, this is what we have now. You can see, the trees are actually better. We have, the trees are actually better. We have, the trees are actually better. We have, some flat ground. And I think again we, some flat ground. And I think again we, some flat ground. And I think again we, are able to see through the blocks which, are able to see through the blocks which, are able to see through the blocks which, shouldn't have happened. Let's try to, shouldn't have happened. Let's try to, shouldn't have happened. Let's try to, build something. I'm building using the, build something. I'm building using the, build something. I'm building using the, stones. So now you can see it is, stones. So now you can see it is, stones. So now you can see it is, somewhere around 6:00 in the morning and, somewhere around 6:00 in the morning and, somewhere around 6:00 in the morning and, you can see slowly it is turning into, you can see slowly it is turning into, you can see slowly it is turning into, morning. Let's try to break this tree., morning. Let's try to break this tree., morning. Let's try to break this tree., So you can see I'm able to break it. So, So you can see I'm able to break it.

So, you can see I've been trying to build, you can see I've been trying to build, you can see I've been trying to build, something and I think you can see this, something and I think you can see this, something and I think you can see this, is a stone wall and this is the glass, is a stone wall and this is the glass, is a stone wall and this is the glass, and this is supposed to be the door. So, and this is supposed to be the door. So, and this is supposed to be the door. So, I'm not so aware of this game. So it is, I'm not so aware of this game. So it is, I'm not so aware of this game. So it is, kind of difficult for me to generate, kind of difficult for me to generate, kind of difficult for me to generate, stuff but it does look good. You can see, stuff but it does look good. You can see, stuff but it does look good. You can see, the trees and sand and stuff like that., the trees and sand and stuff like that., the trees and sand and stuff like that., Let's enter fly mode and let's see new, Let's enter fly mode and let's see new, Let's enter fly mode and let's see new, environments are procedurally generated., environments are procedurally generated., environments are procedurally generated., So you can see new environment is, So you can see new environment is, So you can see new environment is, getting generated as we move. There is, getting generated as we move. There is, getting generated as we move. There is, no water though. I think it is all sand., no water though. I think it is all sand., no water though. I think it is all sand., All in all a good response., All in all a good response., All in all a good response., Comparatively Opus 4.5 was able to, Comparatively Opus 4.5 was able to, Comparatively Opus 4.5 was able to, improve its generation. So this is, improve its generation. So this is, improve its generation. So this is, indeed a win for Opus 4.5. Next up we, indeed a win for Opus 4.5. Next up we, indeed a win for Opus 4.5. Next up we, are asking to develop a highfidelity, are asking to develop a highfidelity, are asking to develop a highfidelity, clone of root ninja in Python using, clone of root ninja in Python using, clone of root ninja in Python using, Pygame. Let's see if they are able to do, Pygame. Let's see if they are able to do, Pygame. Let's see if they are able to do, this Python based coding. Let's send, this Python based coding.

And we, have a bomb. Okay, I have to be aware of, have a bomb. Okay, I have to be aware of, have a bomb. Okay, I have to be aware of, it. You can see when I slice the fruits, it. You can see when I slice the fruits, it. You can see when I slice the fruits, we have a sound., we have a sound., we have a sound., Let me see how far I can go. So I think, Let me see how far I can go. So I think, Let me see how far I can go. So I think, this is a slow power up wedge which, this is a slow power up wedge which, this is a slow power up wedge which, actually slows down the fruit., actually slows down the fruit., actually slows down the fruit., Okay, it is a game over. Okay, so it is, Okay, it is a game over. Okay, so it is, Okay, it is a game over. Okay, so it is, a game over. So I don't see anything, a game over. So I don't see anything, a game over. So I don't see anything, wrong in it., You can see I have to actually, You can see I have to actually, individually slice the fruits. If I bomb, individually slice the fruits. If I bomb, individually slice the fruits. If I bomb, we get one cross., we get one cross., we get one cross., You can see the slow power is enabled, You can see the slow power is enabled, You can see the slow power is enabled, now., Nice. It is a working response. Let's, Nice. It is a working response. Let's, move on to Opus 4.5. We'll paste the, move on to Opus 4.5. We'll paste the, move on to Opus 4.5. We'll paste the, code.

We have high scores, how to, awesome. We have high scores, how to, play settings, and stuff where we can, play settings, and stuff where we can, play settings, and stuff where we can, change the volume. Let's hit play. And, change the volume. Let's hit play. And, change the volume. Let's hit play. And, we have two fruits. Okay, there seems to, we have two fruits. Okay, there seems to, we have two fruits. Okay, there seems to, be a black box around them., be a black box around them., be a black box around them., That is not nice., Also, guys, I've actually found a bug., Also, guys, I've actually found a bug., So you can see you can click anywhere, So you can see you can click anywhere, So you can see you can click anywhere, and the fruits will be sliced., See I'm not even clicking on the fruits., See I'm not even clicking on the fruits., I'm just randomly clicking on the screen, I'm just randomly clicking on the screen, I'm just randomly clicking on the screen, and every fruit is getting sliced., So this is a bug. We also have a slow, So this is a bug. We also have a slow, power up as you can see., No wonder I'm able to get high score on, No wonder I'm able to get high score on, this version of root ninja generated by, this version of root ninja generated by, this version of root ninja generated by, 4.5. I do like you know the screen kind, 4.5. I do like you know the screen kind, 4.5. I do like you know the screen kind, of shakes when it's game over but yeah, of shakes when it's game over but yeah, of shakes when it's game over but yeah, it is kind of a broken game whereas, it is kind of a broken game whereas, it is kind of a broken game whereas, Gemini gave us a completely working, Gemini gave us a completely working, Gemini gave us a completely working, response. This win goes to Gemini 3 Pro., response. This win goes to Gemini 3 Pro., response. This win goes to Gemini 3 Pro., Let's move on to the next one. Now we, Let's move on to the next one. Now we, Let's move on to the next one. Now we, are back to SVGbased generation. This, are back to SVGbased generation. This, are back to SVGbased generation. This, time around we are asking them to create, time around we are asking them to create, time around we are asking them to create, a vector illustration of iPhone 16 Pro, a vector illustration of iPhone 16 Pro, a vector illustration of iPhone 16 Pro, Max with the natural titanium finish., Max with the natural titanium finish., Max with the natural titanium finish., Let's see if they are able to do it., Let's see if they are able to do it., Let's see if they are able to do it., Okay, we have the responses. Let's start, Okay, we have the responses. Let's start, Okay, we have the responses. Let's start, off with Gemini 3 Pro. So okay, when I, off with Gemini 3 Pro. So okay, when I, off with Gemini 3 Pro. So okay, when I, do full screen actually it kind of, do full screen actually it kind of, do full screen actually it kind of, breaks. So maybe I should keep it in, breaks. So maybe I should keep it in, breaks. So maybe I should keep it in, small screen. So you can see we have the, small screen. So you can see we have the, small screen. So you can see we have the, three iconic cameras, flashlight, other, three iconic cameras, flashlight, other, three iconic cameras, flashlight, other, sensors. The Apple logo is very close to, sensors. The Apple logo is very close to, sensors. The Apple logo is very close to, the original one but not fully nice. So, the original one but not fully nice. So, the original one but not fully nice. So, it says 941. We have the island dynamic, it says 941. We have the island dynamic, it says 941. We have the island dynamic, island and other buttons over here., island and other buttons over here., island and other buttons over here., Things are kind of messed up. All in, Things are kind of messed up. All in, Things are kind of messed up. All in, all, it looks good. Let's look at Opus, all, it looks good. Let's look at Opus, all, it looks good. Let's look at Opus, 4.5. So Oppus 4.5 also has given us a, 4.5. So Oppus 4.5 also has given us a, 4.5. So Oppus 4.5 also has given us a, similar kind of response. The issue is, similar kind of response. The issue is, similar kind of response. The issue is, the placement of the cameras is not very, the placement of the cameras is not very, the placement of the cameras is not very, right and also other sensor are also, right and also other sensor are also, right and also other sensor are also, messed up. The front view also looks, messed up. The front view also looks, messed up. The front view also looks, better in Gemini 3 Pro. Here we just see, better in Gemini 3 Pro. Here we just see, better in Gemini 3 Pro. Here we just see, some dynamic wallpaper. The dynamic, some dynamic wallpaper. The dynamic, some dynamic wallpaper. The dynamic, island as well doesn't look close to the, island as well doesn't look close to the, island as well doesn't look close to the, original one. So between Gemini 3 Pro, original one. So between Gemini 3 Pro, original one. So between Gemini 3 Pro, and Opus 4.5, I'll say it's a win for, and Opus 4.5, I'll say it's a win for, and Opus 4.5, I'll say it's a win for, Gemini 3 Pro. Let's move on to the next, Gemini 3 Pro. Let's move on to the next, Gemini 3 Pro. Let's move on to the next, one. Now let's ask them to create an, one. Now let's ask them to create an, one. Now let's ask them to create an, advanced professionalgrade financial, advanced professionalgrade financial, advanced professionalgrade financial, trading analysis platform very close to, trading analysis platform very close to, trading analysis platform very close to, Trading View. Let's send this to both of, Trading View. Let's send this to both of, Trading View. Let's send this to both of, them and you can pause and have a look, them and you can pause and have a look, them and you can pause and have a look, at the prompt. Okay, we have the, at the prompt. Okay, we have the, at the prompt. Okay, we have the, responses. Let's start off with Gemini 3, responses. Let's start off with Gemini 3, responses. Let's start off with Gemini 3, Pro preview. So we'll preview this in a, Pro preview. So we'll preview this in a, Pro preview. So we'll preview this in a, new page and this is what we have right, new page and this is what we have right, new page and this is what we have right, off the back. The chart looks good. You, off the back. The chart looks good. You, off the back. The chart looks good. You, can see the candles are updating tick by, can see the candles are updating tick by, can see the candles are updating tick by, tick. Well, what I don't see is you know, tick. Well, what I don't see is you know, tick. Well, what I don't see is you know, the candles actually filling. The, the candles actually filling. The, the candles actually filling. The, candles are just directly getting, candles are just directly getting, candles are just directly getting, generated instead of you know they, generated instead of you know they, generated instead of you know they, filling. Let me see if I'm able to show, filling. Let me see if I'm able to show, filling. Let me see if I'm able to show, you. Okay, actually it was getting, you. Okay, actually it was getting, you. Okay, actually it was getting, hidden. Now you can see we are able to, hidden. Now you can see we are able to, hidden. Now you can see we are able to, appreciate it. The candles are indeed, appreciate it. The candles are indeed, appreciate it. The candles are indeed, getting filled but I'm not sure if it's, getting filled but I'm not sure if it's, getting filled but I'm not sure if it's, a 1 minute candle. In the time frame it, a 1 minute candle. In the time frame it, a 1 minute candle. In the time frame it, does say that it's 1 minute but uh the, does say that it's 1 minute but uh the, does say that it's 1 minute but uh the, candles are getting filled up way, candles are getting filled up way, candles are getting filled up way, faster. Other than that, I think we have, faster. Other than that, I think we have, faster. Other than that, I think we have, RSI over here. I don't see any other, RSI over here. I don't see any other, RSI over here. I don't see any other, indicators. We have the draw option over, indicators. We have the draw option over, indicators. We have the draw option over, here. Let's see if we are able to draw, here. Let's see if we are able to draw, here. Let's see if we are able to draw, anything. We'll draw this trend line., anything. We'll draw this trend line., anything. We'll draw this trend line., So, you can see the trend line has been, So, you can see the trend line has been, So, you can see the trend line has been, drawn. Let's see if we are able to draw, drawn. Let's see if we are able to draw, drawn. Let's see if we are able to draw, anything else. It says toggle fib. So, I, anything else. It says toggle fib. So, I, anything else. It says toggle fib. So, I, think it is supposed to be Fibonacci., think it is supposed to be Fibonacci., think it is supposed to be Fibonacci., Let's draw this. And you can see the, Let's draw this. And you can see the, Let's draw this. And you can see the, Fibonacci has been drawn. We can also, Fibonacci has been drawn. We can also, Fibonacci has been drawn. We can also, clear it. We have a smooth moving, clear it. We have a smooth moving, clear it. We have a smooth moving, average. That is nice. Let me see if I'm, average. That is nice. Let me see if I'm, average. That is nice. Let me see if I'm, actually able to change the time frame., actually able to change the time frame., actually able to change the time frame., So no, I'm not able to change the time, So no, I'm not able to change the time, So no, I'm not able to change the time, frames for some weird reason. Let's keep, frames for some weird reason. Let's keep, frames for some weird reason. Let's keep, this aside and let's try OPUS. So let me, this aside and let's try OPUS. So let me, this aside and let's try OPUS. So let me, tell you, OPUS has generated 3,893, tell you, OPUS has generated 3,893, tell you, OPUS has generated 3,893, lines of code, nearly 4,000. So is it, lines of code, nearly 4,000. So is it, lines of code, nearly 4,000. So is it, worth it? Let's see. So this is what we, worth it? Let's see. So this is what we, worth it? Let's see. So this is what we, have. We have different time frames. You, have. We have different time frames. You, have. We have different time frames. You, can see we we are able to change between, can see we we are able to change between, can see we we are able to change between, these time frames. We also have a, these time frames. We also have a, these time frames. We also have a, notification on what has happened. I do, notification on what has happened. I do, notification on what has happened. I do, think that it's an accelerated kind of, think that it's an accelerated kind of, think that it's an accelerated kind of, because the candles don't take 1 minute, because the candles don't take 1 minute, because the candles don't take 1 minute, to get generated. We have a settings, to get generated. We have a settings, to get generated. We have a settings, panel. We do see a lot of tools and, panel. We do see a lot of tools and, panel. We do see a lot of tools and, stuff. We can change the color of the, stuff. We can change the color of the, stuff. We can change the color of the, candles as well. So I'll change the, candles as well. So I'll change the, candles as well. So I'll change the, bullish candle to green and bearish, bullish candle to green and bearish, bullish candle to green and bearish, candle to pink. So now you can see the, candle to pink. So now you can see the, candle to pink. So now you can see the, candle is a blue and pink variant., candle is a blue and pink variant., candle is a blue and pink variant., Awesome. I do like it. Let's change it, Awesome. I do like it. Let's change it, Awesome. I do like it. Let's change it, back to green and red. We can buy. So, back to green and red. We can buy. So, back to green and red. We can buy. So, you can see if I hit buy, it says buy, you can see if I hit buy, it says buy, you can see if I hit buy, it says buy, order executed and stuff like that. We, order executed and stuff like that. We, order executed and stuff like that. We, are able to change the time frames. But, are able to change the time frames. But, are able to change the time frames. But, uh the time taken for a candle to get, uh the time taken for a candle to get, uh the time taken for a candle to get, filled seems to be same. We have a lot, filled seems to be same. We have a lot, filled seems to be same. We have a lot, of tools. I guess you can see we have, of tools. I guess you can see we have, of tools. I guess you can see we have, crosshair. We have trend line. Let's, crosshair. We have trend line. Let's, crosshair. We have trend line. Let's, draw a trend line. Okay, trend line has, draw a trend line. Okay, trend line has, draw a trend line. Okay, trend line has, been drawn. We can hit reset. We have a, been drawn. We can hit reset. We have a, been drawn. We can hit reset. We have a, option to measure. We have option to add, option to measure. We have option to add, option to measure. We have option to add, text. But I think that is not working., text. But I think that is not working., text. But I think that is not working., We can add vertical lines. As you can, We can add vertical lines. As you can, We can add vertical lines. As you can, see, I'm able to add them. We can also, see, I'm able to add them. We can also, see, I'm able to add them. We can also, undo it. So that is nice. We have, undo it. So that is nice. We have, undo it. So that is nice. We have, Fibonacci. Let's see if that works. And, Fibonacci. Let's see if that works. And, Fibonacci. Let's see if that works. And, it does work. We are able to draw the, it does work. We are able to draw the, it does work. We are able to draw the, Fibonacci. And it actually looks even, Fibonacci. And it actually looks even, Fibonacci. And it actually looks even, better than what Gemini generated. So, better than what Gemini generated. So, better than what Gemini generated. So, let's undo this. We can draw horizontal, let's undo this. We can draw horizontal, let's undo this. We can draw horizontal, lines. So these are the two horizontal, lines. So these are the two horizontal, lines. So these are the two horizontal, lines that I will like to draw. Let's, lines that I will like to draw. Let's, lines that I will like to draw. Let's, undo this as well. You can see we are, undo this as well. You can see we are, undo this as well. You can see we are, able to go back and forth using this pan, able to go back and forth using this pan, able to go back and forth using this pan, mode. Now let's get over to indicators., mode. Now let's get over to indicators., mode. Now let's get over to indicators., We have a lot of indicators over here., We have a lot of indicators over here., We have a lot of indicators over here., Let's add smooth moving average and, Let's add smooth moving average and, Let's add smooth moving average and, smooth moving average gets added. Let's, smooth moving average gets added. Let's, smooth moving average gets added. Let's, add exponential moving average. And you, add exponential moving average. And you, add exponential moving average. And you, can see at the top over here all the, can see at the top over here all the, can see at the top over here all the, indicators that have been added are, indicators that have been added are, indicators that have been added are, visible over here. That is nice. We can, visible over here. That is nice. We can, visible over here. That is nice. We can, add RSI. Let's get rid of some of the, add RSI. Let's get rid of some of the, add RSI. Let's get rid of some of the, indicators. We have MACD, moving, indicators. We have MACD, moving, indicators. We have MACD, moving, average, convergence, divergence. And, average, convergence, divergence. And, average, convergence, divergence. And, this is the first model I guess which, this is the first model I guess which, this is the first model I guess which, has been able to generate this. Let's, has been able to generate this. Let's, has been able to generate this. Let's, see if we are able to change the stocks., see if we are able to change the stocks., see if we are able to change the stocks., And you can see we are actually able to, And you can see we are actually able to, And you can see we are actually able to, change the stocks. We also have a option, change the stocks. We also have a option, change the stocks. We also have a option, to get into full screen. We can draw a, to get into full screen. We can draw a, to get into full screen. We can draw a, rectangle as well. So let's draw a, rectangle as well. So let's draw a, rectangle as well. So let's draw a, rectangle over here. Okay, this is the, rectangle over here. Okay, this is the, rectangle over here. Okay, this is the, rectangle that has been drawn. So all in, rectangle that has been drawn. So all in, rectangle that has been drawn. So all in, all, it is a significantly better, all, it is a significantly better, all, it is a significantly better, response that what Gemini has given. You, response that what Gemini has given. You, response that what Gemini has given. You, can see both are able to get the, can see both are able to get the, can see both are able to get the, candlestick pattern right. Opus response, candlestick pattern right. Opus response, candlestick pattern right. Opus response, has more tools and more indicators and, has more tools and more indicators and, has more tools and more indicators and, more working stuff. In the prompt, if, more working stuff. In the prompt, if, more working stuff. In the prompt, if, you have paused and looked at it, we, you have paused and looked at it, we, you have paused and looked at it, we, have clearly mentioned that do your best, have clearly mentioned that do your best, have clearly mentioned that do your best, and take it to the full limit which Opus, and take it to the full limit which Opus, and take it to the full limit which Opus, 4.5 seems to be following. Gemini tries, 4.5 seems to be following. Gemini tries, 4.5 seems to be following. Gemini tries, to be efficient, which is a general, to be efficient, which is a general, to be efficient, which is a general, behavior of this model. We'll be talking, behavior of this model. We'll be talking, behavior of this model. We'll be talking, about their behavior and stuff in the, about their behavior and stuff in the, about their behavior and stuff in the, conclusion, but for this test, it is a, conclusion, but for this test, it is a, conclusion, but for this test, it is a, win for Opus 4.5. Next up, we are doing, win for Opus 4.5. Next up, we are doing, win for Opus 4.5. Next up, we are doing, some OS simulation in Python. So the, some OS simulation in Python. So the, some OS simulation in Python. So the, prompt is recreate the modern Mac OS, prompt is recreate the modern Mac OS, prompt is recreate the modern Mac OS, sequia desktop experience in a single, sequia desktop experience in a single, sequia desktop experience in a single, Python script using PIQT5. So let's send, Python script using PIQT5. So let's send, Python script using PIQT5. So let's send, this to both. The actual catch is doing, this to both. The actual catch is doing, this to both. The actual catch is doing, these OS simulations and stuff in HTML, these OS simulations and stuff in HTML, these OS simulations and stuff in HTML, CSS and JS and you know front end is, CSS and JS and you know front end is, CSS and JS and you know front end is, actually easy whereas doing this in, actually easy whereas doing this in, actually easy whereas doing this in, Python using PIQT5 is going to be hard., Python using PIQT5 is going to be hard., Python using PIQT5 is going to be hard., You know you don't get that fidelity, You know you don't get that fidelity, You know you don't get that fidelity, which you get in HTML, CSS and JS. Okay, which you get in HTML, CSS and JS. Okay, which you get in HTML, CSS and JS. Okay, we have the responses. Let's look at, we have the responses. Let's look at, we have the responses. Let's look at, Gemini 3 Pro now. So we'll copy the, Gemini 3 Pro now. So we'll copy the, Gemini 3 Pro now. So we'll copy the, code. We'll paste it and there is no, code.

And this is what, we have. Mac OS sequa simulation. We, we have. Mac OS sequa simulation. We, we have. Mac OS sequa simulation. We, have Safari and Terminal and other apps., have Safari and Terminal and other apps., have Safari and Terminal and other apps., We have Finder and stuff like that., We have Finder and stuff like that., We have Finder and stuff like that., Let's hit Safari. So, nothing is getting, Let's hit Safari. So, nothing is getting, Let's hit Safari. So, nothing is getting, opened. Okay. Okay. It did take some, opened. Okay. Okay. It did take some, opened. Okay. Okay. It did take some, time to actually it is not as smooth as, time to actually it is not as smooth as, time to actually it is not as smooth as, I expected it to be. It is kind of maybe, I expected it to be. It is kind of maybe, I expected it to be. It is kind of maybe, using a lot of resources. I'm trying to, using a lot of resources. I'm trying to, using a lot of resources. I'm trying to, close it but I'm not able to. Now I have, close it but I'm not able to. Now I have, close it but I'm not able to. Now I have, Now I've run the code again. You can see, Now I've run the code again. You can see, Now I've run the code again. You can see, it is showing us the real time. It is, it is showing us the real time. It is, it is showing us the real time. It is, 5:17 now. So it is showing that we have, 5:17 now. So it is showing that we have, 5:17 now. So it is showing that we have, the settings and you can see it is, the settings and you can see it is, the settings and you can see it is, showing the exact date and time. I'm not, showing the exact date and time. I'm not, showing the exact date and time. I'm not, able to close it though. I'm also not, able to close it though. I'm also not, able to close it though. I'm also not, able to move it. You can see I can open, able to move it. You can see I can open, able to move it. You can see I can open, up notes. It does look like the note app, up notes. It does look like the note app, up notes. It does look like the note app, but uh I'm not able to move or interact, but uh I'm not able to move or interact, but uh I'm not able to move or interact, with it. I can open up terminal. So I'm, with it. I can open up terminal. So I'm, with it. I can open up terminal. So I'm, not able to interact with uh whatever is, not able to interact with uh whatever is, not able to interact with uh whatever is, getting generated. Anyways, this is what, getting generated. Anyways, this is what, getting generated. Anyways, this is what, we have. Let's look at Opus now. Copied, we have. Let's look at Opus now. Copied, we have. Let's look at Opus now. Copied, the code and let me paste it. There are, the code and let me paste it. There are, the code and let me paste it. There are, some extra stuff I guess which we have, some extra stuff I guess which we have, some extra stuff I guess which we have, to get removed. By the way guys, it is, to get removed. By the way guys, it is, to get removed. By the way guys, it is, 5,693, 5,693, 5,693, lines of code. Absolutely insane, lines of code. Absolutely insane, lines of code. Absolutely insane, numbers. Let's see if it's actually, numbers. Let's see if it's actually, numbers. Let's see if it's actually, worth it. So, we'll run it. And I think, worth it. So, we'll run it. And I think, worth it. So, we'll run it. And I think, we have an error. It says an attribute, we have an error. It says an attribute, we have an error. It says an attribute, error. Let me first ask this to Opus if, error. Let me first ask this to Opus if, error. Let me first ask this to Opus if, it's an issue of not having a library or, it's an issue of not having a library or, it's an issue of not having a library or, integral error in the code. So, Opus is, integral error in the code. So, Opus is, integral error in the code. So, Opus is, saying this is an error and not an, saying this is an error and not an, saying this is an error and not an, installation error. So, Gemini was able, installation error. So, Gemini was able, installation error. So, Gemini was able, to generate a response whereas Opus, to generate a response whereas Opus, to generate a response whereas Opus, wasn't. So, it is going off pretty good, wasn't. So, it is going off pretty good, wasn't. So, it is going off pretty good, for Gemini. But we'll just share the, for Gemini. But we'll just share the, for Gemini. But we'll just share the, errors that Gemini had and also to Opus, errors that Gemini had and also to Opus, errors that Gemini had and also to Opus, to see if things can improve. We have, to see if things can improve. We have, to see if things can improve. We have, the updated responses. Let's look at, the updated responses. Let's look at, the updated responses. Let's look at, Gemini 3 Pro now. So we'll paste the, Gemini 3 Pro now. So we'll paste the, Gemini 3 Pro now. So we'll paste the, code and we'll run it. Okay, this is, code and we'll run it. Okay, this is, code and we'll run it. Okay, this is, what we have. Let's see if it's actually, what we have. Let's see if it's actually, what we have. Let's see if it's actually, functional. This is the finder. We are, functional. This is the finder. We are, functional. This is the finder. We are, I'm able to move it here and there., I'm able to move it here and there., I'm able to move it here and there., There's nothing in the finder. Let's, There's nothing in the finder. Let's, There's nothing in the finder. Let's, open up Safari. It says Mac OS Sakuya., open up Safari. It says Mac OS Sakuya., open up Safari. It says Mac OS Sakuya., I'm able to expand and minimize it., I'm able to expand and minimize it., I'm able to expand and minimize it., Okay. So the minimize button is not, Okay. So the minimize button is not, Okay. So the minimize button is not, working, but I'm able to expand and, working, but I'm able to expand and, working, but I'm able to expand and, close it. Let's look at the terminal., close it. Let's look at the terminal., close it. Let's look at the terminal., Let's type help. So the commands we have, Let's type help. So the commands we have, Let's type help. So the commands we have, date, clear, echo, and who am I. So, date, clear, echo, and who am I. So, date, clear, echo, and who am I. So, let's try who am I. It says root. Let's, let's try who am I. It says root. Let's, let's try who am I. It says root. Let's, type date. And you can see it shows the, type date. And you can see it shows the, type date. And you can see it shows the, current time. If we type echo, it says, current time. If we type echo, it says, current time. If we type echo, it says, no command found. Let's see if clear, no command found. Let's see if clear, no command found. Let's see if clear, works. If I hit clear, then it clears, works. If I hit clear, then it clears, works. If I hit clear, then it clears, it. Nice. We have the notes app. And we, it. Nice. We have the notes app. And we, it. Nice. We have the notes app. And we, can type anything. But nothing is, can type anything. But nothing is, can type anything. But nothing is, visible. I think the font is white as, visible. I think the font is white as, visible. I think the font is white as, well, which shouldn't have happened. Now, well, which shouldn't have happened. Now, well, which shouldn't have happened. Now, you can see if I highlight it, it shows., you can see if I highlight it, it shows., you can see if I highlight it, it shows., It should have been in black. Anyways, It should have been in black. Anyways, It should have been in black. Anyways, let's see if other things work. We have, let's see if other things work. We have, let's see if other things work. We have, file and okay, we have two options but, file and okay, we have two options but, file and okay, we have two options but, again they are in white. We have system, again they are in white. We have system, again they are in white. We have system, settings. If I click system settings by, settings. If I click system settings by, settings. If I click system settings by, clicking the Apple logo, nothing, clicking the Apple logo, nothing, clicking the Apple logo, nothing, happens. So none of this in the top is, happens. So none of this in the top is, happens. So none of this in the top is, working. This is what we have with, working. This is what we have with, working. This is what we have with, Gemini. Let's look at Opus 4.5. So I, Gemini. Let's look at Opus 4.5. So I, Gemini. Let's look at Opus 4.5. So I, asked to give it give the updated, asked to give it give the updated, asked to give it give the updated, function with Opus 4.5 instead of giving, function with Opus 4.5 instead of giving, function with Opus 4.5 instead of giving, the whole code because it is very very, the whole code because it is very very, the whole code because it is very very, long and it's going to cost me a lot, long and it's going to cost me a lot, long and it's going to cost me a lot, given the price of Opus 4.5. So I have, given the price of Opus 4.5. So I have, given the price of Opus 4.5. So I have, pasted the code. Let's run this. And, pasted the code. Let's run this. And, pasted the code. Let's run this. And, this is what we have. Let's me let me do, this is what we have. Let's me let me do, this is what we have. Let's me let me do, it full screen so you are able to, it full screen so you are able to, it full screen so you are able to, appreciate it. So finder is open. We, appreciate it. So finder is open. We, appreciate it. So finder is open. We, have documents, downloads and all these, have documents, downloads and all these, have documents, downloads and all these, things. None of it is working and it is, things. None of it is working and it is, things. None of it is working and it is, kind of obvious. It's not an issue. But, kind of obvious. It's not an issue. But, kind of obvious. It's not an issue. But, uh if I try to hit anything in the, uh if I try to hit anything in the, uh if I try to hit anything in the, favorites, nothing is working. Let's, favorites, nothing is working. Let's, favorites, nothing is working. Let's, close this and look at each of these, close this and look at each of these, close this and look at each of these, apps down here. So this is the Safari, apps down here. So this is the Safari, apps down here. So this is the Safari, app. I'm able to drag it here and there., app. I'm able to drag it here and there., app. I'm able to drag it here and there., And let's see if we are able to do it, And let's see if we are able to do it, And let's see if we are able to do it, full screen. Okay, we are able to do it., full screen. Okay, we are able to do it., full screen. Okay, we are able to do it., Let's see if we are able to minimize it., Let's see if we are able to minimize it., Let's see if we are able to minimize it., Okay, I can minimize it. And you can see, Okay, I can minimize it. And you can see, Okay, I can minimize it. And you can see, we see a white dot showing that it is, we see a white dot showing that it is, we see a white dot showing that it is, actually open. Let's look at the, actually open. Let's look at the, actually open. Let's look at the, websites that we have over here. These, websites that we have over here. These, websites that we have over here. These, are the websites which I think opus, are the websites which I think opus, are the websites which I think opus, might have generated. If I hit apple, might have generated. If I hit apple, might have generated. If I hit apple, okay, nothing is happening. So we'll try, okay, nothing is happening. So we'll try, okay, nothing is happening. So we'll try, over here. So we'll just say apple. It, over here. So we'll just say apple. It, over here. So we'll just say apple. It, says apple wikipedia. Maybe apple.com., says apple wikipedia. Maybe apple.com., says apple wikipedia. Maybe apple.com., So if I hit apple.com, this is what we, So if I hit apple.com, this is what we, So if I hit apple.com, this is what we, see. A simple implementation, but it is, see. A simple implementation, but it is, see. A simple implementation, but it is, nice. Let's look at what other options, nice. Let's look at what other options, nice. Let's look at what other options, we have. We have Google. So let's try, we have. We have Google. So let's try, we have. We have Google. So let's try, google.com. If I try google.com, here, google.com. If I try google.com, here, google.com. If I try google.com, here, you can see the google.com appears. Hi, you can see the google.com appears. Hi, you can see the google.com appears. Hi, what is buzzing? Let's try a Google, what is buzzing? Let's try a Google, what is buzzing? Let's try a Google, search. So, if I hit a Google search, search. So, if I hit a Google search, search. So, if I hit a Google search, nothing is happening. It's okay. We have, nothing is happening. It's okay. We have, nothing is happening. It's okay. We have, GitHub. So, let me try github.com. And, GitHub. So, let me try github.com. And, GitHub. So, let me try github.com. And, okay, this is what comes up. And just, okay, this is what comes up. And just, okay, this is what comes up. And just, some text. We have YouTube. So, let's, some text. We have YouTube. So, let's, some text. We have YouTube. So, let's, try YouTube. YouTube. Okay. So, it says, try YouTube. YouTube. Okay. So, it says, try YouTube. YouTube. Okay. So, it says, this is a simulated web page and we, this is a simulated web page and we, this is a simulated web page and we, don't see anything. Let's try Twitter., don't see anything. Let's try Twitter., don't see anything. Let's try Twitter., Twitter.com. Okay. Nothing is there., Twitter.com. Okay. Nothing is there., Twitter.com. Okay. Nothing is there., Reddit.com. So again nothing nice but it, Reddit.com. So again nothing nice but it, Reddit.com. So again nothing nice but it, has generated some web pages which is, has generated some web pages which is, has generated some web pages which is, nice to see. We have notes. Let's see., nice to see. We have notes. Let's see., nice to see. We have notes. Let's see., We have this content over here. Let's, We have this content over here. Let's, We have this content over here. Let's, try to bold the first line and you can, try to bold the first line and you can, try to bold the first line and you can, see it has generate converted into bold., see it has generate converted into bold., see it has generate converted into bold., Now we'll change this into italics., Now we'll change this into italics., Now we'll change this into italics., Okay. This is converted into italics., Okay. This is converted into italics., Okay. This is converted into italics., Let's underline the bottom one. Nice., Let's underline the bottom one. Nice., Let's underline the bottom one. Nice., Let's create a new note. This is opus, Let's create a new note. This is opus, Let's create a new note. This is opus, 4.5. Let's see if the search works. So, 4.5. Let's see if the search works. So, 4.5. Let's see if the search works. So, I'll try opus 4.5. And you can see it, I'll try opus 4.5. And you can see it, I'll try opus 4.5. And you can see it, only shows the note which has opus 4.5., only shows the note which has opus 4.5., only shows the note which has opus 4.5., If I get rid of it, you can see we are, If I get rid of it, you can see we are, If I get rid of it, you can see we are, able to see two nodes. Whereas I if I, able to see two nodes. Whereas I if I, able to see two nodes. Whereas I if I, click opus 4.5, it only shows the one, click opus 4.5, it only shows the one, click opus 4.5, it only shows the one, which has this. See this is the one. If, which has this. See this is the one. If, which has this. See this is the one. If, I type open 4.6, nothing is there. So, I type open 4.6, nothing is there. So, I type open 4.6, nothing is there. So, search is also functioning. Let's look, search is also functioning. Let's look, search is also functioning. Let's look, at terminal. This is what we have. Let's, at terminal. This is what we have. Let's, at terminal. This is what we have. Let's, type help to see which commands we have., type help to see which commands we have., type help to see which commands we have., So we can list directories, check for, So we can list directories, check for, So we can list directories, check for, date and all of it. So let's look at, date and all of it. So let's look at, date and all of it. So let's look at, date. So if I hit date, it shows current, date. So if I hit date, it shows current, date. So if I hit date, it shows current, date and time. Let's try who am I. Okay, date and time. Let's try who am I. Okay, date and time. Let's try who am I. Okay, it shows my name. Gemini was not able to, it shows my name. Gemini was not able to, it shows my name. Gemini was not able to, get it functional whereas Opus is able, get it functional whereas Opus is able, get it functional whereas Opus is able, to. So we'll clear this. If I hel it, to. So we'll clear this. If I hel it, to. So we'll clear this. If I hel it, actually shows all of the folders that I, actually shows all of the folders that I, actually shows all of the folders that I, have. Let's try to go into a folder CD, have. Let's try to go into a folder CD, have. Let's try to go into a folder CD, downloads and PR into downloads. And we, downloads and PR into downloads. And we, downloads and PR into downloads. And we, can see a lot of content over here., can see a lot of content over here., can see a lot of content over here., Let's make a directory named Opus 4.5., Let's make a directory named Opus 4.5., Let's make a directory named Opus 4.5., CD to Opus 4.5. So Opus 4.5 named, CD to Opus 4.5. So Opus 4.5 named, CD to Opus 4.5. So Opus 4.5 named, directory is generated in my in my, directory is generated in my in my, directory is generated in my in my, laptop I guess. Let me check it. So, laptop I guess. Let me check it. So, laptop I guess. Let me check it. So, let's head over to downloads. And you, let's head over to downloads. And you, let's head over to downloads. And you, can see actually a folder has been, can see actually a folder has been, can see actually a folder has been, generated named opus 4.5. Insane. That, generated named opus 4.5. Insane. That, generated named opus 4.5. Insane. That, is absolutely awesome. Let's move on and, is absolutely awesome. Let's move on and, is absolutely awesome. Let's move on and, let's see calculator. So this is the, let's see calculator. So this is the, let's see calculator. So this is the, calculator that we have. Let's try 30 *, calculator that we have. Let's try 30 *, calculator that we have. Let's try 30 *, 2 and it works. Let's try 10%age. It, 2 and it works. Let's try 10%age. It, 2 and it works. Let's try 10%age. It, says 0.1 40%age 0.4 - 40 + 30 gives -, says 0.1 40%age 0.4 - 40 + 30 gives -, says 0.1 40%age 0.4 - 40 + 30 gives -, 10. Nice. Calculator is working. We also, 10. Nice. Calculator is working. We also, 10. Nice. Calculator is working. We also, have clock. And you can see it shows the, have clock. And you can see it shows the, have clock. And you can see it shows the, actual time. But I'll have to say it, actual time. But I'll have to say it, actual time. But I'll have to say it, also looks like it is showing the, also looks like it is showing the, also looks like it is showing the, correct minute and hour hand as well., correct minute and hour hand as well., correct minute and hour hand as well., And you can see when it's going to be 60, And you can see when it's going to be 60, And you can see when it's going to be 60, seconds. The second hand correctly, seconds. The second hand correctly, seconds. The second hand correctly, completes a loop. That is nice. Clock is, completes a loop. That is nice. Clock is, completes a loop. That is nice. Clock is, working. We have photos and we can zoom, working. We have photos and we can zoom, working. We have photos and we can zoom, and minimize it. We have albums but I'm, and minimize it. We have albums but I'm, and minimize it. We have albums but I'm, not able to get into it. The photos are, not able to get into it. The photos are, not able to get into it. The photos are, not working. Talking about photos, we, not working. Talking about photos, we, not working. Talking about photos, we, don't see a desktop wallpaper. That, don't see a desktop wallpaper. That, don't see a desktop wallpaper. That, should have been there. Let's try music., should have been there. Let's try music., should have been there. Let's try music., And okay, you can see it's it shows, And okay, you can see it's it shows, And okay, you can see it's it shows, recently added music, blinding lights, recently added music, blinding lights, recently added music, blinding lights, levitating, good for you. See these are, levitating, good for you. See these are, levitating, good for you. See these are, many popular songs, speeches. So all, many popular songs, speeches. So all, many popular songs, speeches. So all, these albums, songs, radio and stuff is, these albums, songs, radio and stuff is, these albums, songs, radio and stuff is, not working. Let's try to play a song., not working. Let's try to play a song., not working. Let's try to play a song., Maybe it plays okay. So it is just going, Maybe it plays okay. So it is just going, Maybe it plays okay. So it is just going, past and nothing is happening. But it is, past and nothing is happening. But it is, past and nothing is happening. But it is, nice. At least the app is working. We, nice. At least the app is working. We, nice. At least the app is working. We, have the mail app, inbox and stuff like, have the mail app, inbox and stuff like, have the mail app, inbox and stuff like, that. We are not able to open the, that. We are not able to open the, that. We are not able to open the, individual messages and we have the, individual messages and we have the, individual messages and we have the, messages app. Let me try to type a, messages app. Let me try to type a, messages app. Let me try to type a, message. Okay, it is not working. I have, message. Okay, it is not working. I have, message. Okay, it is not working. I have, the launchpad option even that is not, the launchpad option even that is not, the launchpad option even that is not, working. Let's try settings and this is, working. Let's try settings and this is, working. Let's try settings and this is, system preferences. We have the option, system preferences. We have the option, system preferences. We have the option, to change light and dark mode but that, to change light and dark mode but that, to change light and dark mode but that, is not working. All these options are, is not working. All these options are, is not working. All these options are, also not working. So comparatively I'll, also not working. So comparatively I'll, also not working. So comparatively I'll, have to say that Opus 4.5 has actually, have to say that Opus 4.5 has actually, have to say that Opus 4.5 has actually, done a better job. It generated a lot of, done a better job. It generated a lot of, done a better job. It generated a lot of, code but that is a working code. Gemini, code but that is a working code. Gemini, code but that is a working code. Gemini, on the other hand you can see it tries, on the other hand you can see it tries, on the other hand you can see it tries, to align with efficiency. This is a, to align with efficiency. This is a, to align with efficiency. This is a, point for Opus 4.5. Let's move on to the, point for Opus 4.5. Let's move on to the, point for Opus 4.5. Let's move on to the, next one. Now we are asking them to, next one. Now we are asking them to, next one. Now we are asking them to, create a SVG of Cybert truck. Let's see, create a SVG of Cybert truck. Let's see, create a SVG of Cybert truck. Let's see, what we get. You can pause and have a, what we get. You can pause and have a, what we get. You can pause and have a, look at the whole prompt. Okay, we have, look at the whole prompt. Okay, we have, look at the whole prompt. Okay, we have, the responses. So this is what Gemini, the responses. So this is what Gemini, the responses. So this is what Gemini, has come up with. It looks like a, has come up with. It looks like a, has come up with. It looks like a, triangle with two wheels. I mean Cybert, triangle with two wheels. I mean Cybert, triangle with two wheels. I mean Cybert, truck is kind of an angled vehicle., truck is kind of an angled vehicle., truck is kind of an angled vehicle., Anyways, nothing much more to say. We, Anyways, nothing much more to say. We, Anyways, nothing much more to say. We, see mountains and stuff. We'll have to, see mountains and stuff. We'll have to, see mountains and stuff. We'll have to, look at Opus response and uh this is, look at Opus response and uh this is, look at Opus response and uh this is, what Opus has come up with it. I mean I, what Opus has come up with it. I mean I, what Opus has come up with it. I mean I, can see this is meant to be the you know, can see this is meant to be the you know, can see this is meant to be the you know, trunk and other than that I am not able, trunk and other than that I am not able, trunk and other than that I am not able, to make sense of anything. I mean both, to make sense of anything. I mean both, to make sense of anything. I mean both, have given a bad response I'll have to, have given a bad response I'll have to, have given a bad response I'll have to, say. I mean we can say Gemini 2.5 Pro is, say. I mean we can say Gemini 2.5 Pro is, say. I mean we can say Gemini 2.5 Pro is, better but uh even that is not good. I, better but uh even that is not good. I, better but uh even that is not good. I, think I'll give a zero to both of them., think I'll give a zero to both of them., think I'll give a zero to both of them., Let's move on to the next one. Now this, Let's move on to the next one. Now this, Let's move on to the next one. Now this, one is interesting. We are asking them, one is interesting. We are asking them, one is interesting. We are asking them, to create the best implementation of, to create the best implementation of, to create the best implementation of, hill climb raising. It is a very popular, hill climb raising. It is a very popular, hill climb raising. It is a very popular, game. They have to do this in HTML CSS, game. They have to do this in HTML CSS, game. They have to do this in HTML CSS, and JS. Let's see how they do it. So, and JS. Let's see how they do it. So, and JS. Let's see how they do it. So, this is the whole prompt. You can pause, this is the whole prompt. You can pause, this is the whole prompt. You can pause, and have a look. Okay, we have the, and have a look. Okay, we have the, and have a look. Okay, we have the, responses. So let's try off with Gemini, responses. So let's try off with Gemini, responses. So let's try off with Gemini, 3 Pro. Now we'll preview this in a new, 3 Pro. Now we'll preview this in a new, 3 Pro. Now we'll preview this in a new, page. It says hill climb physics. Let's, page. It says hill climb physics. Let's, page. It says hill climb physics. Let's, drive this. Okay, it says next snap. Try, drive this. Okay, it says next snap. Try, drive this. Okay, it says next snap. Try, again. So it is not working, guys. I, again. So it is not working, guys. I, again. So it is not working, guys.

Let's look at Opus now., Let's run this. Let's open up a file., Let's run this. Let's open up a file., Let's run this. Let's open up a file., Okay, it does show a finder for music., Okay, it does show a finder for music., Okay, it does show a finder for music., So I mean I'll have to find out the, So I mean I'll have to find out the, So I mean I'll have to find out the, music that is going to be hard for me., music that is going to be hard for me., music that is going to be hard for me., Anyways, let's do it. Okay, we have got, Anyways, let's do it. Okay, we have got, Anyways, let's do it. Okay, we have got, another song., another song., another song., &gt;&gt; I don't want to overink., &gt;&gt; I don't want to overink., &gt;&gt; I don't want to overink., Is it, something?, something?, &gt;&gt; It looks good though., &gt;&gt; It looks good though., &gt;&gt; It looks good though., &gt;&gt; Let's see if it follows the beat., you to be [music], you to be [music], open with me when I have my secrets that, open with me when I have my secrets that, open with me when I have my secrets that, I tend to keep safely [music] under law, I tend to keep safely [music] under law, I tend to keep safely [music] under law, and it's key. I'm hypocritical, and it's key. I'm hypocritical, and it's key. I'm hypocritical, [music] but [singing] at least I know we, [music] but [singing] at least I know we, [music] but [singing] at least I know we, could be beautiful, could be beautiful, could be beautiful, or maybe [music and singing], or maybe [music and singing], or maybe [music and singing], terrible., &gt;&gt; But I do personally like the, &gt;&gt; But I do personally like the, implementation that you know Gemini 3, implementation that you know Gemini 3, implementation that you know Gemini 3, came up with and also Gemini's response, came up with and also Gemini's response, came up with and also Gemini's response, is significantly smaller. Even then it, is significantly smaller. Even then it, is significantly smaller. Even then it, was able to generate this level of code., was able to generate this level of code., was able to generate this level of code., I asked Gemini 3 to update its code so, I asked Gemini 3 to update its code so, I asked Gemini 3 to update its code so, that the sensitivity is a bit reduced., that the sensitivity is a bit reduced., that the sensitivity is a bit reduced., Let's see., &gt;&gt; [music], &gt;&gt; [music], &gt;&gt; So now you can see it actually looks, &gt;&gt; So now you can see it actually looks, &gt;&gt; So now you can see it actually looks, better, doesn't it? I mean the previous, better, doesn't it? I mean the previous, better, doesn't it? I mean the previous, response was good. That is the reason I, response was good. That is the reason I, response was good. That is the reason I, didn't do a second [music] iteration, didn't do a second [music] iteration, didn't do a second [music] iteration, with Opus 4.5., &gt;&gt; [music], &gt;&gt; [music], &gt;&gt; I do like this part., So I will give this a win to Gemini 3, So I will give this a win to Gemini 3, Pro. Actually finally let's get back to, Pro. Actually finally let's get back to, Pro. Actually finally let's get back to, what we did and who actually wins. We'll, what we did and who actually wins. We'll, what we did and who actually wins. We'll, we'll be going through each question one, we'll be going through each question one, we'll be going through each question one, by one. So let's look at the first, by one. So let's look at the first, by one. So let's look at the first, question. So the first question was, question. So the first question was, question. So the first question was, generating a PS5 controller in SVG., generating a PS5 controller in SVG., generating a PS5 controller in SVG., Clearly Gemini 3 was way ahead. You can, Clearly Gemini 3 was way ahead. You can, Clearly Gemini 3 was way ahead. You can, see I've written S1 which shows that it, see I've written S1 which shows that it, see I've written S1 which shows that it, is SVG generation represented by S., is SVG generation represented by S., is SVG generation represented by S., Let's move on to Minecraft which is a, Let's move on to Minecraft which is a, Let's move on to Minecraft which is a, front- end question. Here Opus 4.5 was, front- end question. Here Opus 4.5 was, front- end question. Here Opus 4.5 was, slightly better and didn't have the, slightly better and didn't have the, slightly better and didn't have the, weird issue that Gemini 3 was having., weird issue that Gemini 3 was having., weird issue that Gemini 3 was having., Gemini 3 on its iterative response, Gemini 3 on its iterative response, Gemini 3 on its iterative response, didn't give us a better one. That is a, didn't give us a better one. That is a, didn't give us a better one. That is a, win for Opus 4.5. Let's move on to Fruit, win for Opus 4.5. Let's move on to Fruit, win for Opus 4.5. Let's move on to Fruit, Ninja. We asked to generate the game in, Ninja. We asked to generate the game in, Ninja. We asked to generate the game in, Python. I'm calling Python as back end, Python. I'm calling Python as back end, Python. I'm calling Python as back end, just to differentiate between HTML, CSS, just to differentiate between HTML, CSS, just to differentiate between HTML, CSS, and JS generation and Python generation., and JS generation and Python generation., and JS generation and Python generation., So here Gemini 3 actually did a better, So here Gemini 3 actually did a better, So here Gemini 3 actually did a better, job and didn't have the issues that Opus, job and didn't have the issues that Opus, job and didn't have the issues that Opus, 4.5 was having. Moving on to the iPhone, 4.5 was having. Moving on to the iPhone, 4.5 was having. Moving on to the iPhone, 16 Pro Max question. This was the SVG, 16 Pro Max question. This was the SVG, 16 Pro Max question. This was the SVG, generation again and actually Gemini 3, generation again and actually Gemini 3, generation again and actually Gemini 3, did a better job. You know the placement, did a better job. You know the placement, did a better job. You know the placement, of the cameras and everything in the, of the cameras and everything in the, of the cameras and everything in the, camera bump was actually better in, camera bump was actually better in, camera bump was actually better in, Gemini 3. Also the dynamic island was, Gemini 3. Also the dynamic island was, Gemini 3. Also the dynamic island was, better. Moving on to the trading, better. Moving on to the trading, better. Moving on to the trading, dashboard here. Opus 4 4.5 did a, dashboard here. Opus 4 4.5 did a, dashboard here. Opus 4 4.5 did a, phenomenal job and gave us the best, phenomenal job and gave us the best, phenomenal job and gave us the best, response that I've ever seen. Moving on, response that I've ever seen. Moving on, response that I've ever seen. Moving on, to the Mac OS simulation in Python here., to the Mac OS simulation in Python here., to the Mac OS simulation in Python here., Actually, Opus 4.5 did a better job, Actually, Opus 4.5 did a better job, Actually, Opus 4.5 did a better job, simply because it generated very long, simply because it generated very long, simply because it generated very long, code. Gemini 3 has a lot of laziness and, code. Gemini 3 has a lot of laziness and, code. Gemini 3 has a lot of laziness and, doesn't want to generate long code which, doesn't want to generate long code which, doesn't want to generate long code which, actually hinders its performance. Opus, actually hinders its performance. Opus, actually hinders its performance. Opus, 4.5, we we saw that constantly it was, 4.5, we we saw that constantly it was, 4.5, we we saw that constantly it was, generating 3,000 5,000 nearly 6,000, generating 3,000 5,000 nearly 6,000, generating 3,000 5,000 nearly 6,000, lines of code while keeping things, lines of code while keeping things, lines of code while keeping things, consistent. Moving on to the Cybertruck, consistent. Moving on to the Cybertruck, consistent. Moving on to the Cybertruck, SVG, both were not able to give us a, SVG, both were not able to give us a, SVG, both were not able to give us a, good SVG. In the hill climb racing test, good SVG.
