Description:
好的，这是根据您提供的文本内容提炼的核心思想摘要。

### **一、 大纲总结**

1.  **测试背景与目标**
    *   **核心目标：** 横向对比三款顶级AI模型（Claude Opus 4.5、Gemini 3 Pro、GPT 5.1 Codex Max），检验其从零开始独立构建一个复杂、功能完备的生产力Web应用的真实能力。
    *   **具体任务：** 创建一个包含任务管理器、番茄钟、日历视图（与任务联动）以及AI新闻源（通过RSS获取）四大核心功能的仪表盘应用。

2.  **构建过程与初步观察**
    *   **构建耗时：**
        *   **最快：** Gemini 3 Pro (7分29秒)
        *   **其次：** Codex 5.1 Max (8分58秒)
        *   **最慢：** Claude Opus 4.5 (12分2秒)
    *   **关键发现：** Opus 4.5之所以耗时最长，是因为它在构建过程中执行了详尽的自动化测试、验证和截图，展现了其他模型所不具备的卓越推理和严谨的自我修正能力。

3.  **最终成品深度评测**
    *   **Gemini 3 Pro（表现最差）：**
        *   **优点：** 核心的任务管理和番茄钟功能基本可用。
        *   **缺点：** 严重偏离需求，用“生产力提示”替代了AI新闻源；日历功能不完整，仅有日视图；UI/UX存在明显缺陷，如缺少返回按钮。
    *   **GPT 5.1 Codex Max（表现中等）：**
        *   **优点：** UI设计优于Gemini，并成功实现了月/周视图切换的日历。
        *   **缺点：** 存在关键Bug（番茄钟的暂停键会重置计时器）；AI新闻源功能完全失败；存在一些UI渲染格式问题。
    *   **Claude Opus 4.5（表现最佳）：**
        *   **优点：** 表现近乎完美。所有功能均被准确、完整地实现，是唯一成功集成RSS新闻源的模型。UI设计和用户体验在三者中最佳，代码结构清晰。
        *   **缺点：** 唯一可被视为瑕疵的是，已完成任务的状态未能实时同步到日历视图中，但这是一个非常次要的问题。

### **二、 核心结论**

尽管构建速度最慢，但Claude Opus 4.5凭借其卓越的推理能力和内置的自动化测试流程，创造出了一个功能最完整、Bug最少、用户体验最佳的应用，成为本次对比测试中毫无争议的胜出者。

### **三、 内容框架**

本文内容采用了一个经典的**产品横向对比评测 (Head-to-Head Comparison)** 框架。通过设定一个统一且复杂的编程挑战，它系统性地评估了三款主流AI模型在**真实世界应用构建**中的综合能力，涵盖了从理解需求、代码生成、功能实现到自我测试和最终交付质量的全过程，并最终基于详细的定性和定量分析，得出了明确的优胜结论。

Okay, all three, go through to build. Okay, all three, go through to build. Okay, all three, models have finished the build process., models have finished the build process., models have finished the build process., Gemini 3 Pro was the quickest to finish., Gemini 3 Pro was the quickest to finish., Gemini 3 Pro was the quickest to finish., It took 7 minutes and 29 seconds. Codeex, It took 7 minutes and 29 seconds. Codeex, It took 7 minutes and 29 seconds. Codeex, 5.1 Max was next to finish. took 8, 5.1 Max was next to finish. took 8, 5.1 Max was next to finish. took 8, minutes and 58 seconds. And finally, minutes and 58 seconds. And finally, minutes and 58 seconds. And finally, Claude Opus 4.5 took 12 minutes and 2, Claude Opus 4.5 took 12 minutes and 2, Claude Opus 4.5 took 12 minutes and 2, seconds. So, that's already an, seconds. So, that's already an, seconds. So, that's already an, interesting takeaway that Codeex was, interesting takeaway that Codeex was, interesting takeaway that Codeex was, quicker than Opus 4.5. In every other, quicker than Opus 4.5. In every other, quicker than Opus 4.5. In every other, test I've done with Codeex, it's always, test I've done with Codeex, it's always, test I've done with Codeex, it's always, been the slowest model. Another, been the slowest model. Another, been the slowest model. Another, interesting thing to note is that Opus, interesting thing to note is that Opus, interesting thing to note is that Opus, 4.5 actually did really in-depth testing, 4.5 actually did really in-depth testing, 4.5 actually did really in-depth testing, and documented that within the chat. So, and documented that within the chat. So, and documented that within the chat. So, if I scroll up here, you might be able, if I scroll up here, you might be able, if I scroll up here, you might be able, to see that it went through and tested, to see that it went through and tested, to see that it went through and tested, every single feature of the app and then, every single feature of the app and then, every single feature of the app and then, provided a screenshot of the app. So, provided a screenshot of the app. So, provided a screenshot of the app. So, you can see here there's a screenshot of, you can see here there's a screenshot of, you can see here there's a screenshot of, the AI tech news feed with that RSS, the AI tech news feed with that RSS, the AI tech news feed with that RSS, feed. It actually went and tested all of, feed. It actually went and tested all of, feed. It actually went and tested all of, these features. It opened browser mode, these features. It opened browser mode, these features. It opened browser mode, automatically, launched the app in dev, automatically, launched the app in dev, automatically, launched the app in dev, mode, and went through all of that, mode, and went through all of that, mode, and went through all of that, testing. So that is potentially why it, testing. So that is potentially why it, testing. So that is potentially why it, took that extra 3 or 4 minutes to, took that extra 3 or 4 minutes to, took that extra 3 or 4 minutes to, complete the build because it went, complete the build because it went, complete the build because it went, through thorough testing. So that's a, through thorough testing. So that's a, through thorough testing. So that's a, really interesting note. I didn't get, really interesting note. I didn't get, really interesting note. I didn't get, any sort of test results from Gemini 3, any sort of test results from Gemini 3, any sort of test results from Gemini 3, Pro or Codeex. We'll see how they, Pro or Codeex. We'll see how they, Pro or Codeex. We'll see how they, perform when we launch them in dev mode., perform when we launch them in dev mode., perform when we launch them in dev mode., But Opus 4.5 looks like it has gone, But Opus 4.5 looks like it has gone, But Opus 4.5 looks like it has gone, ahead and just done all of that in-depth, ahead and just done all of that in-depth, ahead and just done all of that in-depth, testing itself. From a code structure, testing itself. From a code structure, testing itself. From a code structure, perspective, we can see that on the left, perspective, we can see that on the left, perspective, we can see that on the left, hand side, Opus has created a total of, hand side, Opus has created a total of, hand side, Opus has created a total of, four files and about 3,500 lines of, four files and about 3,500 lines of, four files and about 3,500 lines of, code. In the middle here, we can see, code. In the middle here, we can see, code. In the middle here, we can see, codeex has created five files and a, codeex has created five files and a, codeex has created five files and a, total of,300 lines of code. And on the, total of,300 lines of code. And on the, total of,300 lines of code. And on the, right hand side, Gemini 3 Pro has, right hand side, Gemini 3 Pro has, right hand side, Gemini 3 Pro has, created 11 files and it looks like, created 11 files and it looks like, created 11 files and it looks like, roughly,00, roughly,00, roughly,00, lines of code in total. So that is the, lines of code in total. So that is the, lines of code in total. So that is the, code structure. Clearly a lot more code, code structure. Clearly a lot more code, code structure. Clearly a lot more code, has been created by Opus 4.5 which is, has been created by Opus 4.5 which is, has been created by Opus 4.5 which is, interesting to note. So interesting, interesting to note. So interesting, interesting to note. So interesting, results there. Observing the build, results there. Observing the build, results there. Observing the build, process for all three models. The, process for all three models. The, process for all three models. The, standout for me is observing Opus 4.5, standout for me is observing Opus 4.5, standout for me is observing Opus 4.5, going through that detailed testing, going through that detailed testing, going through that detailed testing, process. Running the app in dev mode, process. Running the app in dev mode, process. Running the app in dev mode, itself, taking screenshots and testing, itself, taking screenshots and testing, itself, taking screenshots and testing, every feature. That's a really, every feature. That's a really, every feature. That's a really, impressive part of the reasoning and, impressive part of the reasoning and, impressive part of the reasoning and, process that Opus 4.5 has gone through., process that Opus 4.5 has gone through., process that Opus 4.5 has gone through., So, a big tick there. We'll now jump, So, a big tick there. We'll now jump, So, a big tick there.

So today's schedule we can, see build web page and the time that we, see build web page and the time that we, see build web page and the time that we, have scheduled that for. So that's, have scheduled that for. So that's, have scheduled that for. So that's, working correctly. Let's jump back over, working correctly. Let's jump back over, working correctly. Let's jump back over, to our tasks page here and we'll just, to our tasks page here and we'll just, to our tasks page here and we'll just, tick off build web page. Let's also, tick off build web page. Let's also, tick off build web page. Let's also, change test web page to today. So we've, change test web page to today. So we've, change test web page to today. So we've, got another task for today. We'll save, got another task for today. We'll save, got another task for today. We'll save, those changes. So we've completed build, those changes. So we've completed build, those changes. So we've completed build, web page. That should be reflected at, web page. That should be reflected at, web page. That should be reflected at, the top and it is. So we can see we've, the top and it is. So we can see we've, the top and it is. So we can see we've, now got one pending task and a 50%, now got one pending task and a 50%, now got one pending task and a 50%, completion rate. We've got the date in, completion rate. We've got the date in, completion rate. We've got the date in, the top right corner which is also, the top right corner which is also, the top right corner which is also, accurate. We'll click here and we can, accurate. We'll click here and we can, accurate. We'll click here and we can, see our completed tasks. So mostly it is, see our completed tasks. So mostly it is, see our completed tasks. So mostly it is, working. It looks like a few of the, working. It looks like a few of the, working. It looks like a few of the, features haven't been built correctly, features haven't been built correctly, features haven't been built correctly, where the schedule is only a daily, where the schedule is only a daily, where the schedule is only a daily, schedule rather than a monthly and a, schedule rather than a monthly and a, schedule rather than a monthly and a, weekly toggle which is what we, weekly toggle which is what we, weekly toggle which is what we, requested. It also hasn't implemented, requested. It also hasn't implemented, requested. It also hasn't implemented, the live RSS feeds for news from those, the live RSS feeds for news from those, the live RSS feeds for news from those, websites. Instead, we've just got a, websites. Instead, we've just got a, websites. Instead, we've just got a, static productivity tip in the bottom, static productivity tip in the bottom, static productivity tip in the bottom, right. So, that's the Gemini 3 Pro, right. So, that's the Gemini 3 Pro, right. So, that's the Gemini 3 Pro, version. There's some things it's missed, version. There's some things it's missed, version. There's some things it's missed, the mark on, but it has successfully, the mark on, but it has successfully, the mark on, but it has successfully, implemented the Pomodoro timer and the, implemented the Pomodoro timer and the, implemented the Pomodoro timer and the, task manager. So, it's ticked off those, task manager. So, it's ticked off those, task manager. So, it's ticked off those, two. Let's now jump over to the Codeex, two. Let's now jump over to the Codeex, two. Let's now jump over to the Codeex, version and check that out. Okay, here, version and check that out. Okay, here, version and check that out. Okay, here, is the productivity dashboard that Codex, is the productivity dashboard that Codex, is the productivity dashboard that Codex, 5.1 Max has built. We can see we have a, 5.1 Max has built.

So it has, successfully implemented our request to, successfully implemented our request to, successfully implemented our request to, have a monthly and a weekly toggle. And, have a monthly and a weekly toggle. And, have a monthly and a weekly toggle. And, it's also got daily tasks on here as, it's also got daily tasks on here as, it's also got daily tasks on here as, well. So we can see tasks on Tuesday, well. So we can see tasks on Tuesday, well. So we can see tasks on Tuesday, November 25. We've also got our Pomo, November 25. We've also got our Pomo, November 25. We've also got our Pomo, Doro timer on the right hand side here., Doro timer on the right hand side here., Doro timer on the right hand side here., So we can see we've got focus 25, So we can see we've got focus 25, So we can see we've got focus 25, minutes, a start, and a reset button. If, minutes, a start, and a reset button. If, minutes, a start, and a reset button. If, we flick over to break, we can see that, we flick over to break, we can see that, we flick over to break, we can see that, it has a break mode here, which is set, it has a break mode here, which is set, it has a break mode here, which is set, to 5 minutes, and similar to the Gemini, to 5 minutes, and similar to the Gemini, to 5 minutes, and similar to the Gemini, 3 Pro version, we can change those, 3 Pro version, we can change those, 3 Pro version, we can change those, times. At the bottom, we have AI Tech, times. At the bottom, we have AI Tech, times. At the bottom, we have AI Tech, News. Stay ahead of the curve, but it, News. Stay ahead of the curve, but it, News. Stay ahead of the curve, but it, says unable to load AI news right now., says unable to load AI news right now., says unable to load AI news right now., I'll have a look at the back end after, I'll have a look at the back end after, I'll have a look at the back end after, we've done this first initial test, we've done this first initial test, we've done this first initial test, because I may have provided inaccurate, because I may have provided inaccurate, because I may have provided inaccurate, links for those RSS feeds which may be a, links for those RSS feeds which may be a, links for those RSS feeds which may be a, cause of that problem. I'll investigate, cause of that problem. I'll investigate, cause of that problem. I'll investigate, that before we judge. Let's first test, that before we judge. Let's first test, that before we judge. Let's first test, the Pomodoro timer. So, let's hit start., the Pomodoro timer. So, let's hit start., the Pomodoro timer. So, let's hit start., We can see it should now start counting, We can see it should now start counting, We can see it should now start counting, down. Similar to Gemini 3 Pro, we can, down. Similar to Gemini 3 Pro, we can, down. Similar to Gemini 3 Pro, we can, see the circle is filling up based on, see the circle is filling up based on, see the circle is filling up based on, the time. Let's click pause. pause, the time. Let's click pause. pause, the time. Let's click pause. pause, actually reset, actually reset, actually reset, the timer instead of just pausing it., the timer instead of just pausing it., the timer instead of just pausing it., So, there's a bug we've found. Let's, So, there's a bug we've found. Let's, So, there's a bug we've found. Let's, change the break to a minute. We'll hit, change the break to a minute. We'll hit, change the break to a minute. We'll hit, start., start., start., We can see the circle does fill up based, We can see the circle does fill up based, We can see the circle does fill up based, on the time. So, that's accurate. Again, on the time. So, that's accurate. Again, on the time. So, that's accurate. Again, the pause is resetting the timer though, the pause is resetting the timer though, the pause is resetting the timer though, instead of actually pausing it. So, instead of actually pausing it. So, instead of actually pausing it. So, there's a bug we found here with the, there's a bug we found here with the, there's a bug we found here with the, codeex version. Let's now jump over to, codeex version. Let's now jump over to, codeex version. Let's now jump over to, the left side here and I'll create a, the left side here and I'll create a, the left side here and I'll create a, task. So, again, we'll say we're going, task. So, again, we'll say we're going, task. So, again, we'll say we're going, to build a web page. We'll leave it on, to build a web page. We'll leave it on, to build a web page. We'll leave it on, today, today, today, and we'll hit add task. We can see that, and we'll hit add task. We can see that, and we'll hit add task. We can see that, gets created here in our task manager, gets created here in our task manager, gets created here in our task manager, section. It's also integrated with our, section. It's also integrated with our, section. It's also integrated with our, calendar. So we can see the dot here on, calendar. So we can see the dot here on, calendar. So we can see the dot here on, today and it is showing here for tasks, today and it is showing here for tasks, today and it is showing here for tasks, on Tuesday, November 25. We can edit, on Tuesday, November 25. We can edit, on Tuesday, November 25. We can edit, delete or tick that off. Let's add one, delete or tick that off. Let's add one, delete or tick that off. Let's add one, more task. So we'll say test web page., more task. So we'll say test web page., more task. So we'll say test web page., We'll also leave that on today., We'll also leave that on today., We'll also leave that on today., So we can see that has also been, So we can see that has also been, So we can see that has also been, populated. We'll just add one more to, populated. We'll just add one more to, populated. We'll just add one more to, see to make sure that it doesn't get, see to make sure that it doesn't get, see to make sure that it doesn't get, added here when we choose a different, added here when we choose a different, added here when we choose a different, date. So we can also choose calendar, date. So we can also choose calendar, date. So we can also choose calendar, mode here, which is a good feature that, mode here, which is a good feature that, mode here, which is a good feature that, Gemini 3 Pro didn't include. Let's say, Gemini 3 Pro didn't include. Let's say, Gemini 3 Pro didn't include. Let's say, integrate socials, integrate socials, integrate socials, for another task. We'll click add task., for another task. We'll click add task., for another task. We'll click add task., That has now added that to Wednesday. We, That has now added that to Wednesday. We, That has now added that to Wednesday. We, can flick back to today to see those, can flick back to today to see those, can flick back to today to see those, tasks. So we can flick between days here, tasks. So we can flick between days here, tasks. So we can flick between days here, to see what tasks we need to do on each, to see what tasks we need to do on each, to see what tasks we need to do on each, day. If we go back to the monthly view, day. If we go back to the monthly view, day. If we go back to the monthly view, we can also see that that is also, we can also see that that is also, we can also see that that is also, working. So that's a tick as well for, working. So that's a tick as well for, working. So that's a tick as well for, that functionality. Let's tick off this, that functionality. Let's tick off this, that functionality. Let's tick off this, task. We can see it highlights green, task. We can see it highlights green, task. We can see it highlights green, when we click on it. If we scroll up, we, when we click on it. If we scroll up, we, when we click on it. If we scroll up, we, can see three scheduled tasks and one, can see three scheduled tasks and one, can see three scheduled tasks and one, has been completed today. So when we, has been completed today. So when we, has been completed today. So when we, tick that box here, that does complete, tick that box here, that does complete, tick that box here, that does complete, the task. It doesn't put an outline, the task. It doesn't put an outline, the task. It doesn't put an outline, through it to say that we've completed, through it to say that we've completed, through it to say that we've completed, it, though. It just highlights it in, it, though. It just highlights it in, it, though. It just highlights it in, green. So, we can see that updates, green. So, we can see that updates, green. So, we can see that updates, accurately to say we've now completed, accurately to say we've now completed, accurately to say we've now completed, two. So, that's a first look at the, two. So, that's a first look at the, two. So, that's a first look at the, codeex version. The UI, in my opinion, codeex version. The UI, in my opinion, codeex version. The UI, in my opinion, is an improvement on the Gemini 3 Pro, is an improvement on the Gemini 3 Pro, is an improvement on the Gemini 3 Pro, version. The Pomodoro timer and the task, version. The Pomodoro timer and the task, version. The Pomodoro timer and the task, manager and the calendar view all work, manager and the calendar view all work, manager and the calendar view all work, except for that bug we found with the, except for that bug we found with the, except for that bug we found with the, Pomodoro timer resetting instead of, Pomodoro timer resetting instead of, Pomodoro timer resetting instead of, pausing. the AI tech news section isn't, pausing. the AI tech news section isn't, pausing. the AI tech news section isn't, working correctly and we could probably, working correctly and we could probably, working correctly and we could probably, fix up a few of the ways that the, fix up a few of the ways that the, fix up a few of the ways that the, formatting is working when we tick off a, formatting is working when we tick off a, formatting is working when we tick off a, task that we've completed. For example, task that we've completed. For example, task that we've completed. For example, maybe these completed tasks should move, maybe these completed tasks should move, maybe these completed tasks should move, into a completed bucket instead of, into a completed bucket instead of, into a completed bucket instead of, staying on our task manager here and the, staying on our task manager here and the, staying on our task manager here and the, time is off the screen. So, that's a, time is off the screen. So, that's a, time is off the screen. So, that's a, formatting issue as well. So, that's a, formatting issue as well. So, that's a, formatting issue as well. So, that's a, look at the codeex version. I'd have, look at the codeex version. I'd have, look at the codeex version. I'd have, this as an improvement over Gemini 3, this as an improvement over Gemini 3, this as an improvement over Gemini 3, Pro, but there are some bugs here that, Pro, but there are some bugs here that, Pro, but there are some bugs here that, we would need to fix. Next, we'll move, we would need to fix. Next, we'll move, we would need to fix. Next, we'll move, on to Opus 4.5. And here is the Opus 4.5, on to Opus 4.5. And here is the Opus 4.5, on to Opus 4.5. And here is the Opus 4.5, version. We can see it's actually given, version. We can see it's actually given, version. We can see it's actually given, the productivity dashboard a name, Nexus, the productivity dashboard a name, Nexus, the productivity dashboard a name, Nexus, AI. We've got our main dashboard. We've, AI. We've got our main dashboard. We've, AI. We've got our main dashboard. We've, also got calendar view at the top and AI, also got calendar view at the top and AI, also got calendar view at the top and AI, news. Also, we've then got a live timer, news. Also, we've then got a live timer, news. Also, we've then got a live timer, here, so we can see what the time is., here, so we can see what the time is., here, so we can see what the time is., We've got our tasks section here in the, We've got our tasks section here in the, We've got our tasks section here in the, middle of the screen. And then on the, middle of the screen. And then on the, middle of the screen. And then on the, right hand side, we've got our Pomodoro, right hand side, we've got our Pomodoro, right hand side, we've got our Pomodoro, timer. And then we can see today's, timer. And then we can see today's, timer. And then we can see today's, schedule at the bottom. So we've got an, schedule at the bottom. So we've got an, schedule at the bottom. So we've got an, update to see what tasks are scheduled, update to see what tasks are scheduled, update to see what tasks are scheduled, for today. Let's first test the Pomodoro, for today. Let's first test the Pomodoro, for today. Let's first test the Pomodoro, timer. So we'll click on settings and, timer. So we'll click on settings and, timer. So we'll click on settings and, see that that brings up a similar, see that that brings up a similar, see that that brings up a similar, settings section to Gemini 3 Pro where, settings section to Gemini 3 Pro where, settings section to Gemini 3 Pro where, we can change the times. We can flick, we can change the times. We can flick, we can change the times. We can flick, over to short break and long break and, over to short break and long break and, over to short break and long break and, see that they are accurate. Let's hit, see that they are accurate. Let's hit, see that they are accurate. Let's hit, start on the timer. We can see that that, start on the timer. We can see that that, start on the timer. We can see that that, is ticking down. So that's working, is ticking down. So that's working, is ticking down. So that's working, correctly. We will hit pause. We can see, correctly. We will hit pause. We can see, correctly. We will hit pause. We can see, that works. That's not resetting it like, that works. That's not resetting it like, that works. That's not resetting it like, Codeex was doing. It's actually working, Codeex was doing. It's actually working, Codeex was doing. It's actually working, as it should. So, we've pressed start, as it should. So, we've pressed start, as it should. So, we've pressed start, again. We can see it's continuing now to, again. We can see it's continuing now to, again. We can see it's continuing now to, tick down. Let's reset. We can confirm, tick down. Let's reset. We can confirm, tick down. Let's reset. We can confirm, that works. We'll flick to short break, that works. We'll flick to short break, that works. We'll flick to short break, and try that., and try that., and try that., That's also working correctly. So, the, That's also working correctly. So, the, That's also working correctly. So, the, Pomodoro timer looks like it is working, Pomodoro timer looks like it is working, Pomodoro timer looks like it is working, correctly. And visually, I think it's, correctly. And visually, I think it's, correctly. And visually, I think it's, also an improvement on Gemini 3 Pro. But, also an improvement on Gemini 3 Pro. But, also an improvement on Gemini 3 Pro. But, I think this is the best looking UI, I think this is the best looking UI, I think this is the best looking UI, design of the three productivity, design of the three productivity, design of the three productivity, dashboards. We can see the timer is, dashboards. We can see the timer is, dashboards. We can see the timer is, actually ticking down here with that, actually ticking down here with that, actually ticking down here with that, circle feature as well, which is similar, circle feature as well, which is similar, circle feature as well, which is similar, to what the other two Pomodoro timers, to what the other two Pomodoro timers, to what the other two Pomodoro timers, have. We can see that that is running, have. We can see that that is running, have. We can see that that is running, out as the time ticks down. So, out as the time ticks down. So, out as the time ticks down. So, impressive result for the Pomodoro timer, impressive result for the Pomodoro timer, impressive result for the Pomodoro timer, for Opus 4.5., for Opus 4.5., for Opus 4.5., That's a tick. We'll now flick over to, That's a tick. We'll now flick over to, That's a tick. We'll now flick over to, calendar mode. We can see we have our, calendar mode. We can see we have our, calendar mode. We can see we have our, monthly view. We can also flick to, monthly view. We can also flick to, monthly view. We can also flick to, weekly. So the weekly view is also, weekly. So the weekly view is also, weekly. So the weekly view is also, visible here. I like that the fact that, visible here. I like that the fact that, visible here. I like that the fact that, it's separated this from our main, it's separated this from our main, it's separated this from our main, dashboard. So if we want to have a look, dashboard. So if we want to have a look, dashboard. So if we want to have a look, at our monthly and weekly view, we can, at our monthly and weekly view, we can, at our monthly and weekly view, we can, do that cleanly and clearly here in its, do that cleanly and clearly here in its, do that cleanly and clearly here in its, own window in its own panel. The, own window in its own panel. The, own window in its own panel. The, dashboard is saved for task manager, dashboard is saved for task manager, dashboard is saved for task manager, pomodoro timer, and today's tasks view., pomodoro timer, and today's tasks view., pomodoro timer, and today's tasks view., So that's good. We'll flick over to AI, So that's good. We'll flick over to AI, So that's good. We'll flick over to AI, news. We can see that this looks like it, news. We can see that this looks like it, news. We can see that this looks like it, is working correctly as well. It's the, is working correctly as well. It's the, is working correctly as well. It's the, only one so far that looks like it has, only one so far that looks like it has, only one so far that looks like it has, successfully implemented this feature., successfully implemented this feature., successfully implemented this feature., So I guess we can't really give an, So I guess we can't really give an, So I guess we can't really give an, excuse to codeex max for not having this, excuse to codeex max for not having this, excuse to codeex max for not having this, working because from the prompt that we, working because from the prompt that we, working because from the prompt that we, provided it looks like opus 4.5 has, provided it looks like opus 4.5 has, provided it looks like opus 4.5 has, successfully implemented it. The, successfully implemented it. The, successfully implemented it. The, anthropic and Google AI links that I, anthropic and Google AI links that I, anthropic and Google AI links that I, provided I think were the wrong links, provided I think were the wrong links, provided I think were the wrong links, which is why we can't see any articles, which is why we can't see any articles, which is why we can't see any articles, here. that the open AI link was correct, here. that the open AI link was correct, here. that the open AI link was correct, which is why it has successfully, which is why it has successfully, which is why it has successfully, implemented that feature. The codeex, implemented that feature. The codeex, implemented that feature. The codeex, version should have been able to figure, version should have been able to figure, version should have been able to figure, that out and implement the OpenAI RSS, that out and implement the OpenAI RSS, that out and implement the OpenAI RSS, feed, which Opus 4.5 has done. I'll just, feed, which Opus 4.5 has done. I'll just, feed, which Opus 4.5 has done. I'll just, click on one of these articles to, click on one of these articles to, click on one of these articles to, confirm that it is working. We can see, confirm that it is working. We can see, confirm that it is working. We can see, that is opening an article from November, that is opening an article from November, that is opening an article from November, 25, expanding data residency access to, 25, expanding data residency access to, 25, expanding data residency access to, business customers worldwide. And we can, business customers worldwide. And we can, business customers worldwide. And we can, see that is exactly the article that is, see that is exactly the article that is, see that is exactly the article that is, featured here. So it is working, featured here. So it is working, featured here. So it is working, correctly. We'll just test one more, correctly. We'll just test one more, correctly. We'll just test one more, inside jet brains. We'll open that one, inside jet brains. We'll open that one, inside jet brains. We'll open that one, up. That is also working correctly. So, up. That is also working correctly. So, up. That is also working correctly. So, opus 4.5 has nailed this implementation., opus 4.5 has nailed this implementation., opus 4.5 has nailed this implementation., The RSS feed for our OpenAI blog for, The RSS feed for our OpenAI blog for, The RSS feed for our OpenAI blog for, tech news works. Really impressed with, tech news works. Really impressed with, tech news works. Really impressed with, this result. We'll flick back to our, this result. We'll flick back to our, this result. We'll flick back to our, dashboard now and I'll add a few tasks., dashboard now and I'll add a few tasks., dashboard now and I'll add a few tasks., So let's do exactly what we did for the, So let's do exactly what we did for the, So let's do exactly what we did for the, previous one. We can see if we click add, previous one. We can see if we click add, previous one. We can see if we click add, task. A window pops up where we can, task. A window pops up where we can, task. A window pops up where we can, enter our task. We'll say build web, enter our task. We'll say build web, enter our task. We'll say build web, page., We'll leave it for today and click save, We'll leave it for today and click save, task. That then gets added to our task, task. That then gets added to our task, task. That then gets added to our task, manager here. We'll add one more test, manager here. We'll add one more test, manager here. We'll add one more test, web page., web page., web page., And we'll change the time to 8:00 p.m., And we'll change the time to 8:00 p.m., And we'll change the time to 8:00 p.m., And click save. And then we will try one, And click save. And then we will try one, And click save. And then we will try one, more with a different date. So let's say, more with a different date. So let's say, more with a different date. So let's say, integrate socials, integrate socials, integrate socials, and we'll change the date to tomorrow, and we'll change the date to tomorrow, and we'll change the date to tomorrow, and click save. So we've got three tasks, and click save. So we've got three tasks, and click save. So we've got three tasks, here on our task manager dashboard. If, here on our task manager dashboard. If, here on our task manager dashboard. If, we click over to active, we'll see all, we click over to active, we'll see all, we click over to active, we'll see all, three completed. Doesn't have any yet., three completed. Doesn't have any yet., three completed. Doesn't have any yet., We'll see if we tick one off what, We'll see if we tick one off what, We'll see if we tick one off what, happens there. Firstly though on the, happens there. Firstly though on the, happens there. Firstly though on the, bottom right we can see today's schedule, bottom right we can see today's schedule, bottom right we can see today's schedule, 7 p.m. build web page 8 p.m. test web, 7 p.m. build web page 8 p.m. test web, 7 p.m. build web page 8 p.m. test web, page. So that is working correctly. It's, page. So that is working correctly. It's, page. So that is working correctly. It's, identified the two tasks that we've, identified the two tasks that we've, identified the two tasks that we've, scheduled for today and integrated that, scheduled for today and integrated that, scheduled for today and integrated that, into today's schedule calendar. We'll, into today's schedule calendar. We'll, into today's schedule calendar. We'll, jump over to calendar view. We can see, jump over to calendar view. We can see, jump over to calendar view. We can see, we're in weekly view here and it has, we're in weekly view here and it has, we're in weekly view here and it has, also successfully integrated the tasks, also successfully integrated the tasks, also successfully integrated the tasks, into our weekly calendar view. We can, into our weekly calendar view. We can, into our weekly calendar view. We can, see today is highlighted here and we've, see today is highlighted here and we've, see today is highlighted here and we've, got two tasks on today's view and one, got two tasks on today's view and one, got two tasks on today's view and one, task scheduled for tomorrow. If we flick, task scheduled for tomorrow. If we flick, task scheduled for tomorrow. If we flick, over to monthly, we can see we've also, over to monthly, we can see we've also, over to monthly, we can see we've also, got today's date highlighted with this, got today's date highlighted with this, got today's date highlighted with this, blue background and we've got two dots, blue background and we've got two dots, blue background and we've got two dots, here signifying two tasks and one for, here signifying two tasks and one for, here signifying two tasks and one for, the next day. If we select a day, you, the next day. If we select a day, you, the next day. If we select a day, you, can see the tasks pop up on the right, can see the tasks pop up on the right, can see the tasks pop up on the right, hand side so we can see exactly what, hand side so we can see exactly what, hand side so we can see exactly what, tasks we have scheduled. So that is also, tasks we have scheduled. So that is also, tasks we have scheduled. So that is also, a really good feature on weekly view., a really good feature on weekly view., a really good feature on weekly view., Let's just click on one and see what, Let's just click on one and see what, Let's just click on one and see what, happens. So it pops up and we can edit, happens. So it pops up and we can edit, happens. So it pops up and we can edit, the task. So we can't actually tick any, the task. So we can't actually tick any, the task. So we can't actually tick any, off from our calendar view, but we can, off from our calendar view, but we can, off from our calendar view, but we can, see what tasks are scheduled and we can, see what tasks are scheduled and we can, see what tasks are scheduled and we can, edit them if we want to. So if we want, edit them if we want to. So if we want, edit them if we want to. So if we want, to manage tasks, we can do that here., to manage tasks, we can do that here., to manage tasks, we can do that here., We'll flick back to our dashboard and, We'll flick back to our dashboard and, We'll flick back to our dashboard and, we'll tick one off. We can see the box, we'll tick one off. We can see the box, we'll tick one off. We can see the box, gets checked and a strike through. So, gets checked and a strike through. So, gets checked and a strike through. So, we've completed that task. That doesn't, we've completed that task. That doesn't, we've completed that task. That doesn't, get updated in today's schedule as being, get updated in today's schedule as being, get updated in today's schedule as being, completed. So, that's maybe something we, completed. So, that's maybe something we, completed. So, that's maybe something we, could add. If we flick over to active, could add. If we flick over to active, could add. If we flick over to active, though, we can now only see two and, though, we can now only see two and, though, we can now only see two and, completed. We have got that one ticked, completed. We have got that one ticked, completed. We have got that one ticked, off. And we've got an overview at the, off. And we've got an overview at the, off. And we've got an overview at the, bottom. Three total, one completed, two, bottom. Three total, one completed, two, bottom. Three total, one completed, two, pending. We'll flick back to calendar, pending. We'll flick back to calendar, pending. We'll flick back to calendar, mode. We can still see that there. So, mode. We can still see that there. So, mode. We can still see that there. So, potentially we could add the feature of, potentially we could add the feature of, potentially we could add the feature of, checking off these tasks in calendar, checking off these tasks in calendar, checking off these tasks in calendar, view as well when we do complete them., view as well when we do complete them., view as well when we do complete them., But that's a minor sort of update, But that's a minor sort of update, But that's a minor sort of update, compared to the actual functionality of, compared to the actual functionality of, compared to the actual functionality of, the dashboard which so far OPUS 4.5 has, the dashboard which so far OPUS 4.5 has, the dashboard which so far OPUS 4.5 has, nailed. Let's tick off all three now. So, nailed. Let's tick off all three now. So, nailed. Let's tick off all three now. So, we can see there should be no active, we can see there should be no active, we can see there should be no active, tasks. They're all in our completed, tasks. They're all in our completed, tasks. They're all in our completed, section. Now we can still see the, section. Now we can still see the, section. Now we can still see the, today's schedule with the tasks for, today's schedule with the tasks for, today's schedule with the tasks for, today. But that's a look at the Opus 4.5, today. But that's a look at the Opus 4.5, today. But that's a look at the Opus 4.5, version. Clearly this is the best of the, version. Clearly this is the best of the, version. Clearly this is the best of the, three. It has absolutely nailed the, three. It has absolutely nailed the, three. It has absolutely nailed the, brief. The only real bug I have found is, brief. The only real bug I have found is, brief. The only real bug I have found is, that it doesn't check off the items in, that it doesn't check off the items in, that it doesn't check off the items in, the calendar and on today's schedule, the calendar and on today's schedule, the calendar and on today's schedule, when they're completed. That's minor, when they're completed. That's minor, when they're completed. That's minor, though really when you think about the, though really when you think about the, though really when you think about the, tasks that we've provided here for Opus, tasks that we've provided here for Opus, tasks that we've provided here for Opus, 4.5. The Pomodoro timer works perfectly., 4.5. The Pomodoro timer works perfectly., 4.5. The Pomodoro timer works perfectly., It was the only model that successfully, It was the only model that successfully, It was the only model that successfully, integrated the OpenAI RSS feed. The, integrated the OpenAI RSS feed. The, integrated the OpenAI RSS feed. The, calendar mode is also the only one that, calendar mode is also the only one that, calendar mode is also the only one that, really has clearly and effectively, really has clearly and effectively, really has clearly and effectively, created a monthly and a weekly view here, created a monthly and a weekly view here, created a monthly and a weekly view here, and separated it from the main dashboard, and separated it from the main dashboard, and separated it from the main dashboard, which from a UI perspective is much, which from a UI perspective is much, which from a UI perspective is much, better than what Codex did where it's, better than what Codex did where it's, better than what Codex did where it's, built it all into this the one screen., built it all into this the one screen., built it all into this the one screen., And on our main dashboard, I think we've, And on our main dashboard, I think we've, And on our main dashboard, I think we've, got a really good task manager we can, got a really good task manager we can, got a really good task manager we can, use here. It works perfectly. We've got, use here. It works perfectly. We've got, use here. It works perfectly. We've got, all active and completed and we've got a, all active and completed and we've got a, all active and completed and we've got a, today's schedule and the Pomodoro timer., today's schedule and the Pomodoro timer., today's schedule and the Pomodoro timer., So, a big tick for Opus 4.5. We could go, So, a big tick for Opus 4.5. We could go, So, a big tick for Opus 4.5. We could go, back and prompt and see what else the, back and prompt and see what else the, back and prompt and see what else the, models come up with. But from a oneshot, models come up with. But from a oneshot, models come up with. But from a oneshot, view, I think this is a really, view, I think this is a really, view, I think this is a really, interesting takeaway. The process that, interesting takeaway. The process that, interesting takeaway. The process that, Opus 4.5 went through to test as part of, Opus 4.5 went through to test as part of, Opus 4.5 went through to test as part of, that build process and provide, that build process and provide, that build process and provide, screenshots of testing has clearly been, screenshots of testing has clearly been, screenshots of testing has clearly been, a big benefit because we haven't found, a big benefit because we haven't found, a big benefit because we haven't found, any bugs and pretty much everything, any bugs and pretty much everything, any bugs and pretty much everything, works. So, that's a really big tick for, works. So, that's a really big tick for, works. So, that's a really big tick for, Opus 4.5. Codeex was okay. I don't mind, Opus 4.5. Codeex was okay. I don't mind, Opus 4.5. Codeex was okay. I don't mind, the UI, but there were a few bugs we, the UI, but there were a few bugs we, the UI, but there were a few bugs we, found such as the Pomodoro timer and the, found such as the Pomodoro timer and the, found such as the Pomodoro timer and the, formatting of the time here in Task, formatting of the time here in Task, formatting of the time here in Task, Manager and Gemini 3 Pro. I think this, Manager and Gemini 3 Pro. I think this, Manager and Gemini 3 Pro. I think this, is probably performed the worst out of, is probably performed the worst out of, is probably performed the worst out of, the three. It completely missed the RSS, the three. It completely missed the RSS, the three. It completely missed the RSS, feed feature. And there's a few bugs as, feed feature. And there's a few bugs as, feed feature. And there's a few bugs as, well that we identified, such as not, well that we identified, such as not, well that we identified, such as not, being able to get back to the dashboard, being able to get back to the dashboard, being able to get back to the dashboard, page and having to refresh every time., page and having to refresh every time., page and having to refresh every time., So, that's a look at the three, So, that's a look at the three, So, that's a look at the three, productivity dashboards and these three, productivity dashboards and these three, productivity dashboards and these three, models head-to-head.
