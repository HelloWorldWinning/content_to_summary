Description:
好的，这是根据您提供的文本内容提炼和总结的核心要点。

### **核心思想纲要**

1.  **引言：Gemini 3 Pro 的优势**
    *   模型具备出色的高级推理能力和复杂指令遵循能力。
    *   这些特性使其成为构建“代理式操作”（Agentic Operations）和强大 AI 代理的理想选择。

2.  **第一阶段：环境搭建与项目初始化**
    *   **项目设置**：创建一个空的项目文件夹。
    *   **包管理器**：使用 `uv`（一个 Python 包管理器）初始化项目。
    *   **安装依赖**：添加项目所需的两个核心库：`Google ADK` 和 `Google's JDI`。
    *   **API 密钥配置**：从 Google AI Studio 获取 API 密钥，并通过命令行 `export` 命令将其设置为环境变量。
    *   **激活环境**：启动项目的 Python 虚拟环境。

3.  **第二阶段：AI 代理的创建与定制**
    *   **生成代理框架**：使用 ADK 的命令 `ADK create <agent_name>` 快速生成代理的基本文件结构（脚手架）。
    *   **选择模型**：在命令行提示中，选择 Gemini 3 Pro作为代理的核心模型。
    *   **代码定制 (`agent.py`)**：
        *   清除默认的样板代码。
        *   从 ADK 官方文档中复制一个使用 Google 搜索工具的示例代码作为基础。
        *   **核心修改**：
            1.  将模型名称从旧版本更改为 Gemini 3 Pro。
            2.  提供更详细、更具体的指令集，要求代理在回答时隐式引用其信息来源。
            3.  导入 `asyncio` 库以支持异步操作。

4.  **第三阶段：部署、交互与能力分析**
    *   **部署**：在终端中运行命令，将本地开发的代理部署到 ADK Web 平台。
    *   **交互测试**：通过 ADK Web 提供的链接与代理进行实时对话（示例：询问关于在多伦多学习马术课程的信息）。
    *   **“思维链”分析**：
        *   通过 ADK Web 的“事件(Events)”标签页，可以深入探查模型的思考过程。
        *   **思想签名 (Thought Signature)**：观察 Gemini 模型理解上下文和规划行动的方式。
        *   **行为溯源**：查看代理为生成答案实际搜索过的网站和使用的具体网络搜索查询词条。
        *   **推理过程**：分析代理如何从一个宽泛的初始查询（如“多伦多马术课程”）逐步深入到更具体、更精细的查询（如“多伦多市中心附近的马术”、“最佳马术学校”、“是否支持公共交通”等），展示了其强大的链式思考和解决问题的能力。

---

### **核心结论**

利用 Gemini 3 Pro 的高级推理能力和 ADK 开发套件，开发者可以快速构建、部署并分析能够执行复杂、多步任务的强大 AI 代理。

---

### **内容的总览框架**

这是一个**端到端的 AI 代理快速原型开发框架**，它涵盖了从**①环境准备**、**②基于模板的代码定制**、**③一键式云端部署**，到**④真实场景交互**，并最终**⑤通过可视化工具深入分析其内部“思维链”工作流**的完整生命周期。

So this text is what is being, the text. So this text is what is being, the text. So this text is what is being, returned by the model., returned by the model., returned by the model., And then if we go over to the next, And then if we go over to the next, And then if we go over to the next, event, we get to see something very, event, we get to see something very, event, we get to see something very, interesting which is the thought, interesting which is the thought, interesting which is the thought, signature of Gemini. And the thought, signature of Gemini. And the thought, signature of Gemini. And the thought, signature in Gemini 3 Pro helps the, signature in Gemini 3 Pro helps the, signature in Gemini 3 Pro helps the, model to understand the context in the, model to understand the context in the, model to understand the context in the, conversation. We also see some really, conversation. We also see some really, conversation. We also see some really, interesting data which is the websites, interesting data which is the websites, interesting data which is the websites, that Gemini 3 Pro actually searched. So, that Gemini 3 Pro actually searched. So, that Gemini 3 Pro actually searched. So, horseport.com, the best toronto.com, horseport.com, the best toronto.com, horseport.com, the best toronto.com, Reddit and many many more. And then if, Reddit and many many more. And then if, Reddit and many many more. And then if, we scroll further, we actually see the, we scroll further, we actually see the, we scroll further, we actually see the, web search queries that Gemini 3 Pro, web search queries that Gemini 3 Pro, web search queries that Gemini 3 Pro, does and in what order. So first it, does and in what order. So first it, does and in what order. So first it, starts off by doing a generic search for, starts off by doing a generic search for, starts off by doing a generic search for, horse riding lessons Toronto. And then, horse riding lessons Toronto. And then, horse riding lessons Toronto. And then, it digs deeper and does uh horseback, it digs deeper and does uh horseback, it digs deeper and does uh horseback, riding near downtown Toronto and then, riding near downtown Toronto and then, riding near downtown Toronto and then, followed by best horse riding schools, followed by best horse riding schools, followed by best horse riding schools, Toronto. And at that point, I'm sure it, Toronto. And at that point, I'm sure it, Toronto. And at that point, I'm sure it, determines some of the names of the, determines some of the names of the, determines some of the names of the, horse riding schools available in that, horse riding schools available in that, horse riding schools available in that, area. So you see the searches actually, area. So you see the searches actually, area. So you see the searches actually, start to get way more specific. And then, start to get way more specific. And then, start to get way more specific. And then, it even looks up if it's accessible by, it even looks up if it's accessible by, it even looks up if it's accessible by, public transit, which is very, public transit, which is very, public transit, which is very, interesting. And then it also looks up, interesting. And then it also looks up, interesting. And then it also looks up, on the status of whether these stables, on the status of whether these stables, on the status of whether these stables, are actually open. So from just a single, are actually open. So from just a single, are actually open. So from just a single, prompt of where can I learn horseback, prompt of where can I learn horseback, prompt of where can I learn horseback, riding in Toronto, Gemini 3 was able to, riding in Toronto, Gemini 3 was able to, riding in Toronto, Gemini 3 was able to, go through this chain of thought, go through this chain of thought, go through this chain of thought, thinking in order to arrive at this, thinking in order to arrive at this, thinking in order to arrive at this, response. And I think that's pretty, response. And I think that's pretty, response. And I think that's pretty, cool. There's so many more amazing, cool. There's so many more amazing, cool. There's so many more amazing, agents that you can build with Gemini 3, agents that you can build with Gemini 3, agents that you can build with Gemini 3, Pro and ADK. If you're interested in, Pro and ADK. If you're interested in, Pro and ADK. If you're interested in, learning more, check out the links in, learning more, check out the links in, learning more, check out the links in, the description box below.
