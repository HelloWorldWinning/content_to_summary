Description:
好的，这是对所提供文本的核心思想进行的结构化总结。

### **一、 核心论点：多做 (More)**

*   “多做”是作者在商业和生活中反复验证并取得成功的核心策略。
*   对于大多数企业和个人而言，突破瓶颈的答案不是寻找“更好”或“全新”的方法，而是将当前有效的事情以压倒性的数量去执行。人们往往严重低估了成功所需的工作量，以及自身能够承受的工作量。

### **二、 为什么“多做”是最佳策略？**

1.  **最高风险调整后回报 (Highest Risk-Adjusted Return):**
    *   与其冒险尝试成功率极低的新事物，不如将资源加倍投入到已被验证有效的模式中，这是最稳妥的增长方式。
2.  **数量本身就是一种质量 (Quantity has a quality unto itself):**
    *   当投入的量级达到某个临界点时，它本身就会转变为一种“质”的优势，形成难以逾越的竞争壁垒。
3.  **“改变”的隐性成本高昂:**
    *   任何改变都会带来一个几乎确定的业绩下滑期（约20%），而回报却是不确定的，且往往微乎其微。
    *   频繁地改变会让企业长期处于潜力之下的低效运行状态。相反，坚持重复做同一件事能带来技能的精深和复利效应。

### **三、 “最大化者” vs “优化者”的心态差异**

*   **优化者 (Optimizer):**
    *   **问题:** “如何用最少的投入获得尽可能多的产出？”
    *   **焦点:** 关注**相对回报**和效率。
    *   **结果:** 容易陷入对细枝末节的过度优化（如将转化率从30%提升到35%），从而限制了业务的规模化增长。
*   **最大化者 (Maximizer):**
    *   **问题:** “我如何才能获得尽可能多的总产出？”
    *   **焦点:** 关注**绝对回报**和总量。
    *   **信念:** 他们明白“边际递减的收益仍然是收益”。为了更高的总产出，愿意接受较低的效率。在竞争中，最终是最大化者胜出。

### **四、 如何实践“多做”？**

1.  **转变思维:**
    *   不要问“冰箱里有什么菜可以做什么？”，而要问“我到底想吃什么？”，然后去寻找相应的食材。即，先确定宏大的目标，再倒推出实现该目标所需要投入的巨大工作量。
2.  **挑战极限:**
    *   如果你想超越竞争对手，仅仅匹配他们可见的努力是远远不够的。你必须做到他们10倍、20倍甚至更多的量，以覆盖那些你看不见的努力，并确保胜利。
3.  **具体应用 (以营销为例):**
    *   **付费广告:** 按低风险到高风险顺序：制作**更多**的广告素材 -> 投入**更多**的资金 -> 拓展**更多**的平台。
    *   **内容创作:** 创作**更多**的内容。巨大的工作量会反向逼迫你提升效率，并从数据中找到更优解。

---

### **核心观点总结 (Core Point)**

要实现非凡的成功，就必须放弃对“平衡”和“捷径”的幻想，以一种不合常理的、压倒性的巨大投入量，持续不断地去做那些已经被验证有效的事情。

### **整体框架 (Overarching Framework)**

该内容的核心框架是 **“最大化策略 vs 优化策略” (Maximization vs. Optimization)** 的对立。作者明确指出，在追求卓越成就的道路上，以“多做”为核心的**最大化策略**，远胜于追求效率和新奇的**优化策略**，因为它能带来最高的风险调整后回报和最终的胜利。

I have used one strategy to win repeatedly across 13 years in business and also outside of business. And it's one of the biggest reasons that we had a $105 million launch for $100 million money miles in 72 hours for my latest book. And I'm going to explain why it's the highest risk adjusted return move that you can make to win more in business or just win more in life. And so if you're not sure what to do right now within your specific business, no matter what industry or size business you're in or whatever goal you're pursuing, this will help. I talk about more better new a lot, but I want to dive into the one that is near and dear to my heart, the one that has made me the man that I am, which is more. And I want to talk about that because the fundamental question that every single business owner needs to answer and even every person pursuing any skill or endeavor needs to answer is why can't I do more? And for most people, doing more is the answer. And it's far more common that it is more. What's very sneaky about more is that you get to a point and then you say there's no way I can do more. And at that point is where the big unlocks in volume really occur. Napoleon had this really great quote back in the day and maybe it's misattributed to him, but he said, quantity has a quality unto itself. Meaning like if you do so much volume, you do so much work and in the military sense, if you just have so many people at some point, it almost takes on its own quality of the amount of work, the amount of people, the amount of volume that you're putting into something, whatever it is that you want to break through. So big picture, I wanted to give you a couple cool little anecdotes to reinforce this. Some of you guys know about Charon, he was on the live with me, he's our president at ACQ. I don't tell you two stories about Charon. I'll tell you the moment where like we went from being friends to me being like, man, I really want him to be, you know, president of acquisition.com. So he was talking about how he was growing real. And so real was a $200 million per year business. And he had grown it from $200 million to $1.2 billion in less than three years, like 30 months. And I want to put that there as a moment for you guys to think about that, how insane that is. $200 million to $1.2 billion, less than three years. How does he do it? We're having dinner. And he says, I just did 260 events in the last 365 days. And I was like, what do you mean? And he was like, I flew around and I did every single real estate event. I spoke on every single stage. And that's how I generated, you know, more demand for our platform, for real search. And when he said that to me at dinner, I was like, this guy, he gets it. Now we've been friends for years, but seeing him so tactically involved in the business and being like, that was the thing that took a $200 million to $1.2 million, just sheer volume. Now most people might hear that and think, well, yeah, I speak on stages one time a month. And you know, I mean, I'm on stages all the time. It's like, no, no, you're not on stages all the time. You have no idea what being on stages all the time actually means. Most business owners wildly underestimate the amount of volume, one that is required and two that they are capable of. Your capability is always higher than what is required. But the thing is that you might not know it yet. And so I've had so many times in my life that it's become my de facto operating principle. And so I wanna read you this. This is from my internal sales handbook that I have for my sales team. This is the culture of acquisition.com. Like we ask, how can we do more? Many people say they wanna be in the top 1% or 0.1%, or even 0.01%. But saying that has zero bearing on whether it happens. Achievement comes from actions, not aspirations. So let's get real. To be the top 1%, you need to enter room of 100 people and leave number one. To be the top 0.1%, you need to enter room of 1000 people, like a local high school and leave number one. To be the top 0.01%, you need to enter an arena of 10,000 people and leave number one. Think about it, a stadium. And in a battle to the death in that stadium, you have to come out on top. You beat everyone, not almost everyone, everyone. And so if you have the goal to be in the top 0.01%, do you think that you can live a normal life? Do you think that you can keep the same friends? Do you think that you can keep the same hobbies? Do you think you can stay up late and sleep in on weekends? Do you think that you don't have to sacrifice what average people care about? Do you think that they will support you when you start to pass them? Do you think anyone will think this is healthy, balanced or logical? No, and they're right, but it doesn't matter. When you want to be the point 0.01%, there's no greater waste of time than explaining stuff to people who actively don't support you. It's normal for people to not understand why you do what you do. I say this because you cannot make yourself exceptional and live a normal life. To make yourself exceptional, you must live an exceptional life. And an exceptional life does not always mean better. It just means that it's so different that most people will reject it. And when that happens, you must reject them as well. Oil and water do not mix. That is what it really means to be exceptional. You must become the exception. So I routinely get asked the secret to success. And it just comes down to this. Number one, get better. Number two, never stop. If you do only those two things, you will win on a long enough time horizon. The problem is people convince themselves they no longer want something once they see the experience of how hard it really is. So I want to set this expectation for you as you head off to practice scripts, mark your calendar and set your alarms. The work begins when your motivation ends. Just win. That's from our internal handbook that we have at ACQ for our sales guys. And I want to read that to you because I want to frame what I'm talking about today. It seems like a very simple thing, just saying, just do more. But it's almost become an art form and something that I have a deep passion about, which is very odd to say. But more actually has the highest risk and justice return move that you can possibly make within the business. The reason more has the highest risk or justice return for a business or for you is that it's so hard to get something to work. Many of you guys have tried anything. You've been in marketing channel, a new sales script, a new offer. You try a bunch of things. And then finally, something works. The likelihood that you changing that thing and that next thing working is actually statistically very low. Think about how many different things you had to try before something actually worked. And so the idea is, okay, I have these limited resources. I can allocate them to take a risk and roll the dice. Or I have this thing that I know works and I need to jam more into that machine, which is why the highest risk and justice return move. Now, one of the other misconceptions that I think is that there's a huge preponderance of people who talk about optimization, getting as much as you can for as little as you can. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. The difference is that there are optimizers and there are maximizers. Maximizers try to ask the question, how do I get as much as I possibly can? Optimizers ask, how do I get as much as I can out of as little as I can? When you're looking at returns, maximizers win. So what's the difference between first place, gold in the Olympics and second in the Olympics? Silver, right? A tenth of a second in a race. But what is the realistic difference, the real world or pragmatic difference between being the best in the world and second best? And so when you're talking to an Olympian, you're talking to somebody who wants to be the top 1%, 0.01%, 0.0001%, diminishing returns are still returns. You need to do more because you're trying to win, not be cute about saying that you had great returns. And I say this to somebody who was a converted optimizer. So in the earlier part of my life, I really prided myself on doing school with as little work as possible. I was like, you nerds, I was like, you guys needed to study, I can walk in and hit a 91 with no study. And I'll tell you the story that really, really changed my life. So this guy named Kemp not, he was like, and hopefully Kemp, you know, maybe you'll see this. I gave Kemp a hard time. I did when I was in high school. And he was a kid who didn't catch on to stuff as fast. And you know, it kept a successful guy, now he's done great. But this thing happened. So all of high school, I kind of gave this guy a hard time. And when we went to go apply to colleges, I wanted to go to Duke. So Duke's the top five school in the US and I didn't get into Duke. I ended up going to Vanderbilt, which is also obviously a great school, but I wanted to go to Duke. And guess who got into Duke? Kemp not. And so what was really interesting is that this whole time, like Kemp would go to study hall, he'd be like, teach you, you forgot to assign his homework. Like he was that guy, right? And I honestly just really disliked him. But mostly because it probably just reminded me of my own inadequacies of like, I was just unwilling to do the amount of work that he was. And I, I, I shamed him for doing the amount of work that he did. I was like, you have to work so hard just to try and, just try and come close to me, right? But in the end, he got into the better college. And so it was this really humbling lesson for me that none of the colleges cared that I worked less than him. They just cared about who had the best applications and who had the best grades. And it was this really like very eye-opening experience. And so when I went to college, I had a different frame that I was like, well, I'm not gonna lose. I wanna go here and I wanna maximize. I wanna study all the hours of the day that I'm not in class, at the gym or at the cafeteria. I'm in the library and you can ask anyone that ever went to school if you ever meet them. Like, that's where I was. I was in the library 12 hours a day because I was like, well, if I just study more than everyone, I'll get good grades. And that worked out pretty good. That's just kind of a, just a little bit of framing around why I have such a, such a strong affinity for more. Now, I'll give you a second, kind of a little bit more heady reason. So I talked about how more is the highest risk you just returned. I talked about how diminishing returns are still returns. They're still output, right? The next piece though is that change has a fixed cost and a variable reward. All right, so let me explain what that means. So I want you to imagine that this line right here, ooh, nice and wet. Okay, so I've got this line. This represents your revenue or whatever your current level of activity or output is. Okay, now, what happens is most entrepreneurs, they say, you know what, I'm gonna change something. They think they're gonna change something and things are gonna get better, right? You tweak something, you mess around, you change your page, change your script, change your onboarding process, whatever, right? So then what happens? Well, if there's people involved, typically output will go down. You have to retrain the team, they have to practice. This variable affected two other variables you didn't know about. And this is completely based on my observation. You typically get about a 20% decrement or decrease in performance. What ends up happening after that is it might not work and then you stay here or it might be worse and this goes here, where it might get better and it comes back up eventually, right? And then maybe you have a 5% higher output here. This is now your new baseline. Now, here's the thing. If you have a 20% guaranteed decrease and you have the potential for a 5% increase, do you take that bet? No, but I see entrepreneurs every day, myself included for many years, taking that bet over and over again, because I was like, I just have to get better. I just have to get it better. But it was a fallacy. It's not true. Sometimes, like your business will never be perfect and you have to accept that fact. It will not be perfect. And the thing is, is you don't even know if it's gonna get better. You just aren't sure if it's cool, good enough, and so you just wanna change it. You wanna mess with it, right? But the magic is the compounding returns you get when you do the same thing over and over again. You get this depth of understanding, this depth of skill that happens with repetition, right? If necessity is the mother of invention, repetition is the father of skill. But let's look at what entrepreneurs will normally do. Maybe they'll start seeing some increase here, but what do they do next? They say, you know what? I've got this other idea I have. And so then they get another 20% decrease. And so they're constantly living significantly below their output means or your revenue or whatever your thing is below what your potential is because you're constantly changing stuff. And I wanna be real with you for a second. If you're a small business owner, you've got maybe 10, maybe 20 employees, or if you're anything less than that, then like hear me right now. The amount of resources that you have to implement change are so limited. I pick like one big thing a year that I do, like one. And what happens is when you realize how limited your resources are in order to deploy successfully a new change or a new experiment, what happens is it forces prioritization. It forces you to focus on what things, if I only had one thing that I could do this year, what one thing would I be like, this is the bet I'm gonna take? Well, it certainly wouldn't be a 5% thing, right? Well, maybe we've right-hand ridden cards, we'll get a 5% increase in referrals, maybe, right? But given those resources, what else could you do? And so when you look at the whole thing, the whole spectrum, and this is how I wanna frame strategy for you around this. Most people think about business strategy. I got this from Charon, I love this. I'm using it all the time, it's so good. Most people think about business strategy like they think about making dinner. So they go to their kitchen, they open up the fridge, the liquids inside say, what am I gonna whip up, right? That's how they think about business strategy. But the question that we should be asking is it what am I gonna whip up from what's inside the fridge? We should ask the question, what the f*** do I wanna eat? And then go get the ingredients and go make it happen. When you're saying, I'm only gonna take one bet or two bets this year, they're gonna be material, then it forces you to be like, it's gotta be worth it. Because here's the part that no one else knows. If you change nothing, believe it or not, people get better at their jobs. They get more skilled. And so you'll typically have one, two, three percent increases that happen kind of month over month from you just not changing anything, from just leaving it alone. And so this has taken me so much time because I'm a natural, I'm a yes hinge, right? I'm like, let's do it, let's shake it up. But why? Because the times I've made the most money in my life have not been when I've been changing the most. It's actually when the business has been really boring and we're just blocking and tackling and doing it over and over again. And so this is something that some people never learn. Honestly, a lot of entrepreneurs never learn this. And the hard question, the hard problem to solve is not the new idea that you wanna try. It's how can I do more once I've already exhausted my existing way of doing more? So for me, the minimum rule is that it's gotta be over 20% if I'm gonna get a 20% loss guaranteed, right? Of course. But I don't even know if I'm gonna get this 20% because we have to analyze this through, this is an investor frame, by the way. It's called ICE, right? Which is impact, which is like how big, right? Confidence is how likely. And then ease is what are the resources required for us to make this thing happen, right? Now, the perfect rule is something that's gigantic impact, gigantic confidence and super easy, right? That'd be the best type of thing. And so when we have a risk adjust return move, we think, okay, I think this could double the business. I have super high confidence and I think it could be easy. Then those are the types of bets we wanna take. Because, said differently, if you know that something could double your business with one move, why would you do three? Just because you have this compulsion to be busy, to mess with your team, doesn't mean it's what the business requires. And so a lot of people use the business to satisfy their own ADD, to satisfy their own need for novelty when the business thrives on same. It's very rare that your Kodak and you need to adjust to the digital world. It's very rare. We love to tell these stories. But what we don't tell is the guy who just said, you know what, I've got three levels of my membership and we're doing a million dollars a year. How do I 10X my traffic and get to 10 million dollars a year? And then once I'm there, what do I need to do to get to another 10X of traffic, to get to a hundred million dollars a year? We don't ask those questions. Because one of the fallacies of the pains of small business owners is that we and I self included, right, we consistently think small. We don't think big enough. And so let me give you an example on this, right? So let's say, this is where people get obsessed to brand optimization. They get obsessed around relative returns rather than absolute returns. So let's say that you've got a marketing campaign where you put a hundred dollars in and you get, call it, let's say you get a thousand dollars out. Okay, so this is 10 to one. Amazing, right? Cool. But as soon as you scale to $200, let's say that you now are getting six to one. So you get $1,200, which is pretty bad. You know, you spend twice as much money and you only made $200 more, right? Most people would say, oh, I should stop doing this. The maximizer says, we made more money. Net net, we made 900 here, thousand minus hundred. Here, we made a thousand. This is still more. And this is what people miss out on. And so what happens is when you're a small business owner, you get obsessed with these relative returns. And there's a point where you do want really high relative returns, you want a big, high LTV to CAC and we can get them some of that stuff. But I wanna just put it in this from a larger thinking perspective because I will see people stay in these optimization loops for years. You know, my opt-in page converts at 30%, right? This is my opt-in. And they'll just keep testing it, trying to get it to 35 or 40 or 45%. But the thing is, it's like, you will never 10x your business by getting this 30% will never go. It will never go to 300%. It's never gonna happen. But you can 10x your inputs. You can do more. You can do more and you can send more in and then that will for sure increase your output even if your relative return goes down. If I had the choice between spending $10,000 and making a hundred back 10 to one, or spending a million dollars and getting two million dollars back, two to one, I would take a million in to get two back every day that we can twice on Sunday. Why? Because it's more. It's still more. It's absolute returns. Absolute output. When you're thinking about yours, and I'll bring this to business now, right? I mean, I've been talking about business but like more to business, more tactical. We have our core four, right? We have our four ways of getting customers. We've got our warm outreach. We've got our cold outreach. We've got content. And then we've got paid, right? We have paid ads. These are the only four things that you can do. How do we do more, right? So from an ads perspective, we'll start here. More can simply mean more money. It could also mean more creative. It could mean more platforms. All of these things are versions of more. And so I will typically do this in reversed order of risk, right? And so that means that I think that if I'm gonna, if I'm gonna put this in order for paid, it'd be like, okay, well, the first I'm gonna do is make more creative. If I have more creative, I have a higher chance of getting more winners. If I have more winners, then I'm gonna get better ROAS and I'll be able to scale to more markets, more have a charge, more segments. Great. So that's the first more I'm gonna do. The second more I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say, I'm gonna spend more money on ads. How can I take my $100 a day and spend it for $1,000 a day? What stops you from doing that? And then third, if I do step one and step two and I make way more creative and I spend more money, then at that point, I say, okay, now that I built this machine that can create 10 times the creative volume, how do I do this within the context of Instagram? Or how do I do this in context of TikTok? Or how do I do this in the context of X, right? Each of these platforms. So some of you guys don't know this, but for the launch, for the Money Models launch, this puppy, right? So for this guy, the reason we were gonna do 105 point, whatever million at the launch is because we advertised so much, right? So we did, I think 2,000 plus ads before the six weeks out began. We had banked those 2,000 ads, 2,000, like count to 100 and then do that 20 times. And if you counted it, and be like, wow, this is really boring. That's how long it takes to count to 2,000. We made 2,000 ads, which takes significantly longer than counting to 2,000. And so this is what people dramatically misunderstand is the amount of work it takes to do more. Because then I could say, well, my editor, I only have five editors. They can only do five ads a day each, and I think that's 25 ads a day, is all we can put out. Well, if I got to 2,000 ads, do I think that I'd have a higher likely of hitting this big goal? Yes, what would it take? So it turned out, when we did the math, it took 15 editors. And so that means that we had to contract 10 more to do the editing. What does that cost? A lot less than 105 million. So we did it. So we figure out what would it take to get this big goal in terms of volume? And then what are the resources required to do that? And then is it worth it? And most times the answer is a resounding yes. Not a small yes. A big ass yes. And so then we say then what's stopping us? And the answer is almost always nothing. Just do more. Now, that's how I would attack paid from a more perspective, right? From a content perspective, it's the same thing in terms of scaling editors. Now, one of the interesting things about doing more is so painful. It's so much work. It's a lot of work to do more. But that pain forces another forcing function, which is you will try and minimize how much work you're doing. Or at least you will try and get more. If you have a fixed work, like I'm gonna do 100 calls no matter what, I'm gonna do 100 minutes of content no matter what, what do you think happens? You think, man, it'd be really nice if I got higher pickup rates. So then you start looking at your time and saying, you know, people pick up more in the afternoons from my market. Or they pick up really hot between five and seven a.m. in this particular market, whatever, assuming you're following the law, whatever. You start getting better. You start looking at the data. You start saying, like, if I'm gonna do all this work, I might as well make it worth it, right? But you have to put yourself in that pain, that pain of the lack of leverage, the pain of it being inefficient. But you have to keep it there because what happens is otherwise, it's like the weak-minded, the weak of will, will do 100 for one day or two days in the run. They'll say, I didn't get the result I wanted. So it's like duh. Of course you didn't. You didn't do nearly enough. And so this is why I think people stay small. They get obsessed with the margin. They get obsessed with the relative returns. They get obsessed with the optimization. But sometimes you just have to do a violent, unreasonable amount of work for an extended period of time because part of volume is the consistency associated with it. We couldn't make 2,000 ads in a day. We had to make 25 or 50 ads. We had to do it every single day for hundreds of days in a row to get to the point where we could make 2,000. Right? And that was before we started. We ended up, what, with 3,000? 2,800. We made 2,800 ads. But we're like, man, I can't scale my aspects to certain. You don't have enough. We spent 500,000 a day per day at the end of the launch. Last few days. And you can only get to that level of scale with an equal amount of scale in terms of the inputs. This is probably my favorite volume story that I have because it was so real for me. I paid somebody who was way bigger than me at the time in terms of content and all that stuff early on in my career. And I was like, hey, what should I do? And he was like, dude. He's like, you should need, he said pull up your LinkedIn. And I was like, okay. He said pull up my LinkedIn. And he had made 10 posts that day. And I had made one. He was like, okay, pull up Instagram, pull up your Instagram. He had made three. I hadn't even made one that day. And then he said pull up your YouTube, pull up my YouTube. And once we did this two or three times, I was like, I get it, I get it. I just need to do way more. He's like, yeah, dude, like way more. And so we as humans often think I need to do twice as much. I need to do three times as much. We can't fathom what it would mean to do a hundred times as much. We're a thousand times as much. But if you want to beat every fucking human being in the arena to the battle of the death, wouldn't you want to leave no doubt? Wouldn't you want to make fucking sure that you were going to win? Because here's the thing. If you see someone ahead of you, a lot of people get triggered by this. They see someone ahead of them. They throw rocks at them and they're like, because it makes them feel bad at themselves. I strongly encourage you not to do that. If someone is doing better than you, they are better than you in some way. And in that, you can learn of them. Real. So when someone's doing better, if you're like, I gotta beat them, you look at their volume, right? And let's say that someone's doing three times this volume that you can see, right? What do you do? Do you do three times the volume? No, because now you're just matching them. You need to do 10 or 20 or 30 times the volume, because not only that, they're doing volume that you can't see. You're just judging on the volume you can see. And so if you want to leave no doubt, it's like not only if I did the same amount of work as that guy, I'm always behind. So I gotta do more work to catch up, but that's just based on what I can see. I might have to do more more to make sure that I accommodate for the things that I can't see. And so I think I would ask yourself the question, if I knew beyond a shout of a doubt that if I could do a hundred times more than I'm currently doing, I would hit the goals that I have. Then I would then ask the question, great, what resources are required? And then following up to that, is it worth it? And if the answer is yes, what's stopping it?
