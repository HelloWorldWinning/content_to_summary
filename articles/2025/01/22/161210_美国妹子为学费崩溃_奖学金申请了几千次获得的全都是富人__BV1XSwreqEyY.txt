 I don't give two shits if people call me better for saying this. Why I'm hitting the blinds in thousands of fucking scholarships! But the only people who are getting the scholarships are the fucking rich people! Don't fucking rich people! Like your parents have money! Your parents are doctors! They're fucking lawyers! They're fucking judges! And you'll get millions of fucking dollars to go to college! Why you have all of these lower income people here looking at us like, what the fuck?! Asking dental students how much debt they're in! How much debt are you in? When I graduate, 450,000! How much debt are you in? Right now, like 210. How much debt are you in? I'd say out of pocket. How much debt are you in? A lot. How much is this problem? Like 300k out of it. I don't know. Like a million? How much debt are you in? Like 700,000. I'm chatting with a new friend in China and their law schools are $798 per year. Which just makes me feel so angry because I have like $450,000 in debt. Just to go to law school. And I'm explaining this extremely fucking bonkers system that we have. And I'm like, this is a slave contract because I'll never be able to pay back these loans for my entire life. Like I, or in my lifetime, I will never pay back my student loans without a loan forgiveness program. And they told me that China has public school for college. That's how much it is. Wrong. $650 American per year. I looked up the average price of one year of college in America. $30,000 is the middle for one year. And we have to go for four years for a degree. I'm moving to China. Are you kidding? No, because fuck you America for making me pay. For making me work for fucking jobs. For making me work for jobs. For making college. And for all the fucking Tennessee that can barely pay my own fucking rent. And I'm taking 19 credit hours on top of those poor fucking jobs. And I still can't graduate all the time. And I still can't graduate early even though I'm taking 21 credit hours next to master. It's not fucking fair. It's not fucking fair anymore. It's never been fair not in my lifetime. And will it ever be fair? No, because I'm a woman in America. Oh my God. I just want to live in peace America. And I will one day. Probably somewhere fucking else. Anyways, look how cute my nails are. After being on red note for a little less than a week now. I have to say I've noticed some huge, huge differences between American social media and Chinese social media. I have to say one of the biggest changes that I've noticed is the fact that the Chinese people don't look just absolutely defeated. Like they don't look like pressure from everything is just crushing them. I've noticed that I don't see any of them starting GoFundMe pages to pay for their medical bills. I've noticed that I don't see any of them talking about the tens of thousands or a hundred thousand dollars in debt that they're in because they wanted to go to college and get an education. Finnish
