Description:
好的，这是对您提供的文章进行的总结，包含核心观点、根本观点、总体框架以及一个使用 Mermaid 语法生成的概念图。

**1. 核心观点 (Core Point):**

孝道的核心是顺从，它牺牲了孩子真实的自我，导致民族性格的虚假和缺乏活力，阻碍了个人发展和文化进步。
(The core of filial piety is obedience, which sacrifices the child's true self, leading to a false national character and a lack of vitality, hindering individual development and cultural progress.)

**2. 根本观点 (Fundamental Point):**

对父母的无条件顺从，源于婴儿期对被抛弃的恐惧，并被文化强化，导致个体无法发展出独立的人格，阻碍了追求真理和正义的意愿。
(Unconditional obedience to parents stems from the fear of abandonment in infancy, and is reinforced by culture, preventing individuals from developing an independent personality and hindering the pursuit of truth and justice.)

**3. 总体框架 (Overarching Framework):**

这篇文章从心理学、文化学和历史的角度，批判了传统孝道文化。它首先分析了“孝”字的演变和含义，指出其核心在于“顺”，即无条件服从长辈的意愿。接着，文章引用了心理学理论，如温尼科特的真假自我概念，以及弗洛伊德的俄狄浦斯情结，说明了孝道文化如何塑造出虚假的自我，导致个体缺乏活力和创造力。最后，文章探讨了孝道在儒家思想和中国文化中的地位，指出它如何压制个人欲望，阻碍了独立思考和对真理的追求。文章还强调了独立人格的重要性，提倡追求真我。

(This article critiques the traditional culture of filial piety from psychological, cultural, and historical perspectives. It first analyzes the evolution and meaning of the word "filial piety", pointing out that its core lies in "obedience", that is, unconditional obedience to the wishes of elders. Then, the article cites psychological theories, such as Winnicott's concept of true and false self, and Freud's Oedipus complex, to explain how the culture of filial piety shapes a false self, leading to a lack of vitality and creativity in individuals. Finally, the article explores the status of filial piety in Confucianism and Chinese culture, pointing out how it suppresses personal desires and hinders independent thinking and the pursuit of truth. The article also emphasizes the importance of independent personality and advocates the pursuit of the true self.)

Why does filial piety make a person's heart heavy and lack lightness and vitality of spiritual energy? Why is it said that the culture of filial piety has eliminated the intellectual soil for the development of justice and rationality in Chinese culture? Why is it still today, no matter how great the law is, it is not as powerful as the opinions of those in power. Today we continue Read the book Giant Infant Kingdom. Today’s reading chapter contains the answers to the above questions. Today we read that filial piety is the counterattack of human nature. The original meaning of filial piety is obedience. If you want to hear more content, you can subscribe to my YouTube channel. After reading this book, I will also share more related books on the topic of detoxifying Chinese culture. Let’s work together to kill the Chinese culture virus in our own minds, and at the individual level, we can make the cultural exodus from Egypt and jump to the state of modern civilization as soon as possible. Let’s get started. Filial piety is the counterattack of human nature. First, the traditional and gentle interpretation of the word filial piety is that the child carries the cruelty of the old man. The other explanation is to chop the child with a knife and bury the child in the ground. However, the word filial piety is actually a bit empty. What is really fatal is the word "shun", which means that the child follows the elder's wishes. The cost of doing so is that the child's true self is sacrificed. This is contrary to humanistic psychology, existential psychology and even the current individual relationship psychology. According to my limited knowledge, there is no such thing as children obeying their parents in Judeo-Christian culture. Secondly, psychologists who have influenced the world since Freud’s psychoanalysis have a unanimous view that the key to raising children well is When children are still infants, parents, especially mothers, have to follow their children's wishes. The most direct reason why they should follow their children's wishes is that babies and young children do need help. British psychologist Winnicott said that if you want to keep your children alive, the first step is to keep them alive. For vitality, he needs to have a feeling that he can freely use his mother to meet his various needs. Winnicott also said that the child's self built around his own feelings is his true self, which is vivid and fluid, relaxed, focused and naturally rich. On the contrary to creativity, the self constructed by the child centered on the mother's feelings is a false self. The reason why the child constructs a false self is because the child discovers that unless he can keenly capture the mother's feelings and thoughts to satisfy the mother's emotions, the mother will not pay attention. His filial piety is to encourage his children to develop a false self. He is not centered on his own feelings and becomes himself, but centered on the feelings of his parents and becomes the false person expected by his parents. The core of the false self is the fear of loneliness and the fear of death. Many clients who have lost themselves and are always unconsciously catching other people's intentions will say, "Mom, don't ignore me, mom, hug me, mom, look at me " when they listen deeply to their inner fears. The core of this skill is fear. The instinct of following parents also comes from fear. The initial obedience does not come from the fear of being beaten and scolded by the parents, but the fear of being abandoned by the mother. The third obedience to the parents is far inferior to the realm of obedience to the baby. The Tao Te Ching says that if you return to the baby, too many people will find that they have given birth to a child. Later, I became healthier. This is because the adult's heart is often blinded by the world and prejudices and becomes narrow and rigid. On the contrary, the baby's heart is fluid, light and has the ability to telepathize. Fourth, filial piety is the core of Confucianism. Several major representatives of Confucianism, such as Confucius, Mencius, Xunzi and Zhuzi, are all considered widowed. Filial piety in the family was indeed exploited by the rulers. However, the knowledge advocated by these saints first came from their hearts. In my opinion, their knowledge was not to cater to If rulers want to deeply understand filial piety, they must deeply understand the hearts of these saints, must analyze their hearts, and must have a detailed understanding of their relationship with their mothers. Freud's classic psychoanalysis and the post-psychoanalytic school Individual relationship psychology is an excellent tool for understanding these saints and even our own hearts. These psychological theories developed from one living therapy after another believe that our life is a cycle, that is, we adults. The interpersonal relationship model is the reincarnation of the interpersonal relationship model with parents in childhood. The influence of mother-child relationship is the most critical. The core of Freud's theory is the Oedipus complex, which is the boy's complex emotions towards his mother. This is a sharp tool for analyzing the saints. However, in In this country, we must be cautious when using psychoanalysis to analyze saints. I hope that after I have no worries about food and clothing, I will devote 3-5 years to study the lives and knowledge of saints and write a book about the fifth Chinese saints. Our culture restrains personal desires and eunuchs. The saint castrated the sexual desire, but they all have the desire for power. This is the two sides of our civilization. The sixth false self, according to Winnicott, is the core of psychological problems. Filial piety and obedience are to create false self within the scope of the entire nation. The self is our national character, that is, the collective consciousness and collective subconscious of our nation. To survive in this nation, it is best to conform to this national character. Therefore, the officials' speech and behavior are all like a collection of eunuchs and saints, emphasizing both sexual purity and purity. They are not corrupt, but behind the scenes their material desires are rampant, and because they still think these desires are bad, they are also very ugly when their desires are rampant. This eventually shows up on their faces and bodies (Lei Zhengfu), so psychologists on TV are It's very much like a good mother with a pair of big breasts who always plays the image of loving and nurturing her children, but their desires always have to be placed in some place. We don't dare to show sexual desire for fear of being castrated. We don't dare to show material desires for fear of being scorned. Being deprived, Freud said that sexual desire and aggression are the two major driving forces of human beings. Winnicott said that desire is vitality. We pretend to have no desire. We pretend so successfully that we also lack vitality. The seventh filial piety is not just a ruler. The need for the true self also comes from our fear of the true self. The deeper layer is desire and the tension of self-expression, such as material desire, sexual desire and aggression. The deeper layer is the flow of love. We first love and feel that we cannot get love no matter what. The first manifestation is maternal love, and then we are afraid that we are wrapped up with aggressive desires. Filial piety is actually a defense against children who are desperate for love. They have not received any maternal love, but they say that whatever their parents do is love and self-deception. The eighth father is a kind son, a filial son, a benevolent minister. Zhong seems to be a correct statement. In fact, there are many fundamental mistakes hidden. No matter how loving the father is and how wise the monarch is, they cannot replace the independent thinking of the son and the minister. It cannot replace the soul of the son and the minister. Independent thinking is the most basic need of the soul. What is an independent soul? It is important that such a soul can enter the Tao and be qualified to surrender. Surrender is not to someone, such as parents or a monarch, but to the Tao. It is just a saying and a bait to induce you to be filial. After all, you have heard about being kind to your father. Is it a detailed interpretation of Junren? Our most common philosophies of life are all variations of filial piety. For example, under the stick of parents, filial sons are born, loyalty and filial piety are balanced, etc. On the contrary, how many philosophies of life have you heard about fatherly kindness and Junren? Relying on such a pitiful sentence or two to find a balance for the grand filial piety is also true in reality. Chinese parents have always had few useful teachings on how to be parents, while there are countless stupid teachings on how to be filial to parents. Ninth Americans Humanist psychologist Maslow talks about self-realization. Rogers, who is also a humanist, talks about becoming yourself. Existential philosophy talks about existence as choice. Choice is freedom. Translated into the vernacular, the meaning of your life lies in how you choose and what you do according to your choices. Life is free only when the will has made a choice. Winnicott speaks true to himself. Some people will say that we want to build a psychology with Chinese characteristics. Filial piety is the core of this psychology. However, what is truly the most Chinese must also be the most worldly. The most important thing in the world is that no matter how much I build the Confucius Institute, Confucius's influence in the world is not as good as Lao Tzu's five thousand words of the Tao Te Ching. The most popular thing in the world is Wang Yangming, and Wang Yangming said that there is no other way outside my heart. These are all the same thing. My favorite The Israeli philosopher Martin Buber was talking about you and I. Only by being loyal to my heart can I meet you. You are God, you are divinity, and you are the way. Therefore, those who live out their true self must be the most loving. The original meaning of filial piety is to be submissive. Parents cannot be disobedient. Parents cannot be sons. Mencius. I have always been opposed to filial piety and instinctively believe that filial piety and filial piety are the same thing. My understanding has attracted a lot of attacks, and the most common one is filial piety. One defense is that the original meaning of filial piety is filial piety but not obedience. The ancient filial piety does not emphasize that the reason why obedience evolved into filial piety is the misinterpretation of later generations. A very eye-catching statement is that filial piety was caused by the Mongols in the Yuan Dynasty when foreign nations entered China. The dynasty that completely wiped out the Han people emphasized obedience in order to make the Han people become common people. Therefore, this is a tool used by the Mongolians, a foreign nation, to enslave the Han people. This statement cannot be promoted with great fanfare. After all, the Mongolians are now part of the Chinese family. After one of the members heard this saying so many times, I became really curious and started to wonder what the original filial piety was like. What is the original meaning of the word filial piety? The word filial piety talks about symbiotic filial piety. Filial piety is always linked together. Shun is easy to understand. And what exactly does filial piety mean? To be honest, I have not understood the meaning of this word for a long time. I believe that most people like me have not studied the meaning of this word in depth, so people who generally support filial piety Only then can we say that we can be filial without being filial, but we don’t know that the original meaning of the word filial piety is Shun Shuowen ’s interpretation of the word filial piety. But the question is what does inheritance mean? To understand this, we might as well take a look at how the ancients created the word filial piety. In oracle bone inscriptions, filial piety means that the old man is above and the son is below, which means that the son is supporting the old man. Therefore, filial piety The original meaning of the word creation is that children and grandchildren support the elderly, obey and serve their parents and elders. In the official script, the official script simplified the word "old" in seal script and wrote the word " filial piety ". The dagger of the dagger refers to an old man whose beard and hair have turned white and become white. This is a classic pictogram, so the word filial piety has two meanings. The old man and the child coexist together to continue the old man's will. Children inherit and pass on. Since filial piety is what it means, then of course there are three unfilial piety, not having offspring is the biggest. Because without children, there is no way to be filial. Therefore, the so-called filial piety culture is actually to pass on the will of the ancestors. It is just such a thing and nothing more. Many thinkers at home and abroad have discovered that a very important shortcoming of Chinese culture is that it has never developed a part that transcends the secular. That is to say, there is no real faith because what we believe in is that our ancestors are greater than all parents and are better than the truth. It is indeed impossible to develop real faith, so our entire culture is mainly wallowing in the quagmire of secularity. Let’s take a look at the ancient stories about Classic discussions of filial piety. You will find that filial piety at that time already emphasized filial piety, and the degree of emphasis was far greater than in modern times. The following paragraphs of discussion are countless similar discussions that I found casually. To facilitate understanding, I have put the ancient text and the translation together. The first original text is the etiquette of a minister. Don’t show remonstrance. If you don’t listen, you will run away. The son’s affairs. Also give three remonstrances. If you don’t listen, you will cry and follow. The translation of the Book of Rites. As the etiquette of a minister, it is not allowed to give advice in public. It is forbidden to remonstrate repeatedly. And when the monarch still doesn't listen, he can run away from his son's foster parents. If the parents don't listen, he will cry and follow them. Because I hate classical Chinese very much, I can only read the translated text at the end. The second time is when the parents are at fault. It is necessary to remonstrate and remonstrate in a gentle and gentle manner, but when the parents do not listen, use filial piety to impress the parents. When the parents are happy, they will take the opportunity to remonstrate again. Rather than offend the people of the township, party and state, they would rather remonstrate more than make the parents angry. If you are happy and beat you until you bleed, you must not be resentful. You must continue to honor your parents. Third, serve your parents. If you find that your parents have done something wrong, you should tactfully advise them. If your parents do not want to obey, you should still serve them respectfully and do not disobey them. Although he is worried about his parents, he does not resent his parents. The fourth son does not get along well with his parents. He cannot be called a human son. He cannot obey his parents' wishes and cannot be called his parents' son. The fifth parents are alive and do not stay away from home. If they want to leave, There must be a clear place to live when traveling far away. Another argument is that parents must be settled first. The first two of the above five statements come from the Book of Rites, which emphasizes children's unconditional obedience to their parents. The Book of Rites is a summary of the Han etiquette before the Qin and Han Dynasties by Dai Sheng of the Western Han Dynasty, and most of them It is a summary of the dialogue between Confucius and his disciples. It is not ancient enough, but at least it was written by the Han people themselves and has always been respected as a classic. The third and fourth discussions are from the two saints Confucius and Mencius. The fourth discussion is still Shun. It makes me think it has a very deep meaning. If parents are unhappy with their children, the children cannot be called human beings. From this, we can also understand why Chinese-style parents easily threaten to sever ties with their children. In modern society, severing ties is just an emotional separation. But In ancient times, according to the teachings of Mencius, if your parents cut off your relationship with you, you are no longer a human being. This means that if your parents do not recognize you and your social status is deprived of you, you are no longer a human being. This statement by Meng Shengren is shocking. Calling terrible Confucius has a more neutral and gentle expression: benevolent people are also close to each other. It means that a person must be good to others before he can be called a human being. The most important thing is to be good to his parents. The fifth statement is also from Confucius and is well known. I personally think The core of this sentence is an important reason why Chinese people lack the spirit of adventure. There are two translations of this sentence. I tend to have a way to settle down my parents. But the question is what does it mean to settle down if it is material? It's relatively easy to do, and I agree. But if it's a matter of mental and psychological issues, how do you settle down, or even whether you can settle down? Then as long as your parents are unhappy, just stay at home. What's interesting is that my mother often expresses this to me after graduation. After that, my income has been good. Although my spoken English is terrible, I can read and I really want to travel. I went to some places in China and abroad. The first time was not until 2005, and the second time was not until 2014. I got out of hand and went to the Arctic and Antarctic, England and Japan, and also took a trip to France and Argentina. Every time I travel, my mother will express her worries, especially when going to the Antarctic and the Arctic. My mother said that I have a good income and want to travel, but I have been less worried about going abroad. I think your worry about me is a very important reason. I hope you can encourage me to live a more exciting life. My mother's advantage is that she can communicate and be persuaded at the same time. She just said yes. After your good mother encouraged you to have more adventures, she never objected to your parents not traveling far away. I think this sentence is not too much. There is another sentence that can be called a perverted body, hair and skin. Parents dare not harm the beginning of filial piety. This sentence is also what Confucius said. It is the first sentence of the opening chapter of the Classic of Filial Piety, which is regarded as a classic. The next sentence is also shocking. The following sentence is also shocking. Be famous for your actions and be famous for future generations. Show your parents filial piety. The last sentence is also said. You live for your parents, and to become famous is to show off your parents. Show what your parents want. What I want to show is your parents’ face and your parents’ will. That perverted saying is the sage version of the folk saying. Your parents gave you a body, and you owe it to your parents. This sentence is like saying that as a child, your body is not yours. It is your parents. Your parents can do whatever they want with your body, but you cannot. This is what Kohut said about the self-object. Although for To parents, the child is an object and another person, but you are still a part of the parent's self. It seems that our culture's emphasis on filial piety only sanctifies the phenomenon of self-object. We are all giant babies and we all want to find a good one. The mother is her own self-object, but her efforts failed when she was a baby. Instead, after becoming a parent, she has the right and qualification to let her children be her own self-objects. Let me emphasize again that letting children be their parents' self-objects means children. It is a part of the parents themselves. Children must do exactly what their parents want. The parents' wishes are realized through the child's body. When it comes to filial piety, many people will say that it is not natural for children to support their parents. First of all, in mature countries such as Europe and the United States, children do not support their parents. Obligation Secondly, I personally believe that we are indeed not a mature country, so children should support their parents materially. I have never objected to this. If this is filial piety and it must be coupled with children's respect for their parents, then I will 100% support it, but I think Filial piety has not emphasized material good since the time of Confucius and Mencius. Do you think those paragraphs just talked about material support? What they talk about are all spiritual and psychological things. They want children to be spiritually and psychologically filial to their parents. The original meaning of the word filial piety is to talk about the obedience of children to their elders. We will talk about it later. Every life should be independent. This means that everyone is responsible for their own feelings, and these classical accounts of filial piety say that children are responsible for their parents' feelings. They cannot make their parents unhappy. As long as their parents are unhappy, you are unfilial. This makes no sense if the parents themselves cannot be happy. What should I do about foolish filial piety, filial piety and filial piety are the same thing in my opinion? Are n’t these the most authentic classical texts on filial piety talking about foolish filial piety? The flavor of foolish filial piety is fully reflected in the second discussion above from the Book of Rites and In this passage, the truth is not as important as the emotions of the parents. The eldest son must respect the truth, so the parents have tried to remonstrate, but the remonstrances failed, so don’t make trouble and don’t make your parents unhappy. What should you do next? After Confucius said something, the parents refused to comply. Also, respect, don’t disobey your work, and don’t complain. It means that since your parents don’t accept your advice, you should obey them, don’t disobey your parents, and you can’t be unhappy. Many people say that Confucius is against foolish filial piety, so they take a dialogue in the Classic of Filial Piety as an example. The classical Chinese part of the argument cannot be read and only the translation can be read It means that when the father and the monarch are unjust, they need to fight for their sons and ministers to argue with the father or the emperor instead of following the father's orders. He also said in another paragraph that doing so is unfilial because it will trap the father in unrighteousness but not the son. Can a minister who can resist his father resist the monarch and protect justice and truth? The best thing to do is not to obey the advice of his parents but not to obey his will but to respect his work and not complain or to behave like a minister without showing his admonishment and not listening to the three admonitions. You can still run away, but you still have to be unprincipled with your parents after you have done the three things. Then weeping and crying, what the hell is this? Isn't this stupid filial piety? Instinctively, I have always believed that the emphasis on filial piety makes our culture lack respect for justice and truth, because the will of parents is too powerful. After reading these classical discussions This judgment of mine is further strengthened. This is also the characteristic of a baby or a giant baby. What I want is to do whatever I want and everything goes according to me. My will is right. My narcissism is better than the truth. My will is the truth. So it can be said that we are cumbersome but An important function of the modest filial piety culture is to defend the almighty narcissism of the parents of giant infants. Today’s reading sharing is here for now. Today we read Filial piety is the counterattack of human nature. The original intention of filial piety is to be obedient. We look forward to these two topics below. Meet you again in a reading sharing
