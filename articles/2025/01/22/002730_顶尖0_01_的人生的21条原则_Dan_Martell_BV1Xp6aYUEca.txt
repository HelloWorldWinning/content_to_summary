Description:
好的，这是对您提供的内容的总结，包括核心观点、基本观点、框架结构以及概念图：

**1. 核心观点 (Core Point):**

成功人士需要接受被误解，因为他们独特的行为和远见与常人不同，且无需他人改变来成就自己。

**2. 基本观点 (Fundamental Point):**

为了取得成功，我们需要敢于与众不同，追求卓越，并主动提出更高质量的问题，以发现改进的途径。

**3. 框架结构 (Overarching Framework):**

*   **原则一：接受被误解**
    *   他人不理解是正常的，特别是身边的人。
    *   成功往往需要坚持独特的道路，即使不被理解。
    *   不需要为了让别人理解而改变自己，要接受并坚持自己的独特性。
    *   “怪异”是通往卓越的途径，因为卓越本身就意味着与众不同。
*   **原则二：提出更好的问题**
    *   通过提出“如果有人接手你的业务，他们会做出什么改变？”这样的问题，能揭示潜在的改进之处。
    *   提出高质量的问题能够帮助我们快速发现问题并寻找解决方案。
    *   问题驱动进步，能促进个人和业务的成长。

 I'm going to share with you the 21 principles of success. These principles are what make the top point 0 1% of people successful. Some of these principles are what I've used to make my first million dollars at 27 years old. And others are from what I've observed rubbing shoulders with some of the richest people you know. Now, I do attribute a lot of success in life to luck or grace of God and timing, but there are principles you can implement every day to fast track this luck and attract wealth into your life. So without further explaining it, these are the principles of success. The first principle is to be misunderstood. The other day I was talking to one of my clients and he said, my wife doesn't support my growth. And he got frustrated that every time he do something to try to grow, his wife said something. He felt like she didn't support his growth. And my feedback was very simple. The people closest to you are sometimes too close to see your own greatness. And the reason why is because they know you the best and they've seen you try and fail and say you're going to do something and don't follow through. They're literally the people that have seen you at your worst. And now you're trying to grow and expand and you're upset that they don't support your growth. Jeff Bezos said it best. If you want to be successful, you have to go long periods of time being misunderstood. And the reason why is because if you know something very few people know and you're trying to demonstrate progress and success, you'll go a long period of time not being successful, not showing that you know how to do that. And expecting other people to see what you see inside your mind is not going to work. So here's my big philosophy. This is what I explained to my client. No one needs to change for you to win. Nobody should be easier. It would feel better. It wouldn't feel so lonely sometimes, but nobody else has to do anything for me to win. That is my philosophy, my invitation to you. So don't expect them to understand. And the other thing is like not being understood, that's weird. Guess what's weird? Rich. People that are weird are actually richer. Why? Because they're doing things that other people would never do. That's why they're weird. They're the people that wear the same clothes every day. They're the people that drive around and do the things they want to do. They don't mind being clear about what they want. Some people are like, man, you're too much. And if I'm too much, go find less. And people don't understand this, but to have a life that other people want, it means you have to be extraordinary. It means you have to be extra. And being extra will mean you're going to be misunderstood. So you knew you because it's what you've always loved about every celebrity out there. The people you admire, what you love about them is they are authentically them. This is who they are. This is how they want to live. And because they've allowed themselves to do that, you admire them. Why don't you take a cue from how they're living and go be that person? Which brings us to our second principle, which is to ask better questions. Anytime I'm coaching a business owner or CEO, I always like to ask this one question. If somebody bought your business tomorrow that knew your industry, what's the first thing they would change? Most people can immediately go to that. They're like, well, they probably do this, this, and this. My follow up is, why haven't you made that decision yet? See, most people...
