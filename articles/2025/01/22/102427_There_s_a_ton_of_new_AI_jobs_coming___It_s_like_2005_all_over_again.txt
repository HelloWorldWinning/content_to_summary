hey everybody so I've been trying to figure out what to talk about and uh I was just trolling through trolling through Reddit and Twitter and I saw some posts um that really kind of triggered a Cascade of of thoughts and what I wanted to do today was actually tell you the story of the beginning of my career uh in information technology and how that ultimately led to uh virtualization automation engineering and then eventually to my Pivot to AI but rather than just tell you this pardon me rather than just tell you the story um there's a point and the the primary point is that we are about to see a huge shortage of prompt engineering and AI related jobs so I've been talking with more and more uh industry insiders from various places um whether they're Consulting for government agencies uh other corporations startup folks uh all kinds of stuff so if you're my age is you know Millennial um a little bit older a little bit younger you might remember in the late 90s and early 2000s all of the advertisements about how there was just such a huge shortage of it people and if you go get some Microsoft certifications you're basically guaranteed a job now back in the you know early a mids that was actually pretty much true I remember my mom's boyfriend at the time he got out of the Army and went and got a couple of Microsoft certifications and immediately had a $50 to $70, 000 job which in the late 90s is pretty good um and then I did the same thing a few years later um I started in like 2006 2007 um and back then the job market in technology was very very different it was basically like you get a toe hold in the door and then it's there was just like they didn't even know what to call the jobs like now you'd have a job like you know okay it server you know engineer or desktop support literally every low-level it job was just called it analyst and they didn't even know how to define the damn things like that's how chaotic it was because it was just not like nailed down it was not well defined or clearly defined and so like HR people didn't know how to describe the jobs and you know hiring managers are like we just need some young guy who knows computers and can fix stuff and that was me that's how I got my career started so what I'm predicting is that we're about to see a similar kind of growth over the next two to five years of basically just anyone who can talk to AI um so that means like all you young people out there um that you just naturally are good at chat GPT and Claude if you're watching this and not even necessarily if you're young um particularly if you do have some other uh subject matter expertise or computer expertise and you can combine that with artificial intelligence but let me tell you a little bit more about how the job market was very different in the in the the late a and early 2010s uh basically I had because I was and I was very very like low level at the beginning beginning of my career um I was paid $35, 000 a year which is like not even enough to live on today um but I was sent to all kinds of training and so what happens is uh looking back when you have a huge demand you know out in the job market but then you don't have the supply the labor Supply to really meet that demand companies realize okay we can't hire like there's nobody out there to hire to do this job so we have to get someone who's good enough and then train them now I predict that that's what we're really going to see we're already seeing it at the higher levels so for instance you know Netflix and other companies are shelling out uh a million dollar salaries or $800, 000 salaries for AI product owners or um you know AI directors of product but that's going to trickle down over time and so what I mean by like trickle down I don't mean like trickle down economics but what I mean is you know a director who gets who understands AI is going to realize that none of his employees understand Ai and actually last year I was contacted by quite a few people to like come do like um like on-site training I ultimately didn't do it cuz I I didn't I was too tired and I didn't want to travel um but that's why I make these videos is because I don't have to travel and I can reach hundreds of thousands of people so yeah okay you might say like all right you know maybe maybe not because I know a lot of you out there are still predicting that like AI is going to quickly give way to AGI and then you know AGI ASI and nobody's going to have any jobs and I do still think that that's going to happen but talking to Industry insiders it's like they're look at like 5 years or more until like it's really Prime Time and of course you know you might say like okay well 5 years from now we're going to have AGI and Robotics and nobody's going to have any jobs anyways that's entirely possible I'm not going to say that that's outside the realm of possibility um just because this is such a uh such a a like a shift a paradigm shift in how we approach work and labor and economics and everything but in the meantime from now until five years from now or 2030 or you know whenever it it is that we hit that huge transition there's probably going to be even more jobs posted for prompt engineering um or even jobs that use chatbots or or that kind of thing um and then of course all the ancillary skills around it such as like API integration um AB testing prompts and all sorts of stuff building agent Frameworks all kinds of things I remember one of the conversations that I had with someone um at a local company when I very very like very beginning of my career when I was literally just plugging in computers I was a computer desktop installer at the very beginning of my career and I was I was uh upgrading the computer for a guy who was an eight uh web framework developer so web Frameworks are all like off the shelf and like nobody develops that anymore but back then companies had to develop their own in-house Frameworks um and so like we you have this this credential inflation and things just kind of get easier and so like Lang chain and agent Frameworks and all the stuff that you have to build manually right now within a few years those are going to be just like off-the-shelf kinds of products but what I'm what I want to tell you is that all of you people out there right now working on building you know uh workflows Lang chain kind of stuff agent Frameworks those sorts of things you're doing everything the hard way right now which I mean if you were installing computers in the 90s or early 2000s like Windows XP installs were so fragile and required so much handholding but now installing operating systems is super easy likewise um you know building agent Frameworks and building agent models right now very difficult but within the next year or two it's going to get much easier but everything that you're learning right now like at the very low level in terms of what works what doesn't you know everything behind the scenes yeah like in a in a year or two you're going to be like ah kids these days you know I had to do all this stuff manually now it's all you know we have model Arbitrage and you know model agnostic design and blah blah blah all this but you're still going to benefit from knowing what's going on under the hood um and that will really set you apart when you're looking for you know whether you're interviewing um at a Enterprise company or talking to Startup Founders um or anything in between or even try trying to pitch to a venture capitalist if you are a startup founder getting in at the ground level and here's another thing that I tell a lot of people cuz like particularly U young people whether uh many of you in my audience or whatever if you're in uh college or High School you say like oh like I'm just afraid that the skills that I'm learning are just going to be useless and it's like but that's been true forever like you talk to most people in professional spaces they haven't used what they learned in college for years sometimes decades so to put this into context I learned Pascal and C++ back in high school I haven't used either of them and well I mean I haven't used Pascal since high school to put that into perspective but the last time I used C Plus+ was when I was experimenting with neural networks back in 2009 that was 15 years ago so the it's not it's not that the skills that you learn are like it's it's it's not the skills that are valuable it's the ability to learn and building the mental Frameworks of technology and science and programming and math and those sorts of things because then going from C++ to python it's like oh wow I can really appreciate how much python is doing for me in the background I don't have to compile anything it has you know like it does all the memory management like there's so much that python does for you that you don't have to worry about that you would have had to worry about with Pascal or C++ likewise you know Lang chain version three and agent you know Forge version 8 and autogen version 12 whatever whatever is coming down the pipeline are going to make everything that you're struggling with right now much easier but you will have done yourself a huge favor by getting in at the ground level so like that's that's kind of a big chunk of what I wanted to talk about but then another part was just like that going back to that Gap like the demand for AI literate people at all levels of organization this is not just individual contributors but the demand for AI literate people at all levels of organizations is about to Skyrocket I'm predicting within a within a year or two if not sooner you're going to see more and more people that are like uh and people I mean like companies hiring four jobs like hey we need a supervisor who you know supervisor of a new generative AI team we need a mid-level manager of a new you know generative AI product team we need a new you know uh senior engineer or Junior developer who is familiar with you know generative Ai and cyber security or devops or whatever like there are going to be so many jobs and this is just inside of the like the tech bubble right the It software development you know that that branch of companies but even more so what I'm hearing out there in talking to insiders is that mid and level leadership are basically the the the more the more uh let's say experienced and the ones with more wherewithal are realizing that AI is advancing faster than than the old fuddy duddies can keep up with and they're saying you need to hire someone in their 20s who eats sleeps and breathes this stuff um and you need to talk to them so like you're going to you're going to see more AI advisers kind of roles where it's like hey you might be a dork an engineer you know someone who is going to be tinkering with all the latest stuff um but there's 's going to be a place for you even if you're not necessarily super experienced on the business side what I will say is that the ability to communicate this is something that I have been saying uh I've been beating this drum for a while but I'm also hearing more and more people say this is that the ability to communicate um whether that is participating in meetings um negotiation presentation skills super important being able to talk to Executives being able to talk to managers on their terms being able to talk to business people on their terms those are all going to be extremely valuable skills particularly when paired with AI literacy and AI competence skills um and there's different levels because there are there's when I say like AI literacy and AI competence like at the very like low level and I don't mean low level like low rank but I mean like people that can build neural networks um I've worked with some of those kinds of people um as well like if you know the math if you can if you can build you know a tensorflow Model A Caris model um great like that is still super useful um if you can deploy those in you know full stack you know Hardware Soup To Nuts um kind of kind of uh deployment model or or job rooll great but then also at the higher level and so I guess by higher level I mean higher level of abstraction because I'm thinking in terms of like C++ is a lowlevel you know there's like assembly C++ python but a higher level abstraction prompt engineering and understanding the epistemic uh model of how uh AI Works cuz it's really weird and what I mean by like epistemics of of AI is if you talk to a philosopher about what an AI is doing they're going to give you one answer they're going to say oh well it's just pretending to know things I'm like okay well what's the difference between pretending to know and actually knowing if it's objectively measurably the same but again philosopher perspective you ask a mathematician what the model is doing and they're say it's just calculating Matrix math okay sure but that's like asking a chemist what the human brain is doing so anyways you ask different people what these things are doing at different levels and that multidisciplinary understanding of what models are doing also is going to be hugely important because you know the the business folks the finance folks they're just going to care how much does it cost what is the ROI is it worth deploying um so if you can talk about like you know quantization strategies or distillation strategies or can we get by using 150 billion parameter model or a 4 trillion parameter model or a 6 billion parameter model like if you understand those optimization uh like the math going behind it whether you know what kind of software container it needs to run on what kind of Hardware container it needs to run on its impact to the business there's all kinds of ways to look at what is coming down the pipeline and there are like at the highest echelons of some of the top you know Fortune 500 companies they are having these conversations behind closed doors they're not talking about it publicly yet um but you know at conferences or private um private consultations they are saying hey we know that this is coming down the pipeline how do we prepare for it and who do we need what do they need to know those sorts of questions are being asked behind closed doors and so with that with all that in mind I'm here to tell you that keep investing in AI skills but also just as important as that equal so like AI competence and literacy and you know low-level uh building models or more higher level of abstraction of prompt engineering and knowing how those things fit into businesses um but then also the people skills um whether it is negotiation presentation skills shooing I know a lot of you out there particularly a younger version of me was would have been like you know shmooing small talk I don't care about that um but you know what we're all humans and human that's how the human operating system works and it's just another skill right so you you know computer programming is a skill you know video gaming is a skill uh just treat communication as another skill set another skill tree that you can invest points in you'll be fine um those are the going to be the things that really set you apart and so there's a few things like just personally why I'm making this video and why I want more of you out there is because I do see that the friction is coming deployment is going to be difficult even if you have AGI that's super intelligent yes there's going to be some dropin technologies and what I mean by a dropin technology is where you just replace a human wholesale with a new robot or something it's probably going to be a while before that's possible 5 to 10 years before it's like wholesale just get all humans out of the out of the loop and I do believe that that's coming but like a lot of you I want to get there sooner rather than later I don't want to get any older I want to start solving problems I want to cure aging and cancer and you know get to nuclear fusion and AGI and everything else that's coming but there's a lot of barriers to get from there to here or from here to there rather and so in the meantime I want as many of you to get AI jobs as possible um so with with all that being said I am launching a community which will help you on this path links will be in the description um and the uh put it this way uh stay tuned uh July 27th depending on when you're watching this is when we're going to have a pre-launch and then August 5th I believe is going to be the public launch so stay tuned mark your calendars for August 5th and we will make sure to get you in to my brand new community the new era Pathfinders because we do have to uh find our way through this new era of AI and all the other fourth Industrial Revolution technologies that are coming so thanks for watching have a good one cheers
