all right so deep seek R1 just came out and it looks like it has pretty much entirely caught up to uh open ai's o1 at least so kind of one of the mantras that we've been saying uh out on the Internet is there is no moat so what do I mean when I say there is no moat and what does that mean for us so no moat in artificial intelligence basically means that there is no barrier of Entry or there is very little barrier of Entry so for instance intellectual property or IP law does doesn't really seem to be slowing any other companies down Microsoft Google meta anthropic uh deep seek all these other companies sorry I got something in my eye all these other companies um are catching up uh to open Ai and that means that there is no real Secret Sauce there's no barrier to replication of what it is that they're working on uh there's also there are capital requirements so for instance it does take money it does take data centers and compute but as we've been seeing with the Chinese companies is they're often duplicating uh what open aai and others are doing and they're doing it much more cheaply and part of the reason is just because they don't have the resources that we have uh and by we I mean Americans um they don't have as many data centers they don't have as much compute and so that is actually forcing them to actually be even more clever and even more creative we actually have a historical precedent for this the Soviet Union often had to duplicate uh what America was doing on a shoestring budget which forced them to be even more clever now ultimately it still didn't help because they just did not have the capacity to keep up with us uh I think the same will be true of China but anyways my point is is that the capital requirements um are not necessarily a uh an insurmountable barrier considering how many startups are getting funded we haven't even seen anything come out of Ila's uh SSI Inc but he got a billion dollars of funding or something like that um and then the technical knowhow um you might sometimes think like oh well it's you know only only you know 10 people in the world know how this works has demonstr been proven false we have people around the world and across many companies even here in America and and Europe that clearly have the technical knowhow to advance this down the field um and so yeah you end up with uh basically the long story short is there's no barrier of Entry there's a little bit of friction but there's nothing intrinsically keeping it from going also if you hear my dogs trotting around we got two new dogs so I apologize there's nothing I can do about that okay now with that being said you might say okay well Dave if there is no moat then why is open AI still out in the lead and that is because of first mover's Advantage so first mover's Advantage basically is they're the first out of the gate chat GPT was the first shot around the her around the world back at the end of 2022 here we are a full two years later three no two years later what is time um because we had 2023 that was like the year that everything took off then 2024 was last year okay so we're just over two years after that in initial shot and even just two years after that initial shot a lot of people have caught up so that's why open AI is experiencing a diminishing lead so initially their lead was 12 to 24 months but now it's down to 1 to two months before um other shops replicate whatever it is that they have achieved uh we have seen this with Google which is about to release their reasoning model and so on and so forth and of course the Chinese deep seek now one thing that I will say is a big huge caveat a giant asterisk around anything that the Chinese do it's entirely likely that what they have done is literally just stolen um this is one of the primary concerns that I've heard echoed again and again which is that the Chinese just exfiltrate all the data and the research um why do it yourself when you can just steal it from someone else um now however that being said is that this lead has allowed open AI to maintain commercial dominance just because they were there and they were doing stuff for years before anyone else was so just by virtue of the fact that people got used to open AI means that open AI is still uh the market leader even if other companies are taking up or P catching up and overtaking them sorry um catching up and overtaking them in terms of cost quality those sorts of things now there's it's still hotly debated like which model is best a lot of it honestly you know when people argue about which model is best honestly seems to come down to personal preference and taste which is really interesting um the fact that there is room for for for nuance where it's like it's not just one model to rule them all it's I like this model because it's better for this or I like this other product CU it's better for that that actually shows a huge amount of Market opportunity for diversification which is great it's just like there's not just one car like you can have a car you can have a hatchback you can have a pickup truck you can have a van right there's all kinds of form factors that are ideal which means that there's plenty of room for Market diversification also I apologize it's really dry the winter is making me itchy I apologize for all the interruptions I'm getting back I'm used to this um anyways so the you the existing user base of open AI means that there's lots of people that are just going to keep using it just because it's what they're used to it's they say this is what I got used to this is what I grew up with I'm going to keep using this um so the market dynamics though mean that even though open AI has first mover Advantage it's not going to last forever um now the other thing is open source and Market company competition so one of the longer term impacts of the fact that there is no barrier of Entry means that you know you might be able to use models completely fungally and so a fungible model means that you can use them interchangeably you can use an open source model you can use llama you can use deep seek you can use Claude you can use open AI from a business perspective you don't care you just want it to work if it's completely free and open source great if you have to pay another service provider great you really don't care so in the long run this is really really really bad for open Ai and the reason is because they are they're what I call a one- trick pony open AI offers literally one product they offer one product one service they have zero diversification which means that if some other company or even an open source model comes along and eats their lunch every company out there that's paying open AI right now they're going to make the rational Choice like well this other Chinese company can do the same thing but it's 50 times cheaper and five times faster or maybe even this open source model can do exactly what I need and it's completely free now what I will say is that open AI still has that first movers Advantage but that's literally their only moat is this is the Cadence at which they have released that's their only moat um so then you end up with this this process of uh what's called Market democratization which means that there is no possibility for Monopoly uh the data is out there the data is basically free the research is basically free which means the waterers warm come up in anyone can join this and that means that again no moat um this is really really good so there's two reasons that this is good for everyone so number one is price Dynamics hey dogs number one is price Dynamics competition drives down price this is basically going to be like trying to do price control on nuts and bolts and I mean like the literal like metal things because literally anyone can make nuts and bolts you just need the right equipment likewise in you know already today anyone can host models you just need the right equipment it's not a big deal it's going to be commoditized very very soon and it's just going to be ubiquitous it's going to be everywhere um this is good for uh consumers because it means that prices will be down and access will be uh will be ubiquitous and also um if someone tries to jack up the price guess what you're just going to go to someone else because you just swap out models you just say you know what you're too expensive I'm going to go over here um so it's a very very Cutthroat Market which is good for us and it's also good for Innovation because that means in order to differentiate your product on the market you need to do something better you either need to be cheaper you need to be faster you need to be smarter and if you're not all if you're not ideally you're all three of those but if you're not at least one or two of those why is anyone going to use your product right like it's it's just that simple now um what I want to talk about because I always do this is I want to I want to uh tie this back to historical examples because while history doesn't exactly copy itself it always Rhymes so first and foremost um I compare this to three prime uh three uh previous technology sorry the printing press radio and internet in all three of these cases the printing press once Johannes Gutenberg invented it it started spreading very quickly uh within a decade it had jumped borders and within a hundred years it was literally all over Europe uh and America and starting to spread other places now what's really interesting is the is the printing press was actually banned in places like the Ottoman Empire for three centuries there's a reason that the Ottoman Empire no longer exists put it that way so any and the lesson there is that any Nation or company that resists these technologies will cease to exist eventually because eventually you get so far behind that it's like the inverse of the first mover's Advantage it's like if you get too far behind on this you lose and when I say you lose you lose forever you cease to exist so that was the printing press radio again once once the radio was figured out it was too Democratic you can't put the genie back in the bottle there and likewise the internet itself is literally designed to be used by everyone um and so the printing press the the historical impacts of the printing press are very difficult to overstate because everything from the enlightenment which led to democracy um and and the fall of uh of the hegemony of the church all of that can be traced back to the printing press um because and the reason that is is because it dramatically raised literacy rates and it dramatically democratized the marketplace of ideas the internet has taken that to its maximal conclusion where everyone can share every idea which includes you know flat earthers and antivaxers and Q andon and all that fun stuff everyone has an opinion and everyone can share their opinion and whatever opinions most resonate with you you can adopt those opinions whether or not they are supported by empirical evidence so we have reached maximal Dem demra democracy of information with the internet so that and the the radio also helped with that because radio is instant broadcast um and longdistance communication so the reason that I cluster these three together is because they are fundamentally information Technologies the printing press was the first form of of really mass-produced Information Technology followed by radio well which led to newspapers then radio and then internet so these are basically three generations and now we have the fourth generation information technology which is you can compress literally all human knowledge into a single model and it's not hey be nice sorry we just had the dogs like we've had them for a week and so they're still getting used to each other they're very sweet but sometimes they have miscommunications go on be nice um anyways so the fourth generation of Information Technology is artificial intelligence which it's not just a repository of knowledge and facts it is also a cognitive engine it it is also a problem solver um and yeah so it's really difficult to oversell the magnitude of this new technology because it's not just the book it's the book that is interactive um and that's a really oversimplified way of characterizing artificial intelligence but anyways all right now taking a bigger step back what are the global impacts of this Democratic uh access to artificial intelligence number one is that uh Every Nation will have access when you look at the fact that you can start running some of these models on MacBooks even the poorest Nations on the planet can afford a Macbook which means that literally every nation on the planet can afford to run artificial intelligence now you might say okay well is that good or bad because you don't necessarily want you know some chaotic Rogue actor like North Korea to have access to AGI which I would tend to agree um and we'll get to that uh but on the other hand this will reduce conflict because it uh basically when there is no gradient when there is no Tech Tech olical gradient there's not really any advantage now when I I need to have a gigantic caveat to that because again um in this world the number of data centers you have is basically that's your that's your military base that's your economic base and the United States has literally exactly 12 times the number of data centers as China so in this geopolitical competition America has already won um that that's just side unseen cuz even if China releases a better model guess what we can run more of them um and and and yeah so that that's that's a done deal but in the in the the longer term The Long View of humanity the fact that this technology is intrinsically Democratic oh and by the way it actually benefits more from cooperation the more you share your data the better the AI gets and so this this creates a really interesting attractor state or or Nash equilibrium where the Nash equilibrium is everyone pulls their resources it is it is in it it's like I'm not going to say socialist but it's very very uh it's very collectivist in terms of what this technology affords us because the more data it has the smarter it gets the more you share uh computational resources the smarter it gets now that's not saying that the maximally you know thing is just everything should be open source and free forever because there is still some some uh competition but I am not joking when I say in the long run I suspect that artificial intelligence will be the UN in force that creates um a a unified Global Humanity now I'm not saying like a One World Government that's going to control everyone forever I do think eventually it would make sense to have a a um a layer above Federal governments where you have you know a global government but I I think it should be again Federal where it's basically all the nation states are treated like States in here in America where there's some level of autonomy um anyways yeah it's it's really really difficult to O to oversell the long-term geopolitical social and technological impact of the fact that artificial intelligence seems to be intrinsically Democratic that is just how the math has played out um it no monopolies and that and the fact that there are no monopolies applies also to Nations as well as companies so we're heading towards what I call cognitive hyper abundance um all right so let me just put it into perspective right now there are a global the global estimates are about 15 to 20 million doctorates so that's phds MDS edds you know you know if if you're if your if you're uh if your title ends with doctorate you know PhD that's you know Doctorate of physics um or do sorry do Doctorate of philosophy um or MD medical doctorate then there are only 15 to 20 million of you in the world um that's not enough like we are we and it takes time to make new human phds so if you want to cure cancer guess what you have to find people that are smart enough to help you cure cancer if you want to get to Mars you you have to find people that are smart enough to help you build rockets and by the way one PhD is not fungible for another PhD if you have a PhD in cell microbiology then that is not going to help you to get to Mars unless you need like biofuels or something um but when we as we develop and deploy these Technologies we're going to turn this up by a factor of a thousand because imagine if you know in basically probably by the end of this year or next year we have the equivalent of 15 to 20 billion phds on the planet and they can do any top like anything like again that's why I keep saying like and I I I'm driving this point home you cannot oversell the long-term scientific and economic impact of what is happening right now um I mean yeah so just cognitive hyper abundance that's what we're heading for let's talk about uh some of the risks though as promised so the risk of this is number one cyber risks these things can already write code um and you can Jailbreak them and they can write malicious code um so basically that means any boor teenager or you know disgruntled federal employee or whoever can write great software viruses um and now what I will say one mitigating Factor though is that just because one disgruntled person has AGI in their pocket or super intelligence in their pocket so does every it department so does every firewall eventually so I'm not as worried about cyber risks because there's always an arms race like oh you know you get a faster computer well guess what the Cyber Security Experts also got faster computers you get artificial super intelligence guess what the other the the the red you know the blue team so it's you know red team and blue team the Blue Team also gets the same tools now what I've mentioned before though is that to me the greatest risk is always the bio like biow weapons because you know State actors rational State actors they know like hey I'm not going to um benefit from releasing a bioweapon that kills everyone we already saw that with Co don't do that um that's just nobody nobody wins in that situation um that's a lose lose so that's that's basically the same uh Game Theory as mutually assured destruction um so like nobody launches the first nuke because if you launch a nuke everyone loses um it's kind of like you know someone just like if you get angry and like you just throw the Monopoly board everyone loses likewise rational State actors are probably after the co pandemic probably not going to release bioweapons that doesn't mean that an irrational actor like a terrorist organization or a rogue State like North Korea won't just say ha if I can't win nobody wins you know like um like a Littlefinger from Game of Thrones like chaos is a ladder right Psychopaths think like that so there might be some psychopath out there that says you know what I'm going to use this technology to make a bioweapon just because I think it'll be funny right some people think like that um so those are the biggest risks in my view now some people will say well what about you know upsetting the jobs and blah blah blah blah look if we have cognitive hyper abundance your needs are going to get met that's long story short like you're not going to starve you're not going to go homeless we will figure that out I have that much faith in humanity now uh everyone's role in AI advancement by this point you might be saying well okay there's nothing I can do you don't have to do anything right like I I wanted to I tried to do that for a little while I was like you know what I'm just going to let it play out and and eventually I got bored and I was like you know what I still have a role to play actually it was Julia convinced me that I still had a role to play because I I wrote a tweet and this is Julia McCoy by the way I wrote a tweet saying like I can just kick back and relax and just let it play out because I have no contribution to make and she's like that's not true Dave and I'm like all right you're right um she's she's we call her team mom I call her team mom she's like no that's not true um anyways so what can you do not everyone is going to be doing core research not everyone needs to be working at open AI basically once the thing exists and the thing already exists we have all these AIS out there and there's more and more coming every day um if you can get into core AI research great go do that but that that's only that's only the first piece of the puzzle um education so if you can teach people um you teach friends family co-workers if you can teach a business if you can teach on the internet teach everyone that you can about AI how to use it what is it good for what is it not good for um then you can deploy it if you actually use it in your life or your business share that the more you deploy this stuff the harder you push the faster it will get adopted so it's you know adoption acceleration deployment and integration that's everything also my dog is trying to initiate some wrestling with me I know making videos is boring we should just play with the dogs also if you want to know what to do get dogs um I'm serious because dogs don't care about AI all they care about is like love affection food good walks and quality time together they are so immediate I need to take them for a walk after this um anyways uh so deployment and then best practices so best practices uh basically I kind of make I break best practices down there we go into two overarching categories number one is what is it it good for how do you use it and then number two is how do you not use it what is it not good for what problems can't it solve so you capacity and constraints it's kind of the two C's um so capacity constraint what can you use it for what can you not use it for um I that knowing what something can't do is just as valuable as knowing as what it can do and then finally Network effects so this is where I'll end and basically saying you won't necessarily know the impact that you're having I don't even know the impact that I'm having but every now and then I get someone messaging me saying you know Dave this video that you made a year ago inspired me and now I'm doing all this other stuff or Dave this thing that you published like solved so many problems for me and it generated you know $10 million of Revenue and nobody has given me a commission check for that yet anyways just saying if you want to pay me for any help that I've rendered that would be great um yeah so uh the network effects you often don't see the impact that you're having but that's what it's you know that's how it works so anyways thanks for watching to the end and I'll check you next time bye
