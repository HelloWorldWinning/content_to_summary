Duration: 1:28

Description:
**Summary:**

I. **Core Idea:**
    * The speaker believes that having low expectations is a significant advantage, particularly contrasting this with the high expectations common among Stanford graduates.
    * High expectations lead to low resilience, which the speaker sees as detrimental to success.
    * Resilience is developed through suffering and setbacks.

II. **Development of Resilience:**
    * The speaker experienced setbacks during childhood which contributed to their resilience.
    * The speaker uses "pain and suffering" within their company to foster growth and character.
    * Greatness comes from character which is forged through suffering.

III. **Wish for Stanford Students:**
    * The speaker wishes for Stanford students to experience "doses of pain and suffering" to build resilience and character.

**Core Point:** Low expectations foster resilience, a key ingredient for success, unlike the high expectations often seen in successful graduates.

**Fundamental Point:** Character, not just intelligence, is the source of greatness, and character is built through suffering and overcoming adversity.

**Overarching Framework:** Success is not determined solely by intelligence or pedigree but rather by one's ability to handle setbacks and persevere, which are cultivated through experiences of adversity and the subsequent development of character.

 I think one of my great advantages is that I have very low expectations and I mean that most of the Stanford graduates have very high expectations and you deserve to have expectations because you came from a great school. You were very successful, you're top of your class, obviously you were able to pay for tuition and then you're graduating from one of the finest institutions on the planet. You're surrounded by other kids that are just incredible. You naturally have very high expectations. People with very high expectations have very low resilience and unfortunately resilience matters in success. I don't know how to teach it to you except for I hope suffering happens to you. I was fortunate that I grew up with my parents providing a condition for us to be successful. On the one hand but there were plenty of opportunities for setbacks and suffering and to this day I used the word the phrase pain and suffering inside our company with great glee. You know boy this is going to cause a lot of pain and suffering and I mean that in a happy way because you want to train you want to refine the character of your company. You want greatness out of them and greatness is not intelligence as you know. Greatness comes from character and character isn't is informed out of smart people. It's formed out of people who suffered and so if I could if I could wish upon you I don't know how to do it but you know for all of you Stanford students I wish upon you you know Apple doses of pain and suffering.
