Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Background:**
    *   Numerous studies have compared Autoregressive (AR) models, Box-Jenkins models, and Back Propagation Artificial Neural Networks (BPANN) for financial time-series forecasting.
    *   Some studies have used AR as a benchmark, showing that Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and BPANNs often outperform AR models in forecasting Asian stock markets.
    *   These prior studies often used transformed data instead of level data, and they did not consider GARCH models.

2.  **Problem with Previous Research:**
    *   Prior research failed to account for the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (GARCH) model, crucial for capturing volatility in financial time series.

3. **Current Study's Contribution:**
    * This study compares GARCH models with standard BP models for forecasting four international stock market indices (including two from Asia).
    * Unlike previous research, this study employs GARCH to model volatility.
    * The results showed that GARCH models generally outperform standard BP models in forecasting the four market indices except in one case.

4. **Core Point:** GARCH models generally provide better forecasts than standard BP models for international stock market indices, specifically when compared in the context of capturing high volatility.

5. **Fundamental Point:** Utilizing appropriate models, such as GARCH, that are designed to capture the characteristics of financial time series, like volatility, can lead to improved forecasting accuracy compared to general-purpose models like BPANN.

6. **Overarching Framework:** This content presents a comparative study that critiques the limited modeling approach in previous research and advocates for the use of GARCH for better financial time-series forecasting.

Content:
any researchers have already published huge number of papers comparing Autoregressive (AR) model, a model based on Box-Jenkins methodology, and Back Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BPANN) in financial time-series forecasting. Among them, some compared SVMs and BPs taking AR as a benchmark in forecasting the six major Asian stock markets. They showed that both the SVMs and BPs outperform the traditional models, ARs. They did prediction of transformed data, but not level data. They did not take account of GARCH model, specially developed to model financial time series. Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (GARCH) model is needed to capture high volatility for better forecasts. This article applies GARCH model instead AR or ARMA model to compare with standard BP in forecasting of the four international including two Asian stock markets indices. Our fitted GARCH models give better forecasts than the fitted standard BP models in forecasting of the four international markets indices except one market.
