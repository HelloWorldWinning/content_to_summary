Description:
**Summary:**

1. **Problem:**
    *   The rise of small-scale distributed solar generation (DSG) requires accurate site-adaptive forecasting models.
    *   Traditional methods developing individual models for each DSG are not feasible due to the lack of historical data and the large number of DSGs.

2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Adapt the attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to forecast DSG power output.
    *   The adapted model, named Solar TFT (STFT), is evaluated using 188 real-world operational DSG datasets.
    *   The model's generalizability is tested by forecasting on unseen DSGs without training data.

3.  **Results:**
    *   STFT significantly outperforms the persistence model by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively.
    *   STFT also surpasses a time series-specific LSTM model with accuracy improvements of 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% at the same forecast horizons.
     *   STFT's performance advantage is especially evident during high-variability periods and weather transitions.
    *   STFT is better at handling lagged predictions and minimizing errors compared to reference models in weather transition periods.
4.  **Trade-off:**
    *   STFT has a more complex architecture and higher computational cost than other deep learning models.
    *   The balance between accuracy and computational efficiency must be considered in practical applications.

**Core Point:** The adapted Solar Temporal Fusion Transformer (STFT) model exhibits improved accuracy in multi-step time series forecasting for distributed solar generation (DSG), particularly during high-variability and weather transition periods.

**Fundamental Point:** Self-attention mechanisms, when adapted, prove effective in handling the temporal dependencies in distributed solar generation (DSG) power output, enhancing forecasting generalizability for unseen locations.

**Overarching Framework:** The research employs a data-driven approach, adapting an existing deep-learning model (TFT) for forecasting, to address the challenge of insufficient historical data for numerous distributed solar generation (DSG) sites, emphasizing the trade-offs between model performance and computational cost, and validates the approach against both persistence model and traditional deep learning models.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
