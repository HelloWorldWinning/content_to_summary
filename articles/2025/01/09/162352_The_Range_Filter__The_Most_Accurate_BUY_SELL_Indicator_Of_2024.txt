Description:
Okay, here's a structured summary of the provided content:

**1. Core Ideas:**

*   **Buy/Sell Indicator Enhancement:** The video introduces a strategy that combines a "Range Filter" buy/sell indicator with a "Volumatic Variable Index Dynamic Average" (VVIDA) trend indicator and delta volume analysis to improve signal accuracy and profitability.
*   **Range Filter Explained:** The Range Filter smooths price movements, signaling potential trend changes based on price exceeding a set range, acting like a "noise canceler."  It uses a moving average and multiplier to define significant price movements. The visual is a white line which changes to blue in a bearish trend. It also has high and low target ranges for trailing stops.
*   **VVIDA Trend Confirmation:** The VVIDA indicator is used to confirm the trend identified by the Range Filter. It provides both trend direction and strength through volume data. A green ribbon indicates a bullish trend, while a red ribbon indicates a bearish trend.
*   **Delta Volume Analysis:** Delta volume, the difference between bullish and bearish volume, is used to gauge trend strength. A minimum 20% delta is required for long trades, and a minimum -20% for short trades.
*   **Trading Strategy:** A long position is entered when the Range Filter signals a buy, the VVIDA trend is bullish (green ribbon), and delta volume is over 20%. Short positions are the reverse using a sell signal, a bearish trend (red ribbon), and a delta volume below -20%.

**2. Summary Outline:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   The video discusses improving buy/sell indicators by combining them.
    *   Highlights common issues with false signals.
*   **Range Filter Indicator:**
    *   Found on TradingView, called "Range Filter Buy and Sell".
    *   Acts as a noise filter for price movement.
    *   Signals potential trend change when price moves beyond a range.
    *   Visual elements: white line (bullish), blue line (bearish), high/low target areas, buy/sell labels.
    *   Customizable length and range.
*   **VVIDA Indicator:**
    *   Used to confirm trends, filtering out false signals.
    *   Identifies trend direction and strength using volume data.
    *    Green ribbon signifies a bullish trend; red signifies a bearish trend
*   **Combined Trading Strategy:**
    *   **Long Entry:**
        *   Range Filter buy signal.
        *   VVIDA bullish trend (green ribbon).
        *   Delta volume at least 20%.
    *   **Short Entry:**
        *   Range Filter sell signal.
        *   VVIDA bearish trend (red ribbon).
        *   Delta volume at least -20%.
    *   Stop loss placement based on recent swing points.
    *   Take profit target is 1.5 times the risk.
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Summarizes how the strategy integrates the three components.
    *   Encourages viewers to try the strategy.
    *   Reminder to like and subscribe.

**3. Core Point:**

The core point of the video is to showcase a trading strategy that combines a range filter indicator with a trend indicator and delta volume analysis to significantly improve the accuracy and profitability of buy and sell signals.

**4. Fundamental Point:**

The fundamental point is that by filtering the noise through combining indicators and volume analysis, traders can make better trading decisions, avoiding many false signals that are common with single indicators.

**5. Overarching Framework:**

The overarching framework is a systematic approach to technical analysis that combines multiple indicators with volume analysis to improve the accuracy of trading signals. It highlights the idea that using multiple criteria can filter out false signals for a more robust trading strategy.

and I actually created a discovered and I actually created a video to talk about what exactly this video to talk about what exactly this video to talk about what exactly this indicator is but a simple explanation is indicator is but a simple explanation is indicator is but a simple explanation is this it identifies bullish and bearish this it identifies bullish and bearish this it identifies bullish and bearish Trends in the market but what makes this Trends in the market but what makes this Trends in the market but what makes this indicator even better is that it gives indicator even better is that it gives indicator even better is that it gives you the volume data at each point within you the volume data at each point within you the volume data at each point within a trend helping you to know when to a trend helping you to know when to a trend helping you to know when to trade and when not to trade so this trade and when not to trade so this trade and when not to trade so this indicator not only identifies the trend indicator not only identifies the trend indicator not only identifies the trend Direction but also the strength of the Direction but also the strength of the Direction but also the strength of the trend now here's how to take a long trend now here's how to take a long trend now here's how to take a long position with this strategy condition position with this strategy condition position with this strategy condition number one you want to have a Buy Signal number one you want to have a Buy Signal number one you want to have a Buy Signal printed by the range filter indicator printed by the range filter indicator printed by the range filter indicator once you have it you want to ensure that once you have it you want to ensure that once you have it you want to ensure that the trend of the market is bullish which the trend of the market is bullish which the trend of the market is bullish which means you need this trend ribbon to be means you need this trend ribbon to be means you need this trend ribbon to be colored green like it is right here then colored green like it is right here then colored green like it is right here then lastly to ensure the trend is strong lastly to ensure the trend is strong lastly to ensure the trend is strong enough and increase the chances of the enough and increase the chances of the enough and increase the chances of the price going up we need to take a look price going up we need to take a look price going up we need to take a look down here the Delta volume is supposed down here the Delta volume is supposed down here the Delta volume is supposed to be at least 20% the Delta volume is to be at least 20% the Delta volume is to be at least 20% the Delta volume is actually the difference between the actually the difference between the actually the difference between the volume for all the bullish candles and volume for all the bullish candles and volume for all the bullish candles and the volume for all the bearish candles the volume for all the bearish candles the volume for all the bearish candles within this specific Trend so it within this specific Trend so it within this specific Trend so it basically takes the buy volume value basically takes the buy volume value basically takes the buy volume value minus the sell volume value and minus the sell volume value and minus the sell volume value and expresses it as a percentage having a expresses it as a percentage having a expresses it as a percentage having a minimum of 20% increases the probability minimum of 20% increases the probability minimum of 20% increases the probability of the price going up right here we can of the price going up right here we can of the price going up right here we can see it's well above the 20% limit so we see it's well above the 20% limit so we see it's well above the 20% limit so we take a long position the stop loss is take a long position the stop loss is take a long position the stop loss is going to go under the most recent swing going to go under the most recent swing going to go under the most recent swing low targeting 1. 5 times the risk letting low targeting 1. 5 times the risk letting low targeting 1. 5 times the risk letting the trade the trade the trade run and it was profitable now to show run and it was profitable now to show run and it was profitable now to show you the power of this strategy you can you the power of this strategy you can you the power of this strategy you can see that we had another long position see that we had another long position see that we had another long position just a few candles later we had a Buy just a few candles later we had a Buy just a few candles later we had a Buy Signal the trend of the market was Signal the trend of the market was Signal the trend of the market was bullish and then the Delta volume was bullish and then the Delta volume was bullish and then the Delta volume was above 20% if we were to take this trade you can see it would have been trade you can see it would have been trade you can see it would have been profitable now to take a short position profitable now to take a short position profitable now to take a short position it's basically going to be the opposite it's basically going to be the opposite it's basically going to be the opposite so you want to have a sell signal so you want to have a sell signal so you want to have a sell signal printed within a bearish trend the trend printed within a bearish trend the trend printed within a bearish trend the trend is going to be identified as bearish is going to be identified as bearish is going to be identified as bearish whenever the trend ribbon of the vidi whenever the trend ribbon of the vidi whenever the trend ribbon of the vidi indicator is red and then to confirm the indicator is red and then to confirm the indicator is red and then to confirm the trend is strong enough to push the price trend is strong enough to push the price trend is strong enough to push the price down we need the Delta volume to be at down we need the Delta volume to be at down we need the Delta volume to be at least minus 20% and this number should least minus 20% and this number should least minus 20% and this number should be increasing towards the negative side be increasing towards the negative side be increasing towards the negative side here we can see it's at minus 34 which here we can see it's at minus 34 which here we can see it's at minus 34 which is larger towards the negative side when is larger towards the negative side when is larger towards the negative side when compared to our minimum of minus 20% we compared to our minimum of minus 20% we compared to our minimum of minus 20% we take a short position the stop loss is take a short position the stop loss is take a short position the stop loss is going to go above the most recent swing going to go above the most recent swing going to go above the most recent swing High the take profit is going to be set High the take profit is going to be set High the take profit is going to be set at 1. 5 times the risk looking at
