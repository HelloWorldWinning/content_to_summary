Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   Probabilistic time series forecasting aims to predict future probability distributions based on past time series data.
    *   It's crucial for risk management and decision-making.
    *   State Space Models (SSMs) are a common framework for analyzing temporal patterns in time series.
    *   However, real-world time series data is often irregular and noisy, making it difficult to define an SSM using classical methods.

2.  **Proposed Solution: Deep Non-linear State Space Model (DNLSSM):**
    *   DNLSSM is a new forecasting framework that uses both deep neural networks and statistical methods.
    *   It iteratively estimates states and network parameters to capture complex temporal patterns.
    *   DNLSSM uses the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to calculate marginal likelihoods and update distributions.
    *   A non-linear Joseph form covariance update is used to ensure symmetric and positive definite covariance matrices in the UKF.
    *  This enhancement improves the tolerance of the UKF to errors and enables its integration with deep neural networks.
    *   DNLSSM models non-linear relationships between observed data and underlying dynamic processes.

3.  **Results:**
    *   Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that DNLSSM consistently improves the accuracy of probabilistic forecasts compared to other methods.

**Core Point:** The DNLSSM framework leverages deep neural networks and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) with a Joseph form covariance update to improve probabilistic time series forecasting by effectively modeling non-linear relationships and handling noisy data.

**Fundamental Point:** By combining the strengths of deep learning and statistical methods, DNLSSM offers a robust approach to probabilistic time series forecasting, addressing the challenges posed by real-world complexities.

**Overarching Framework:**
The overarching framework involves using a hybrid approach that integrates deep learning with traditional statistical methods to address the challenges in probabilistic time series forecasting, particularly when dealing with non-linearities and noisy data. This hybrid approach is achieved using Deep Non-Linear State Space Model(DNLSSM) which is a specific method utilizing UKF and deep neural networks for improved time series forecasting

Probabilistic time series forecasting aims at estimating future probabilistic distributions based on given time series observations. It is a widespread challenge in various tasks, such as risk management and decision making. To investigate temporal patterns in time series data and predict subsequent probabilities, the state space model (SSM) provides a general framework. Variants of SSM achieve considerable success in many fields, such as engineering and statistics. However, since underlying processes in real-world scenarios are usually unknown and complicated, actual time series observations are always irregular and noisy. Therefore, it is very difficult to determinate an SSM for classical statistical approaches. In this paper, a general time series forecasting framework, called Deep Non-linear State Space Model (DNLSSM), is proposed to predict the probabilistic distribution based on estimated underlying unknown processes from historical time series data. We fuse deep neural networks and statistical methods to iteratively estimate states and network parameters and thus exploit intricate temporal patterns of time series data. In particular, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is adopted to calculate marginal likelihoods and update distributions recursively for non-linear functions. After that, a non-linear Joseph form covariance update is developed to ensure that calculated covariance matrices in UKF updates are symmetric and positive definitive. Therefore, the authors enhance the tolerance of UKF to round-off errors and manage to combine UKF and deep neural networks. In this manner, the DNLSSM effectively models non-linear correlations between observed time series data and underlying dynamic processes. Experiments in both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the DNLSSM consistently improves the accuracy of probability forecasts compared to the baseline methods.
