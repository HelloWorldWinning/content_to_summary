Description:
**Outline:**

1.  **NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder) Individuals and Sharing Success:**
    *   Sharing successes with NPD individuals does not elicit joy or congratulations.
    *   Instead, it triggers their envy and insecurity.
    *   They perceive your success as a personal attack on their self-perceived superiority.
    *   Your genuine sharing is twisted into a display of ego, making them feel uncomfortable.
2.  **NPD Individuals and Sharing Positive Experiences:**
    *   Sharing genuinely happy events is met with dismissal and mockery.
    *   They may diminish your joy, stating it's "nothing special."
    *   They tend to be unhappy when you're happy, acting as an emotional black hole that absorbs positivity.
3.  **NPD Individuals and Vulnerability through Sharing:**
    *   Sharing personal details reveals vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
    *   These vulnerabilities can be used by NPD individuals to threaten, control, or manipulate you.
    *   Their goal isn't understanding you but rather collecting information for manipulation.
4.  **Consequences of Sharing with NPD Individuals:**
    *   Sharing anything with NPD individuals results in criticism, suppression, and emotional manipulation.
    *   Exposing your true self provides them with more leverage for control.
    *   Therefore, one should never share anything with NPD individuals.

**Core Point:** Sharing with NPD individuals will result in negative outcomes, such as envy, dismissal, exploitation, and control.

**Fundamental Point:** Due to their inherent need to dominate and manipulate, NPD individuals cannot receive genuine sharing with empathy or support, using information to further their control.

**Overarching Framework:** The framework centers around understanding how NPD individuals react negatively to genuine sharing due to their narcissistic traits, leading to emotional harm.
