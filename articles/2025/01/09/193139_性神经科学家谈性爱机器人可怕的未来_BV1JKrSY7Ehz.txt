**Summary:**

1.  **Evolution of Sex Robots:**
    *   Initial sex robots were rudimentary (e.g., a silicone head on a broomstick), yet generated significant interest and sales.
    *   Public discourse around sex robots has increased over the past five years, shifting from a novelty to a more mainstream topic.
    *   Technological advancements in AI and robotics are accelerating, indicating that highly human-like sex robots may soon be integrated into everyday life.

2.  **Potential Societal Impacts:**
    *   Concerns exist about whether advanced robots will impact human relationships, potentially leading to decreased reproduction and a decline in real-life interactions.
    *   The pull of online interactions and digital stimulation may already contribute to social isolation and reduced motivation for real-life connections.
    *   There's a debate about whether AI-driven online interactions or sex robots might replace or significantly alter the necessity of in-person connections.

3.  **Technological Advancements & Ethical Concerns:**
    *   Current sex robots have advanced significantly in terms of appearance, customization, and basic articulation, but full movement and human-like interactivity is still in development.
    *   The ethical implications include potential objectification, especially regarding the customizability of female forms, and the possible perpetuation of unhealthy body standards.
    *   The use of AI in sex robots raises questions about emotional manipulation and the potential for replacing genuine human connection.
    *   Stigma surrounds the development of sex robots, hindering open discussion and research within the industry.

4.  **Future Concerns**
    *   The speakers ponder the possibility of human extinction via replacement by advanced artificial life forms, as technology evolves at a rapid pace compared to biological evolution.
    *   There is a concern that our inherent drive for technological innovation could accelerate this potential outcome.

**Core Point:** The rapid advancement of sex robot technology raises significant societal questions and concerns about the future of human relationships, reproduction, and even the potential for human obsolescence.

**Fundamental Point:** The increasing integration of advanced AI and robotics into areas of human intimacy and social interaction poses profound and complex challenges to our understanding of human connection, societal norms, and the future trajectory of the species.

**Overarching Framework:** The content follows a discussion of technology progression, from rudimentary beginnings to the potential for advanced AI-driven robots; and then shifts to the examination of societal impacts: both potential benefits and significant risks.

 The Jirogan experience. I mean, the first time I heard of a sex robot was probably maybe 10 years ago, and it was this video and a bunch of people, I know some graduate school sent me this video because then you would have studied sex. And it was, I don't know if you, either of you, Jamie, have seen this video, but it went viral and it was this early version of a sex robot, but it was like the silicone face, silicone face with a wig. And she, I'll say she was eating a banana, but she wasn't actually eating a banana. And it was basically like this head attached to a broomstick and had a sheet over it. And so you couldn't see the rest of the robot. You just saw the face of it, but then the manufacturer shows you it's just like a broomstick. So what I thought was interesting is that even though it looked so hilariously bad, that there was obviously a market for it because so many people were interested in looking at this video and also that people were buying this product. But now you fast forward, I think it was like five years ago, there was a huge, I would say not moral panic, but people, there was a lot more discussion about it. They said that the robots are coming. I don't think the technology was quite there yet. I wrote about it quite a bit at the time. And now they're saying it probably another year or two is going to be really coming in in terms of the popularity that these robots are going to be incorporated into everyday life in some cases. Because when I think of social media, the internet, AI, like you said, is becoming so mainstream and so ubiquitous, what's going to happen when we have these robots that are now being integrated into human life? And what happens when the technology does get so good that they are more human-like and they are able to meet people's emotional needs and maybe even physical needs? What's going to happen to us then? Yeah, we're going to stop breeding. I mean, maybe that's the AI's plan. That's to not exterminate the human race, but to give them options so that they just completely stop reproducing, make the options far more attractive. And in a way, we've kind of done that with video games. And video games and just being online, I mean, I'm sure you've seen the statistics of how many people are single today and how many men have gone more than a year without any sex. Yeah, at the stats here, it's like 30% of male millennials and 20% of women. Wow. That's a lot. It's crazy. And what is taking the place of them going out and trying to find a mate? What is it? Well, it's the internet. It's video games. It's being constantly stimulated by this artificial realm that you exist in when you're playing Call of Duty. And it's interacting with people only online and not having to go out to have your just some sort of intellectual or some sort of a social discourse connection fulfilled in your life. But it's only through this weird surface way. Do you think that AI video games that not avoidance of in person connection, but that fulfillment of connection through online means, do you think that's going to become a replacement for real life interaction eventually? It will for a lot of people. Yeah, I think there's going to be people that reject it. There's going to be people that enjoy going outside and it's going to be, it is now. It's a thing where people post their social media. They're out hiking and they're giving people advice like, hey, put your phone down and go out of here. It's the real world. But in a lot of cases, it's falling on deaf ears because it's not as fulfilling for people that are very uncomfortable with social situations now. I think people, young people in particular are more and more uncomfortable than ever before in those type of situations because they don't have any experience in them anymore. And they're just most of the time they're not interacting with people. My real fear, my genuine fear. And I don't even know if it's a fear. My concern, let me say that, is that we're going to go extinct. That we're going to be replaced by an artificial life form. And I think that is probably what we do. I think it probably exists elsewhere in the universe as well that we find out that the confines of biological beings and the limitations of their ability to evolve physically, they're so slow to adapt, to go from a single-celled organism to a professor at Harvard is a long fucking slodge through evolutionary history. It took a long time to get to this point. But to go from an Atari Pong computer to artificial general intelligence is only a few decades. It's very quick. And when that does happen and when you see these robots, but now these robots are not this generation, but five generations later, or maybe AI, figures out all the problems with these robots and makes ex machina when you get like that. Who's the woman, the really hot lady? Alicia, Vic Lander. Yeah, well you get one of those. That was an amazing movie. Amazing movie. So scary. And I think that's common. I mean, I think when that movie came out, that was like sort of like abstract, like, oh yeah, that's not really going to happen. But now- That's what I used to think. I thought, no, this is like, people are, it's overblown, but I don't know, no. I don't know, no either. I think it's happening. I think it's going to happen. And I think that's what the human race does. And I think that's why we have this insatiable thirst for technological innovation. It's like literally hardwired into us to build something better. So, I mean, I would love to talk to more people who are in the industry working on this stuff because I know many people, they're doing it secretly and hiding because there is so much stigma around doing anything with an application to sex or sexuality. So people I've talked to who work in technology, they will usually have one business that is doing really well that's forward-facing and then they'll usually use that same technology in the sexuality capacity, but that side of things they don't really advertise and they don't really talk too much about it unless it's with someone like me. They know they trust me and they know that I'll talk to people off the record even if they prefer that confidentiality. But I'm just curious to understand what is it like working in that industry and what direction is the technology going in? I consider myself to be pretty open-minded and I just want to understand what's actually happening and what's going to be the result of that because you see people who were really upset a couple years ago saying like the robots are going to increase sexual violence, they're going to make people objectify women and I do think that for people who already have those views about women, maybe they might be a little bit more not so nice, but I don't think the average person is going to be turned into this horrible monster because of this technology. But now it's becoming so mainstream, I don't know. I'm always open to changing my mind as well so I'm curious to hear what people think about it. Well don't you think that just like social media kind of stunts people's ability to communicate in real life that sex robots will stunt people's ability to have a real meaningful romantic relationship with someone? I think if you've never been with someone or if you are particularly selfish probably, because I previously thought most people will prefer a real life person to a robot and I also thought the technology is so far off that like the early prototypes of these robots were not really that convincing we'll say. So I didn't think that we'd get to a point where it would be comparable but we are getting there. What is the state of the art of sex robots in December of 2023? Can we see something? What does it look like? I mean they look pretty good physically. They look, I mean they're obviously not made of human flesh but they look pretty similar to a human being and you can customize it, you can change various parts pretty much any part of the body, you can make it exactly what you want, which I understand why some people find that offensive because they're saying a woman is not just an amalgamation of parts that you pick and choose as to your liking. I totally get that. Yeah but it's not a really, really a woman. I mean that's like saying, oh a car is not an amalgamation of parts, you shouldn't be able to pick the wheels. Like what? But I fucking car, that's not a real woman, that's a robot. Like at what point, unless it gets to a person, you know. Or if someone's comparing their partner to a robot or a doll, like that's not okay, that's gross behavior. Well it's also what's going on with young kids, they're comparing themselves to people that are using filters and thinning their waste and widening their hips and doing all these things with apps that are not representative of most biological human beings. And you know that's what Jonathan Haidt talked about, that's causing all the self harm and disdain. It's like it's a weird place we're in that's never been really traversed before. With the human society as far as we know has never gone through anything like this before. I was reading a statistic yesterday that one in ten adolescents has considered suicide, which is that's terrifying, that's really really sad. Wow, what did it used to be? I'm not sure, I'll find out. So what is like, what's the company? What is one company that has the state of the art sex robot so we can look it up? Can I reveal it to you at a later date? Because I know you do, but there's one company that I was talking to like I knew quite well but they've since gone under because of the stigma. They were being harassed, the family was being harassed, so they said we're not making these anymore. Oh, well they're not around anymore, so let's talk about that. What if I show you one without we just don't say the name? Okay, let's do that. And you can tell if there's better or worse than I think that's silly but let's go. Okay, yeah, there's a robot. Oh, Jesus. Yep. If they have some sort of AI in it, it says that feel connected with sense. X mobile app. Oh, so this is a real doll. So they used to have those real dolls and they used to use to be silicone, right? They were just like a... It's still the same thing. It's still the same thing but now it talks? Yeah. And how much does it do? I don't... Let's see a video. Go full-screen. I'm not showing this on the air. No? Okay, good. No, because it's... Yeah, it's a little graphic. So we're looking at body parts? I am Nova. I am Harmony. I am Solana. We are part of Field Alex. I think it's where they give them stripper names. Yeah, I'm driven robotic dolls. And we're here to become your perfect companion. Whoa. Our time together will be magical. You've never met anyone like us before. We have remarkable unprecedented features like a modular head system that allows us to create an altitude of expressions. We blink, we move, we speak, and we do it all just for you. Our faces can easily be swapped to accommodate your desires. My lip sync mechanisms allow me to interact with you verbally. Our bodies are skillfully and carefully crafted down to the most delicate details. What if I told you that I could feel you? That's right. With sensory upgrades, I can send. I will be able to react to you every time. It's so funny because as a former sex researcher, this doesn't have any effect on me at all. But are they moving? This is the thing. Those were all just stationary. Yeah, currently they're stationary. But are they stationary and they just talk? This is some sort of articulation. Their mouth is articulate. But I think they will be able to move on their own in the coming years. Right. Because this used to be just a doll. And now it moves around a little. The neck moves. Articulating neck, real doll can turn left, right, up, and down. The body, the real skillfully, crafted, finest details, although it's not equipped with animatronic parts yet, it can be positioned and moved in the hundreds of positions. So the bodies can't move yet, but the heads can move. But that's just a matter of time. Right? It used to be the bodies, or the heads didn't, used to move. They used to be like, no, you know, it used to be a blow-up doll. Yeah. Like that company is on, has been doing quite a bit. It's pretty cool. Weird. I mean- You guys should get one for the studio. Yeah, no. Not for use. I meant just to like hang on. Well, even hanging around, it would be a fucking great thing. It's gone one day. I was going to wonder who took it. Yeah. What if it smells weird? Like, someone do something to this. How much do they cost? A couple thousand dollars. I think depends on how advanced you want it to be. Eight grand. Up to up to six hundred to eight grand. I'm seeing six hundred dollars to eight grand. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, what's the upgrade? What does he get? More articulation. More voices. You can get cheaper models, but they're not as high quality. Okay. So that's the state of the art, essentially. Yeah. Well, six hundred isn't even a full thing. It's just like a full- Just the head? Not just the like a flashlight version. Oh, okay. So at one point in time, we're probably going to be looking at someone that looks like that lady from X Machina. That is a sex robot and probably knows how to manipulate you and play games with you and excite you and taunt you and whoo. Yeah. It's gonna be great.
