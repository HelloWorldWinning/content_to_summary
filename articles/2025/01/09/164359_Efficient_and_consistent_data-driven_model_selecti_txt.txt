Description:
好的，这是对您提供的内容的总结：

**1. 主要思想概述**

  * 本文研究了一大类因果时间序列模型（包括ARMA、GARCH等）中的模型选择问题。
  * 首先研究了理想惩罚项的渐近行为，该理想惩罚项旨在最小化包含真实模型的有限模型族中的风险。
  * 其次，为获得一致性和有效性，论文提出了惩罚项需满足的条件。
  * 证明了一致模型选择标准在效率方面优于经典的AIC标准。
  * 最后，从贝叶斯方法推导出了BIC准则，并通过保留拉普拉斯近似的所有二阶项，提出了一个数据驱动的准则KC’。
  * Monte-Carlo实验验证了渐近结果，并表明KC’准则在一致性和效率方面均优于AIC和BIC准则。

**2. 详细总结（大纲结构）**
   * **引言**
        * 模型选择是统计和数据科学中的基本任务。
        * 基于惩罚风险最小化的方法更适合时间序列，因为它考虑了数据之间的依赖性。
        * 惩罚项的校准是关键，需根据目标（一致性、效率等）进行调整。
        *  一致性旨在以高概率识别数据生成过程；效率则指模型风险在渐近意义上等价于oracle模型的风险。
        * 本文旨在为仿射因果时间序列提供有效且一致的惩罚数据驱动标准。
  *  **模型选择框架**
        *   考虑参数仿射因果模型的有限族 ℳ。
        *   使用极大似然估计（MLE）和准极大似然估计（QMLE）。
        *  定义了风险函数 R(θ) 和损失函数 ℓ(θ, θ∗)。
        *  引入了惩罚程序，通过添加惩罚项来解决经验风险最小化（ERM）的乐观偏差问题。
        *   理想的惩罚项定义为：pen_id(m) = R(θ̂m) - γ̂n(θ̂m)，目的是使模型选择器能够模拟oracle模型。
   * **QMLE 的渐近行为**
        *  阐述了 QMLE 的记号和主要假设，包括：
             *  A0:关于过程 X 的假设，保证平稳因果解的存在
            *  A1:参数 θ 的可识别性
            *  A2:确保渐近协方差矩阵的逆存在
            *  A3:Hθ 的下界为正
             *  A4:关于Hessian矩阵的条件
             *  A5:确保 QMLE 强一致性和渐近正态性的衰减率
        *   得到了 QMLE 的渐近正态性定理，即使在模型误判的情况下也成立。
  * **有效的模型选择**
       *  对理想惩罚项的期望进行分解，方便计算。
       *   证明了理想惩罚项的期望可以被维度模型 |m| 近似。
       *   提出了一个近似理想惩罚项期望的惩罚项 peñ(m)。
        *   证明了如果惩罚项在概率上渐近趋于零，则该准则不会渐近选择误判模型。
        *   提出条件，以获得接近模型族中最小损失的超额损失。
        *   对惩罚项提出进一步要求，以获得一致的选择准则。
        *   证明了满足这些条件的准则（例如，BIC）满足更严格的效率不等式。
        *  证明了 AIC 准则等具有固定除以 n 的惩罚项的准则，会产生过度拟合且效率较低。
  *  **从贝叶斯模型选择到数据驱动的一致模型选择**
        *   介绍了贝叶斯模型选择，这通常会得出 BIC 准则。
        *   通过拉普拉斯近似，得到了后验概率的渐近展开，推导出BIC准则。
        *   提出了考虑所有二阶项的KC准则和KC’准则。
       *   证明了 BIC、KC 和 KC' 是渐近一致的模型选择准则。
  *   **理想惩罚渐近期望的计算示例**
         *   给出了在几种常见时间序列模型中 Trace((Fm(θ∗m))−1Gm(θ∗m)) 的计算示例。
         *  对于高斯模型，与经典的 AIC 惩罚项相一致。
        *    对于 ARMA 模型，理想惩罚的期望接近 AIC 惩罚项。
       *    对于 GARCH 和 APARCH 模型，理想惩罚的期望与模型维度成比例。
   *   **数值研究**
        * 使用 R 软件，通过 Monte-Carlo 实验验证了理论结果。
       *  比较了三个数据生成过程(AR(2)、ARMA(1,1)和GARCH(1,1))的 AIC、BIC 和 KC’ 标准。
        *   实验结果表明，BIC 和 KC’ 在选择真实模型方面趋于一致；KC’ 的性能优于 BIC。
         *   还表明，BIC 和 KC’ 准则产生的剩余项 𝑀̂𝐸 会随着 n 的增加而减少至 0；AIC 产生的 𝑀̂𝐸 不收敛至 0，从而验证了效率方面的理论结果。
  *   **证明**
        *   给出了所有定理和命题的证明。

**3. 核心结论（一句话）**
   *  本文提出了一个数据驱动的、渐近一致且更有效的模型选择准则 KC' ，该准则在理论和数值上均优于 AIC 和 BIC 准则，适用于因果仿射时间序列模型。

**4. 基本结论（一句话）**
   *  在模型选择中，一致性准则（如BIC和KC'）不仅能渐近地选择正确的模型，还能实现更高的效率，尤其是在真实模型存在于竞争模型集合中的情况下。

**5.  总体框架**

   该研究的总体框架可以概括为：定义因果仿射时间序列模型 -> 引入极大似然估计和准极大似然估计 -> 基于最小化损失函数引入惩罚模型选择 -> 分析理想惩罚的渐近行为 -> 推导数据驱动的、一致且更有效的模型选择准则 -> 通过数值模拟验证理论结果。

Abstract
This paper studies the model selection problem in a large class of causal time series models, which includes both the ARMA or AR(
∞
) processes, as well as the GARCH or ARCH(
∞
), APARCH, ARMA-GARCH and many others processes. We first study the asymptotic behavior of the ideal penalty that minimizes the risk induced by a quasi-likelihood estimation among a finite family of models containing the true model. Then, we provide general conditions on the penalty term for obtaining the consistency and efficiency properties. We notably prove that consistent model selection criteria outperform classical AIC criterion in terms of efficiency. Finally, we derive from a Bayesian approach the usual BIC criterion, and by keeping all the second order terms of the Laplace approximation, a data-driven criterion denoted KC’. Monte-Carlo experiments exhibit the obtained asymptotic results and show that KC’ criterion does better than the AIC and BIC ones in terms of consistency and efficiency.

1Introduction
Model selection is one of the fundamental tasks in Statistics and Data Science. It aims at providing a model (or an algorithm) that is the best, following a criterion, to represent observed data. Two leading model selection procedures have received a lot of attention in the literature. On one hand, the resampling methods such as hold out or more generally 
V
-fold cross-validation are widely used in the machine learning community. On the other hand, the methods based on the minimization of a penalized risk are also now very popular in the community of applied or theoretical statisticians. They are certainly more appropriate to be applied to time series since they take into account the dependence between data. This will be our choice in this paper.
 
The main challenging task when designing a penalized based criterion is the calibration of the penalty. This is mainly dependent on the goal one would like the final criterion achieves. For instance, the objective could be the consistency, the efficiency or the adaptive nature in the minimax sense to name a few.
 
The consistency property aims at identifying the data generating process with high probability. Hence, it requires the assumption whereby there exists a true model in the set of competitive models and the goal is to select this with probability approaches one as the sample size tends to infinity. Although the consistency is a convincing mathematical property, this asymptotic property is not always the most interesting when switching to a practical implementation. Indeed, the true underlying process is generally unknown and trying to identify the true model for any data is quite ambitious. It is often more plausible to assume that the true data generating process is infinite-dimensional, and that one tries to identify a ”good” finite-dimensional model based on the data ([19]). Therefore, it is common in this framework to let the dimension of the competitive models to depend on the number of observations in order to obtain a better approximation and to reduce the prediction’s risk. Hence, the model selection is said to be efficient when its risk is asymptotically equivalent to the risk of the oracle.
 
In this work, we are interested by providing efficient and consistent penalized data-driven criteria for affine causal time series, which are defined by:
 
Class 
𝒜
​

​
(

:
 A process 
X

t

 belongs to

​
𝒞
​
(

 if it satisfies:

​
for any

t

ℤ
.
(1.1)
where 
(
ξ

)
t
∈
T
 is a sequence of zero-mean independent and identically distributed random vectors (i.i.d.r.v) satisfying 
𝔼

<

 with 
r
≥

 and 
M
, 
f
 : 
ℝ
∞
→
ℝ
 are two measurable functions, where 
R
∞
 is the set of numeric sequence with finite number of non-zero terms.
 
For instance,

• if 
M
​
(
(
X

=

=

, then 
(

t

 is an ARCH

 process.
Note that numerous classical time series models such as ARMA(
p

q
), GARCH(
p

q
), ARMA(
p

q
)-GARCH(
p

q
) (see [13] and [27]) or APARCH
(
δ

p
,
q
)
 processes (see [13]) belong to 
𝒜
​
𝒞
​
(
M
,
f
)
.

The study of these causal affine time series more often requires the classical regularity conditions on the functions 
M
 and 
f
 that are not really restrictive and remain valid for many time series.

We will consider the semi-parametric class of models 
𝒜
​
𝒞
​
(
M
θ
,
f
θ
)
 where 
θ
∈
Θ
 (a compact subset of 
ℝ
d
, 
d
∈
ℕ
), where 
(
f
θ
)
θ
∈
Θ
 and 
(
M
θ
)
θ
∈
Θ
 are two families of functions such as for 
θ
∈
Θ
, 
f
θ
:
ℝ
∞
→
ℝ
 and 
M
θ
:
ℝ
∞
→
[
0
,
∞
)
 are known and the distribution of 
ξ
0
 is unknown. A finite family of models 
ℳ
 (for instance, the class of AR(p) processes where 
0
≤
p
≤
p
max
) will be considered, where a model 
m
∈
ℳ
 corresponds to a linear subspace of 
ℝ
d
. A trajectory 
(
X
1
,
⋯
,
X
n
)
 generated from the class 
𝒜
​
𝒞
​
(
M
θ
∗
,
f
θ
∗
)
 with the ”true” model 
m
∗
∈
ℳ
 is supposed to be observed (see Section 2).
 
There already exist several important contributions devoted to the model selection for time series; we refer to the book of [31] and the references therein for an overview on this topic. Also, the time series model selection literature is very extensive and still growing; we refer to the monograph of [33], which provided an excellent summary of existing model selection procedure, including the case of time series models as well as the recent review paper of [12]. The asymptotically efficient selection property has already been tackled in case of linear process type 
A
​
R
​
(
∞
)
 by [37], [36], [22], [21], [20], and recently by [18].
 
The study of a consistent model selection in this class of affine causal processes has been also considered by [4] and [25]. As in these papers, we consider here a risk built from the Gaussian conditional log-Likelihood, which is naturally deduced for all causal affine models 
𝒜
​
𝒞
​
(
M
θ
,
f
θ
)
, and consider a model selection criterion as a penalized Gaussian Quasi-Maximum conditional log-Likelihood (see for instance [16] or [5]). This allows us:

1. To study the asymptotic behavior of an ideal penalty that is defined as providing a minimization of the risk;
2. To determine the conditions for obtaining (or not) the asymptotic consistency of a criterion, i.e. that it allows asymptotically to select the true model;
3. To determine the conditions for approaching (or not) in 
1
/
n
 or even in 
o
​
(
1
/
n
)
 the minimal risk, thus to obtain an asymptotic efficiency;
4. To determine from a Bayesian approach the BIC criterion as well as a second data-driven criterion called KC’, which is obtained by keeping all the second order terms in the Laplace approximation and to prove that they verify the properties of asymptotic consistency and efficiency in 
o
​
(
1
/
n
)
.
In the end, we show that in the chosen framework the BIC and KC’ criteria offer all the advantages with respect to the classical AIC criterion, which allows neither the asymptotic consistency nor the same efficiency. Numerical simulations confirm these results and also show that the new data-driven KC’ criterion clearly outperforms the BIC criterion both in terms of consistency and efficiency.
 
The paper is organized as follows. The model selection framework based on Gaussian Likelihood risk is described in Section 2. In Section 3, the precise assumptions are stated and they lead to new asymptotic results satisfied by the Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimator. The asymptotic behavior of the ideal penalty is studied in Section 4 as well as some conditions for obtaining the asymptotic efficiency or consistency of a criterion. In Section 5, the usual BIC criterion as well as the data-driven criterion KC’ are studied. Finally, examples are detailed in Section 6, numerical results are presented in Section 7 and Section 8 contains the proofs.

2Model selection framework
2.1Finite family 
ℳ
 of parametric affine causal models
Assume a trajectory 
(
X
1
,
…
,
X
n
)
 is observed from a causal stationary solution of (1.1) where 
M
 and 
f
 are two known functions depending on an unknown finite dimensional vector of parameters 
θ
∗
.
 
Now consider a finite family 
ℳ
 of models belonging to parametric affine causal models. In Proposition 1 of [4], due to the linearity of such models and because 
ℳ
 is a finite family, it was established that it is always possible to find a dimension 
d
∈
ℕ
∗
 and a unique couple of known functions 
(
M
θ
,
f
θ
)
 with 
θ
∈
ℝ
d
 such as in such a way that any model 
m
∈
ℳ
 belongs to the class 
𝒜
​
𝒞
​
(
M
θ
,
f
θ
)
. More precisely, there is a one-to-one correspondence between each model 
m
∈
ℳ
 and a linear subspace 
Θ
m
⊂
ℝ
d
 and 
dim
(
Θ
m
)
=
|
m
|
 the number of unknown parameters of the model 
m
. As a consequence, if we denote 
m
∗
 the ”true” model corresponding to 
𝒜
​
𝒞
​
(
M
θ
∗
,
f
θ
∗
)
, we will say:

• if 
m
∈
ℳ
 is such that 
Θ
m
∗
⊂
Θ
m
 and 
Θ
m
∗
≠
Θ
m
 (also denoted 
m
∗
⊂
m
 and 
m
∗
≠
m
), this is an overfitting’s case;
• if 
m
∈
ℳ
 is such that 
Θ
m
∗
⊄
Θ
m
 (also denoted 
m
∗
⊄
m
) , this is a misspecified case.
For example, if 
m
∗
 corresponds to a AR
(
2
)
 process and if 
ℳ
 contains AR
(
p
max
)
 processes and ARCH
(
q
max
)
, we have 
d
=
1
+
p
max
+
q
max
 and for 
θ
=
(
θ
i
)
0
≤
i
≤
d
,

f

k

​
X

and

​
(

Then 
Θ
m

=
{
(
θ

,
θ

,
θ

,
0
,
…
,

)
,
(
θ
0
,
θ
1
,
θ
2
)
∈
ℝ
3
}
, an AR
(
4
)
 process implies an overfitting, while an AR
(
1
)
 or an ARCH
(
2
)
 process implies a misspecified case.
In the sequel, we will always assume that

m
∗
∈
ℳ
.
This true model 
m
∗
 is supposed to be unknown. After observing the trajectory 
(
X
1
,
…
,
X
n
)
, our goal is to find the most probable model (see Section 5) among the finite family 
ℳ
 or a ”best” model that forecasts with a minimum risk. Here we have chosen a risk that is derived from a Quasi-Maximum Likelihood contrast, which is presented below.

2.2Maximum Likelihood Estimation
For each 
θ
∈
Θ
, we will begin by defining its risk by:

R
​
(
θ
)
:=
ℙ
​
γ
​
(
θ
)
=
𝔼
​
[
γ
​
(
θ
,
X
1
)
]
with
γ
​
(
θ
,
X
t
)
:=
(
X
t
−
f
θ
t
)
2
H
θ
t
+
log
⁡
(
H
θ
t
)
and
{
f
θ
t
:=
f
θ
​
(
(
X
t
−
k
)
k
≥
1
)
M
θ
t
:=
M
θ
​
(
(
X
t
−
k
)
k
≥
1
)
H
θ
t
:=
(
M
θ
t
)
2
.
(2.1)
By referring to [30] or [16], the contrast 
γ
(
θ
,
.
)
 is 
−
2
 times the Gaussian conditional log-density of 
X
t
. Moreover, the Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) is derived from the conditional (with respect to the filtration 
σ
​
{
(
X
t
)
t
≤
0
}
) log-likelihood of 
(
X
1
,
…
,
X
n
)
 when 
(
ξ
t
)
 is supposed to be a Gaussian standard white noise. We deduce that this conditional log-likelihood (up to an additional constant) 
L
n
 is defined for a parameter 
θ
 by:

L
n
​
(
θ
)
:=
−
1
2
​
∑
t
=
1
n
γ
​
(
θ
,
X
t
)
.
(2.2)
As it has been proved in [5], under a classical identifiability assumption, the risk function 
R
 achieves its unique minimum at the ”true”’ parameter 
θ
∗
 over any parameter set 
Θ
, when 
θ
∗
∈
Θ
, i.e.

θ
∗
=
argmin
θ
∈
Θ
​
R
​
(
θ
)
.
(2.3)
Therefore 
θ
∗
 is considered as an ideal predictor for the model selection procedure and serves as a benchmark to compare predictors. Given a model 
m
∈
ℳ
 and 
Θ
m
 its parameter space that does not necessarily contains 
θ
∗
, let us define

θ
m
∗
=
argmin
θ
∈
Θ
m
​
R
​
(
θ
)
.
(2.4)
As a consequence, we have:

θ
m
∗
∗
=
θ
∗
and if 
m
∗
⊂
m
,
θ
m
∗
=
θ
∗
.
Besides of minimizing the risk 
R
, we also consider the minimization of its associated loss function, which is defined as

ℓ
​
(
θ
,
θ
∗
)
:=
R
​
(
θ
)
−
R
​
(
θ
∗
)
≥
0
.
(2.5)
This is a well-known measure of separation between the candidate model generated by 
θ
 and the true one indexed by 
θ
∗
.
 
Let set by 
γ
n
 the associated empirical risk defined by

γ
n
(
θ
)
:=
ℙ
n
γ
(
θ
,
.
)
=
1
n
∑
t
=
1
n
γ
(
θ
,
X
t
)
=
−
2
n
L
n
(
θ
)
,
so that maximizing the log-likelihood is equivalent to minimize the empirical criterion 
γ
n
.

2.3Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimation
Since the white noise is not necessarily a Gaussian one and since the log-likelihood (and then the empirical risk) 
L
n
​
(
θ
)
 depends on 
(
X
t
)
t
≤
0
 that are unknown, a quasi-log-likelihood 
L
^
n
​
(
θ
)
 can be used as an approximation of the log-likelihood. It It consists of replacing 
γ
​
(
θ
,
X
t
)
 by an approximation 
γ
^

 without loss of generality).

In addition the computable empirical risk is then:

.
Finally, for each specific model 
m
∈
ℳ
n
, we define a Gaussian Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimator (QMLE) 
θ
^
m
 as

θ
^
m
∈
argmax
θ
∈
Θ
m
​
L
^
n
​
(
θ
)
=
argmin
θ
∈
Θ
m
​
γ
^
n
​
(
θ
)
.
(2.7)
The estimator 
θ
^
m
 is commonly called the Empirical Risk Minimizer (ERM).

2.4The penalization procedure
For 
m
∈
ℳ
, the ERM provides an estimator in 
Θ
m
. The goal is to come up with a model that minimizes the excess loss over 
ℳ

argmin
m
∈
ℳ
​
ℓ
​
(
θ
^
m
,
θ
∗
)
.
(2.8)
This model is unknown since (2.8) depends on 
θ
∗
 and the distribution 
P
(
X
1
,
…
,
X
n
)
 that are unknown.

A classical way to solve (2.8) problem is to design for every 
m
∈
ℳ
 an estimator of 
R
​
(
θ
^
m
)
 and we naturally choose 
γ
^
n
​
(
θ
^
m
)
. First, it is well known that the empirical criterion 
γ
^
n
​
(
θ
^
m
)
 is an optimistic version of 
R
​
(
θ
^
m
)
 and decreases with the dimension of the model. Therefore, it is common to add a penalty term to counteract this bias.
As a consequence, define a function pen: 
m
∈
ℳ
↦
pen
​
(
m
)
∈
ℝ
+
, which is called the penalty function and is possibly data-dependent. We will only require that 
pen
​
(
m
1
)
≤
pen
​
(
m
2
)
 when 
m
1
⊂
m
2
. Then define the penalized contrast and the model selected by it:

m
^
pen
=
argmin
m
∈
ℳ
​
{
C
^
pen
​
(
m
)
}
with
C
^
pen
​
(
m
)
:=
γ
^
n
​
(
θ
^
m
)
+
pen
​
(
m
)
.
(2.9)
In order to achieve (2.8), the ideal penalty to consider in (2.9) is

pen
i
​
d
​
(
m
)
=
R
​
(
θ
^
m
)
−
γ
^
n
​
(
θ
^
m
)
.
(2.10)
Using this definition, we obtain an ”ideal” model defined by:

m
^
i
​
d
:
∈
argmin
m
∈
ℳ
{
ℓ
(
θ
^
m
,
θ
∗
)
}
=
argmin
m
∈
ℳ
{
R
(
θ
^
m
)
}
=
argmin
m
∈
ℳ
{
C
^
pen
i
​
d
(
m
)
}
.
(2.11)
However, the function 
R
 is unknown except for very few particular and parametric cases and therefore 
pen
i
​
d
 cannot generally be used directly. Therefore the question is how to choose the penalty in (2.9) so that 
m
^
pen
 mimics the oracle 
m
^
i
​
d
. Hence, we would like our final estimator 
θ
^
m
^
pen
 to behave asymptotically like the oracle. That is to satisfy:

ℙ
​
(
ℓ
​
(
θ
^
m
^
pen
,
θ
∗
)
≤
min
m
∈
ℳ
​
{
ℓ
​
(
θ
^
m
,
θ
∗
)
}
+
C
n
)
​
⟶
n

​

(2.12)
and/or for any 
n
≥
n
0

[

^
pen
,
θ

)
]

​
{
𝔼
​
[
ℓ
​
(
θ
^
m
,
θ

)
]
}
+
C
n
.
(2.13)
The aim of this paper is to find a good choice of 
pen
​
(
m
)
 in order to obtain the asymptotic efficiency (2.13) or (2.12).

3Asymptotic behavior of the QMLE
Before considering the problem of model selection, we establish a central limit theorem satisfied by 
θ
^
m
 for any model 
m
∈
ℳ
, i.e. as well if 
m
 is an overfitted or a misspecified model. Before this, some notations and assumptions have to be precised.

3.1Notations and main assumptions
In the sequel, we will consider a subset 
Θ
 of 
ℝ
d
 which is compact. We will use the following norms:

• 
∥
.
∥
 denotes the usual Euclidean norm on 
ℝ
ν
, with 
ν
≥
1
;
• for a matrix 
A

)
1
/
r

]
;
• for 
θ

, if 
Ψ

;
• consider 
Ψ
θ
:

 for any 
θ
∈
Θ
⊂
ℝ
d
. Then, we define the assumption:
 
Assumption A
(
Ψ
θ
,
Θ
)
: 
‖
Ψ
θ
​
(
0
)
‖
Θ
<
∞
 and there exists a sequence of non-negative real numbers 
(
α
k
​
(
Ψ

,
Θ
)
)
k
≥
1
 such that 
∑

 and satisfying:

​
|

for all 
x
,
y
∈
ℝ
∞
.
Several assumptions on the AC class will be considered thereafter:

Assumption A0: The process 
X
∈
𝒜
​
𝒞
​
(
M
θ
∗
,
f
θ
∗
)
 where 
θ
∗
∈
Θ
 is defined in (1.1) where:

• the white noise 
(
ξ
t
)
t
 is such as 
‖
ξ
0
‖
r
<
∞
 with 
8
<
r
;
• for any 
x
∈
ℝ
∞
, the functions 
θ
→
M
θ
 and 
θ
→
f
θ
 are 
𝒞
2
​
(
Θ
)
 functions:
• 
Θ
∈
ℝ
d
 is a compact set such as
Θ
⊂
{
θ
∈
ℝ
d
,
A
(
f
θ
,
{
θ
}
)
and
A
(
M
θ
,
{
θ
}
)
hold with
∑
k
=
1
∞
α
k
(
f
θ
,
{
θ
}
)
+
∥
ξ
0
∥
r
∑
k
=
1
∞
α
k
(
M
θ
,
{
θ
}
)
<
1
}
.
(3.1)
Under this assumption, [14] showed that there exists a stationary causal (i.e. 
X
t
 is depending only on 
(
X
t
−
k
)
k
∈
ℕ
 for any 
t
∈
ℤ
) and ergodic solution of (1.1) with 
r
-order moment for any 
θ
∈
Θ
.
 
Now the assumption A0 holds. We will also add several assumptions required for insuring the strong consistency and the asymptotic normality of the QMLE:
 
The first following classical assumption ensures the identifiability of 
θ
∗
.

Assumption A1: For all 
θ
,
θ
′
∈
Θ
, 
(
f
θ
0
=
f
θ
′
0
a
n
d
M
θ
0
=
M
θ
′
0
)
a
.
s
.
⟹
θ
=
θ
′
.

Remark 1. Even if this assumption is a classic one in an M-estimation framework, it is important to remark that it does not cover all the cases of model selection of usual causal time series. Indeed, in the case of the family of ARMA processes, it is well known that a model is unique when both the polynomials 
P
0
 and 
Q
0
 of AR and MA parts are coprime. Hence, for instance, if the true model is an ARMA
(
p
0
,
q
0
)
 process, any ARMA
(
p
0
+
1
,
q
0
+
1
)
 representation with respective polynomials 
P
​
(
X
)
=
P
0
​
(
X
)
​
(
X
−
r
)
 and 
Q
​
(
X
)
=
Q
0
​
(
X
)
​
(
X
−
r
)
 of AR and MA parts, is identically the same as the true model whatever 
r
∈
ℝ
. Then, Assumption A1 is never satisfied for ARMA processes in case of overfitting. However, by initializing 
θ
 around 
0
 in the optimization algorithm, we have noticed from Monte-Carlo experiments that the algorithm always converges to 
θ
∗
 and not other solution.
Next, the following Assumption ensures the invertibility of the asymptotic covariance matrix 
G
 and 
F
 (see below) that is necessary to prove the asymptotic normality of the QMLE (see for instance [5]).

Assumption A2: 
<
α
,
∂
θ
f
θ

0
⟹
α
=
0
​
a
.
s
.
 or 
<
α
,
∂
θ
M
θ

>=
0
⟹
α
=

​
a

s
.

The definition of the computable empirical risk and requires that its denominators do not vanish. Hence, we are going to assume throughout this paper that the lower bound of 
H
θ
​
(
⋅
)
=
(
M
θ
​
(
⋅
)
)
2
 is strictly positive:

Assumption A3: 
∃
h
¯
>

 such that 
inf
θ
∈
Θ
​
(
H
θ
​
(
x
)
)
≥
h
¯
 for all 
x
∈
ℝ
∞
.

The following assumption is a technical classical condition (see [28]).

Assumption A4: For every 
m
∈
ℳ
, if 
(
θ
¯
m
,
n
)
 is a sequence of 
Θ
m
 satisfying 
θ
¯
m
,
n
​
⟶
a

s

n

​

, then

Remark 2. Note that under assumption A0, if

a

s

n

​

Thus, from the Egorov’s Theorem, we can find an event 
Ω
~
 with sufficiently large probability such that the relation (3.2) in the assumption A4 holds if the expectation is taken on the event 
Ω
~
. For the particular case of the linear processes, the assumption A4 holds true under a mild condition on the distribution of 
X
, see for instance [32] and [15].

)
j
 and 
(
α

)
j
 have to be fast enough for insuring the strong consistency and the asymptotic normality of the QMLE:

where

.

Note that Assumption A5 does not allow to consider long-range dependent processes, but usual short memory causal time series satisfy this assumption.

3.2New asymptotic results satisfied by 
θ
^
m
The asymptotic normality of 
θ
^
m
 has been already established in [5] when 
m
=
m
∗
 and in [4] when 
m
∗
⊂
m
 (overfitting). This property can also be extended in the case of misspecified model, i.e. when 
m
∗
⊄
m
.
 
First, the following corollary is a particular case of a more general result, Proposition 4, which is stated in Section 8 devoted to the proofs.
To begin with, and from Assumption A2 and A5, we can define the definite positive matrix

G
​
(
θ
)
:=
1
4
​
(
∑
t
∈

(3.4)
Now, for any 
m
∈
ℳ
 and 
θ

, denote:

G

​
(

:=

​

Corollary 1. Let 
m
∈
ℳ
 and suppose that Assumptions A0-A5 hold. Then, with 
θ

 defined in (2.4),
1
n

)
.
(3.7)
Using mainly this new result, we also obtain:

Theorem 3.1. Under Assumptions A0-A5, for any

,
(3.8)
with 
G
m
 and 
F

 defined in (3.5) and (3.6).

Hence, even in the misspecified case, 
θ
^
m
 satisfies a central limit theorem. We will use this result several times, in particular to prove that the probability of selecting a misspecified model tends quickly enough towards 
0
. Another technical result will also be useful for the sequel:

4Efficient model selection
The expectation of the ideal penalty (2.10) has been computed (or asymptotically approximated) in several frameworks (see [29], [1], [34], [19], [7]; etc) and it is most often proportional to the dimension of the model (denoted 
|
m
|
 in the sequel).

• the penalty is 
2

​
σ

 in the regression setting, leading to the famous Mallows’s 
C
p
 criterion [29];
• the penalty is

 in the density estimation framework and others, leading to the famous AIC criterion [1];
• the penalty is

 in the Bayesian density estimation setting and other frameworks, leading to the famous BIC criterion [34] ;
• the penalty is 
Trace
​
(

)
/
n
 where 
A
n
 is the opposite of the Hessian matrix of the log-likelihood and 
B
n
 the Fisher Information matrix in a general framework issued from a Bayesian setting [28].
In order to approximate (2.10) in this framework, let first provide a decomposition of this term in order to facilitate the computation. For any model 
m
∈
ℳ
, write

pen
i
​
d
​
(

)
:=

​
(

Next we provide a preliminary result about the asymptotic behavior of the terms

 and

. Then we obtain:

The proof of this lemma, as well as all the other proofs, can be found in Section 8. This result leads to our first main result:

Proposition 2. Under Assumptions A0-A5, there exists 
N

(4.14)
Another application of Lemma 1 is devoted to an expansion of the expectation of the ideal penalty defined in (2.10):

Proposition 3. Under Assumptions A0-A5 and for any 
m
∈
ℳ
, there exists a bounded sequence 
(
v

)
n
∈

∗
, not depending on 
m
 when

(4.15)
Note that the Slope Heuristic Procedure, which allows to estimate a so called minimal penalty (see [2]) consists in evaluating the slope of a linear regression of 
γ
^
n
​
(
θ
^
m
)
 onto 
|
m
|
 for 
m
∗
⊂
m
 and this is equivalent to estimating the slope of 
1
n
​
Trace
​
(
G

​
(
θ

)
​
F
m
​
(
θ

)
−
1
)
 onto 
|
m
|
 from (4.13). We will see that 
Trace
​
(
G
m
​
(
θ
m
∗
)
​
F
m
​
(
θ
m
∗
)
−
1
)
 behaves as a linear function of 
|
m
|
 in many cases, which also gives legitimacy to this approach in the case of time series after having obtained it in the case of linear regression. The minimal penalty is then 
−
2
×
 the estimated slope and this finally corresponds to an approximation of 
𝔼
​
[
pen
i
​
d
​
(
m
)
]
. The trace of the matrix mentioned above is easily computable in some cases using the explicit forms of the matrices 
F
​
(
θ
∗
)
, 
G
​
(
θ
∗
)
 in [5]. Hence, even if the ideal penalty cannot be explicitely obtained, we can replace it with its expectation, i.e. this trace of matrix. Then, define for 
m
∈
ℳ
,

pen
~
​
(
m
)
:=
−
2
n
​
Trace
​
(
(
F
​
(
θ
m
∗
)
)
−
1
​
G
​
(
θ
m
∗
)
)
.
(4.16)
As shown in Section 6, this trace is proportional to the dimension of the model 
|
m
|
 in some cases, but could be more complex functions of 
|
m
|
. In case of Gaussian process, we will also see that it corresponds to the AIC penalty, 
2
/
n
. However, we will see that this penalty does not provide a consistent model selection and contrary to the ideal penalty, does not provide an optimal efficient model criterion.
Before this, we study the probability of not selecting a misspecified model under a general condition on the penalty that is satisfied for instance by 
pen
~
 or by BIC criterion:

Theorem 4.1. Under Assumptions A0-A5 and if for any 
ε
>
0
,
n
​
ℙ
​
(
pen
​

m
)
≥

)
​
⟶
n
→

​
0
for any 
m
∈
ℳ
.
(4.17)
Then,

n
​
ℙ
​
(
m
∗
⊄
m
^
pen
)
​
⟶
n
→

​
0
.
(4.18)
Theorem 4.1 says that if the penalty asymptotically decreases to 
0
 in probability, then the criterion 
C
^
pen
 does not select a misspecified model asymptotically.
Now, we state the main results of this paper, which specify the convergence rate of pen to obtain an excess loss close to the minimal one over 
ℳ
:

Theorem 4.2. Under Assumptions A0-A5, and if for any

(4.20)
Remark 3. Let notice that this asymptotic optimality is quite a bit different from the classical one about asymptotic efficiency, where both the cardinal of the collection 
ℳ
 and the dimension of competitive models are allowed to depend on 
n
. However, this is done in the framework where the parameter 
θ
∗
 is infinite-dimensional (see for example [37], [26], [18]).
Now, we provide a condition on the penalty allowing to obtain a consistent criterion. Moreover, we also prove that such criterion satisfies a sharper efficiency inequality than (4.20):

Theorem 4.3. Under Assumptions A0-A5, if the penalty pen satisfies (4.17), and if for any

 since

The best known criterion satisfying the conditions of this theorem and in particular (4.21) is certainly the BIC criterion for which 
pen
​

​

. This is also such a case for Hannan-Quinn criterion (

​

, see [17]) or if 
pen
​

​
|

|
 as we used it in [4]. Note also that both the consistent data-driven criteria mentioned in the next section (see (5.4) defined in [23], and (5.5)) also verify the conditions of Theorem 4.3.
On the contrary, the AIC criterion with 
pen
​
(
m
)
=
2
n
​
|
m
|
, or the criterion with penalty 
pen
~
​
(
m

 do not satisfy these conditions. The following theorem even shows that these criteria asymptotically overfit and have a less good asymptotic efficiency than consistent criteria satisfying Theorem 4.3:

Theorem 4.4. Assume that there exists 
g

[
 such as 
pen
​
(

​
(

 for any

. Then, under Assumptions A0-A5, the probability of overfitting is asymptotically positive i.e.
lim inf
n
→

ℙ
​
(
m

)

(4.25)
and there exists 
M
>

 such as for 
n
 large enough,

𝔼

(4.26)
Corollary 2. Theorem 4.4 is valid for 
pen
​
(
m
)
=
2
n
​
|
m
|
 (AIC criterion) or 
pen
=
pen
~
.
To conclude, in this context where a true model belonging to a finite family of models exists, the consistent criteria are those which also propose the best asymptotic efficiency. The next section focuses on these. However, a criterion like the AIC criterion or more generally the criterion with penalty 
pen
~
 regain all their optimality properties in asymptotic efficiency when the model family is infinite or when the true model does not belong to the family.

5From a Bayesian model selection to a data-driven consistent model selection
Another classical paradigm for model selection is the Bayesian one, leading typically to the BIC criterion (see [34]). In this approach, the construction of the model selection criterion is first done by assuming that the parameter vector 
θ
∗
 is a random vector. Let recall the hierarchical prior sampling scheme in the Bayesian setting: given the finite family of models 
ℳ
, a model 
m
 is drawn according to a prior distribution 
(
π
m
)
m
∈
ℳ
 (generally a uniform distribution) and then, conditionally on 
m
, 
θ
 is sampled according to some prior distribution 
μ
m
​
(
θ
)
.
 
The goal of this model selection procedure is to choose the most probable model after observing the trajectory 
X
:=
(
X
1
,
⋯
,
X
n
)
, i.e.

m
^
B
=
argmax
m
∈
ℳ
​
{
ℙ
​
(
m
|
X
)
}
.
(5.1)
Using Bayes Formula, we can write 
ℙ
​
(
m
|
X
)
=
π
m
​
ℙ
​
(
X
|
m
)
ℙ
​
(
X
)
.
 Moreover, we have:

ℙ
​
(
X
|
m
)
=
∫
Θ
m
ℙ
​
(
X
|
θ
,
m
)
​
𝑑
μ
m
​
(
θ
)
.
In addition, since 
ℙ
​
(
X
)
 does not depend on 
m
, and 
ℙ
​
(
X
|
θ
,
m
)
 is the likelihood of 
X
 given 
θ
∈
Θ
m
 and 
m
∈
ℳ
, maximizing 
ℙ
​
(
m
|
X
)
 is equivalent to maximize

S
^
n
​
(
m
,
X
)
:=
log

(
ℙ
​
(

)

​
exp
⁡
(
L
n
​
(
θ
)
)
​
𝑑
μ
m
​
(
θ
)
)
.
From now on, we will assume that 
π
m
=
1
/
|
ℳ
|
 for any 
m
∈
ℳ
, a priori uniform distribution of the models in the family 
ℳ
. We can also assume that there exists a non-negative Borel function 
θ
→
b
m
​
(
θ
)
 such as 
d
​
μ
m
​
(
θ
)
=
b
m
​
(
θ
)
​
d
​
θ
. Then we have:

S

(5.2)
Let us give an asymptotic expansion of the a posteriori probability in order to derive a BIC type criterion that is coherent with our framework where the observed trajectory is that of a causal affine process. This could be obtained from a Laplace approximation, leading to the following theorem:

Theorem 5.1. Under Assumptions A0, A1, A2, A3, A5 and if for any 
x
∈
R
∞
, the functions 
θ

 and A
(

 for any

≤
k
≤

. Then
S

=

γ

​
(

)
i
,
j
∈

.

In the above equation, it is clear that 
−

​
S
^
n
​
(
m
,
X
)
≃
−

​
L

 a.s.. This gives legitimacy to the usual BIC criterion within the framework of causal affine processes since:

m
^
B
​
I
​
C
=
argmin
m
∈
ℳ
⁡
{
−
2
​
L
^
n
​
(
θ

m
)
+
log
⁡
(

)
​
|

}
,
and we see that 
m
^
B
​
I
​
C
 maximizes the main terms of 
S
^
n
​
(
m
,
X
)
.
From the relation (5.3), considering certain second order terms of the asymptotic expansion of 
S
^
n
​
(
m
,
X
)
, we also obtain the Kashyap criterion (see Kashyap [23], Sclove [35], Bozdogan [6]), denoted 
K
​
C
 criterion, defined for all 
m
∈
ℳ
 by

K
​

(5.4)
Therefore the term 
log
⁡
(
det

−
F
^
n
​
(
m
)
)
)
 is added to the usual BIC criterion. Several examples of computations of this term, generally equal to 
c
​

m
|
 but not always, are provided in the forthcoming Section 6. It is clear that

 in terms of consistency only for non asymptotic framework (typically for

 of the order of a hundred or several hundred). Note also that the data-driven criteria 
K
​
C
 that is ”optimal” in the sense of the a posteriori probability (see Kashyap [23]) is also asymptotically consistent under the Assumption A5.
However, this choice of second order terms of the asymptotic expansion of 
S
^
n
​
(

,

)
 is somewhere arbitrary. A criterion taking account of all the second order terms could also be defined. For this, we could define a uniform distribution 
b

 on a compact set included in 
Θ

. As a consequence, using condition (3.1) of Assumption A0, there always exists

 where 
F
 is defined in (3.4). Therefore the term 
log

(
det

)
)
 can also be replaced by 
log

)
 in the expression of

.
Corollary 3. The criteria BIC, KC and KC’ are consistent model selection criteria and satisfy Theorem 4.3.
Thus, these three criteria are asymptotically consistent and asymptotically efficient following the inequalities (4.23) and (4.24). Monte-Carlo experiments in Section 7 will also exhibit that 
m
^
K
​
C

, which is a data-driven criterion, outperforms 
m

​
I
​
C
 in terms of consistency and efficiency when the 
n
 size of the trajectory is of the order of a hundred or a thousand.

Here there are 3 frameworks where

 can be computed for

:
 
1/ A first and well-known case is the Gaussian case. Indeed, when 
(
ξ

 is a Gaussian white noise, then 
μ

 and then from (6.1), for any 
i

with 
I
ℓ
 the identity matrix of size 
ℓ
∈
ℕ
∗
. As a consequence, in the Gaussian framework, for 
m
∗
⊂
m
, the expectation of the ideal penalty is exactly the classical Akaike Criterion (AIC).
 
2/ A frequent case is when the parameter 
θ
 identifying an affine causal model 
X

​

 can be decomposed as

=

 and

 such that

p

This setting includes many classical times series:

• For ARMA

 processes, we have 
X

 since

 for all

∈

. Then 
θ

=
(

…
,
a
p
,
b

)
 and 
θ

=
σ
. The penalty term is slightly different according to 
σ
 is known or not:
(a) if 
σ
 is known, then 
θ
=
θ
1
 and 
G
m
​
(
θ

)
=
−
F
m
​
(
θ

, so that we recover exactly the AIC penalty term:
−

​
Trace

=

=

​
(

)
;
(b) if 
σ
 is unknown, 
θ
=

)
 and simple computations lead to

Thus, we obtain

 and therefore, with

and therefore once again the expectation of the ideal penalty leads to the AIC model selection.
• For GARCH

Then we have

 As a result:

.
• For APARCH
(

 processes (see [13]), we also have 
f

 and 
X

For such a process,

 when we assume that

3/ Otherwise, the computations are no longer easy. Let us see the example of the family of 
A
​
R
​
(

)
−
A
​
R
​
C
​
H
​
(

 processes. Then for any 
t
∈

 we have 
X

ϕ
​
X

Z

 where 
Z
t
=

⋯
+
α
p
​
Z
t
−
p

)
1
/
2
. As a consequence, with 
θ
=
(
ϕ
,
α

,
…
,
α
p
)
′
, we obtain for any 
t
∈
ℤ
,

X
t
=
f
θ
​
(
X

M
θ
​
(
X

)
​
ξ

with
{

=
ϕ
​
X

M
θ
​
(
X

.
Thus the parameter 
ϕ
 is present in 
f
θ
 as well as in 
M
θ
. From (6.1), and with the notations of 1/, we obtain:

F

As a consequence,

Thus, with

7Numerical Studies
This section aims to investigate the numerical behavior of the model selection criteria studied in Section 4 and Section 5 using R software.

To do that, three Data Generating Processes (DGP) have been considered:

DGP I	AR(2)

=
0.4
​

+
0.4
​
σ
t
−
1
2
,
where 
(
ξ
t
)
t
 is a Gaussian white noise with variance unity.

Remark 5. As already observed in the Remark 1, Assumption A1 is never satisfied for ARMA processes in case of overfitting. However, in the used optimization under constraint algorithm (program nloptr), we initialized 
θ
 at 
0
 (except for the variance estimator). By this way, we have noticed in Monte-Carlo experiments that the algorithm always converges to 
θ
∗
 and not other solution due to the overfitting.
In order to illustrate the obtained theoretical asymptotic behaviors, we have realized Monte-Carlo experiments where the performance of the AIC, BIC and KC’ criteria are compared using the following parameters:

• The considered family of competitive models is the same for the three DGP
ℳ
=
{
ARMA
​
(
p
,
q
)
​
and
​
GARCH
​
(
p
,
q
)
​
processes
​
with
​
  0
≤
p
,
q
≤
6
}
.
• Several values of 
n
, the observed trajectory length, are considered: 200, 500, 1000, 2000.
• For each 
n
 and DGP, we have generated 500 independent replications of the trajectories.
Hence, for each replication, the selected models 
m
^
A
​
I
​
C
, 
m
^
B
​
I
​
C
 and 
m
^
K
​
C
′
 are computed. Then,

1. The consistency property is illustrated by the computation of the frequency (percentage) of selecting the true model versus a model other than the true one (called here ”wrong”).
2. For the efficiency property (Theorem 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4), we first compute a very sharp estimator 
R
~
 of the risk function 
R
 for each DGP: 
R
~
=
γ
^
N
 computed from an independent and very large (
N
=
10

) trajectory of the DGP. By this way, and we obtain an estimator

 for

​
I
​
C

m

​

​
C
 and 
m

​

. Then, we compute
M

where 
ℓ

 is the average of 
ℓ

 over the 500 replications. Therefore 
M
​
E

 is an estimator of 
n

The results of Monte-Carlo experiments are reported in Table 1, devoted to the consistency property, and in Table 2, devoted to the efficiency property.

Conclusions of numerical experiments:

• Concerning the consistency properties, the numerical results of Table 1 show that the percentages of choice of the true model tend towards 100 for increasing 
n
 and with the criteria BIC and KC’, and this corresponds well to the obtained asymptotic result (Corollary 3). And as it could also be deduced from the theory (see Corollary 2) the AIC criterion is not a consistent one. Moreover, we observe that the KC’ criterion outperforms BIC when dealing as well as small and large samples for all considered DGP. These results confirm that it is important to also consider the neglected terms in the derivation of the BIC criterion.
• From the results of Table 2, we notice a decrease of the residual term 
M
​
E
^
 to 
0
 for increasing 
n
 for the consistent criteria BIC and KC’. This corresponds well to the 
o
​
(
1
/
n
)
 term observed in (4.24). We also observe that this convergence to 0 is globally faster with the KC’ criterion than with the BIC one. Thus, in terms of efficiency as well as in terms of consistency, the KC’ criterion performs even better than the BIC one for the selected DGPs. Finally, as shown by Theorems 4.2 and 4.4, the statistic 
M
​
E
^
 seems asymptotically bounded and does not converge to 
0
 when the AIC criterion is applied to select the model. This confirms that BIC and especially KC’ criteria are more accurate in terms of efficiency than AIC criterion.

The main tool we use here for establishing Theorem 4 is the notion of 
τ
-dependence for stationary time series and more precisely, the 
τ
-dependence coefficients, which are a version of the coupling coefficients introduced in [11] and used for stationary infinite memory chains. The reader is deferred to the lecture notes [10] for complements and details on coupling, based on the Wasserstein distance between probabilities defined as below. Its stationary version is:

Definition 1. Let 
(
Ω
,
𝒞
,
ℙ
)
 be a probability space, 
ℳ
 a 
σ
-subalgebra of 
𝒞
 and 
Z
 a random variable with values in 
E
. Assume that 
‖
Z
‖
p
<

 and define the coefficient 
τ
(

 as
τ

​

}
‖
p
.
Using the definition of 
τ
, the dependence between the past of the sequence 
(
Z

)
t
∈
ℤ
 and its future 
k
-tuples may be assessed: consider the norm

Finally, the time series

t

 is 
τ
Z
(

-weakly dependent when its coefficients 
τ

Now using Assumption A4, Lemmas 4 and 5, we deduce (3.9). ∎

Proof of Lemma 1.1. From the assumptions, the function 
R
:
θ

​

𝒞

​
(

 function and the Hessian matrix 
∂

R

​
F
 is a definite positive matrix (see (3.4)). Therefore, from a Taylor-Lagrange expansion:

The computation of the expectation of

Finally, for establishing

​
⟶
n

​
𝔼

, we have to prove that there exists

(8.17)
Indeed, from (8.14), we have:

⟹
𝔼

[

,
(8.18)
since there exists

 for any

 from Assumption A5 where 
Θ
 is a compact set.
Using Proposition 1, we know that

sup

​
(

.
Finally using (8.18), we deduce (8.17).
 
2. As in the proof of 1., we use a Taylor-Lagrange expansion of 
γ
^
n
​
(
θ

)
 around 
θ
^

 since 
∂
θ
γ
^

​
(

)
=

. Then,

n
​
(
γ

​
(

​

)
​
n
​
(

.
But using 
θ

​
⟶
a

n

​
θ

 and 
𝔼

​
L

n

​
⟶
𝒫
n

​
F
​

.
Therefore, using the same reasoning as in 1., we deduce that

n

​
⟶

U

.
With Hölder Inequality and using

 defined in Proposition 1, we obtain for 
n
 large enough

𝔼
​
[
n
​

Finally, with Proposition 1 and Lemma 4 of [5], we have 
sup

​

which concludes the proof. ∎

Proof of Proposition 2.For

But the matrix

If

⟹

Secondly, from Assumption A0 and [5], there exists

Therefore, there exist

. Using this and (8.23) we deduce that for any 
m
∈
ℳ
, there exists a bounded sequence 
(
v

)
n
∈
ℕ

 not depending on

 when

 satisfying

𝔼

(8.24)
Using also Lemma 1, this implies the asymptotic behavior of 
𝔼
​
[

]
. ∎

Now we establish a preliminary lemma that is an important step towards the proof of Theorem 4.2.

Lemma 7. Let 
pen
:
m
∈
ℳ
n
↦
pen
​
(
m
)
∈
ℝ
+
. Then,
ℓ
​
(

≤
min
m
∈

​
{

)
−
pen
i
​
d
​
(
m
^

)
)
.
(8.25)
Proof.By definition, for any 
m
∈
ℳ
,
C
^
pen
i
​
d
​
(
m
)
=
R
​
(

=
ℓ
​
(

θ

+
R
​
(
θ

.
(8.26)
As a consequence,

min
m
∈
ℳ
​
{
ℓ

=

​

=
min

​
{

​
d
​
(

}
−
R
​
(
θ

.
(8.27)
For any 
m
∈
ℳ
, we also have

C
^
pen
​
(
m
)
=
C
^
pen
i
​
d
​
(
m
)
+
pen
​
(

−
pen
i
​
d
​
(

.
By definition of 
m
^
pen
, we have 
C
^
pen
​
(
m
^
pen
)
≤
C
^
pen
​
(
m
^

​
d
)
. Therefore,

C
^
pen
​
(
m
^
pen
)
≤
C
^
pen
i
​
d
​
(
m
^

+
pen
​
(

−

C

(

−

.
By replacing 
C
^

i
​
d
​
(
m
)
 by 
ℓ
​
(
θ
^
m
,
θ

+
R
​
(

 following (8.26) and using (8.27), then (8.25) is established. ∎

Therefore, using Proposition 1,

Consider now

Using [5], we know that

 is a stationary time series, 
τ

Finally, we deduce that there exists

(8.32)
By this way, (4.18) is established. ∎

Proof of Theorem 4.2.The proof is mainly based on Lemma 7. From the proof of Lemma 1, we deduce that for any 
m
∈
ℳ
, there exists two positive random variables 
Y
​
(

 and 
Z
​
(

 such as 
n

 and

|
I

​
(
m
)
|
≤
Z
​
(

 for any 
n
∈
ℕ
∗
. Moreover, 
Y
​
(
m
)
 and 
Z
​
(
m
)
 have bounded expectations. Therefore, using Markov Inequality, since 
ℳ
 is supposed to be a finite family of models, for any 
ε
>
0
 there exists 
K
ε
′
>
0
 such as
lim sup
n

max

ℙ
​
(

pen

d

.
Therefore, using this inequality and (4.19), we deduce that for any 
ε

 there exist 
M
ε

0
 and 
N
ε
∈
ℕ

 such that for any

Using the limit (8.39) as well as (8.38), we deduce with Markov inequality that

Now, using the expectation of (8.34), we also obtain

Now, by using (8.38) and (8.39) as well as Proposition 2, we obtain the proof of (4.24). ∎

Proof of Theorem 5.1.We first verify conditions (C1) and (C2) of [8] that are sufficient to imply Conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of [24]. Condition (C1) requires that
