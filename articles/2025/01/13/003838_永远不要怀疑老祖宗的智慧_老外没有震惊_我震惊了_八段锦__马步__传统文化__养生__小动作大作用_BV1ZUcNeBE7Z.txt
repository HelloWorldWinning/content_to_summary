Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Core Idea:**
    *   An artist documented body movements using a camera attached via a chain.
    *   The internal heat, initially concentrated in the core organs, is depicted as shifting downwards.
    *   This shift causes warming of the lower legs and feet.
    *   The extremities (hands, feet, head) become intensely red, as if filled with blood.

2.  **Core Point (One Sentence):** The artist's recorded movements show a visceral redistribution of heat and blood towards the extremities.

3.  **Fundamental Point (One Sentence):** The artwork uses bodily motion and heat transference to represent the movement of internal energy or vitality to the external parts of the body.

4.  **Overarching Framework:** The content outlines an artistic representation of physiological changes brought on by movement, specifically focusing on the redistribution of heat and blood within the body.

Content:
 The artist recorded every movement as a vaginal engine using a chain for red camera. It's clear that from the shaking the head and, wagging the tail to dispel hard fire, the red areas originally, concentrated in the internal organs, gradually sink to the lower body. The lower legs and feet become warmer. The hands, feet and head of pure red, as key and blood being directed to the extremities.
