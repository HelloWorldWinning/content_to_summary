Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Movement as a Vaginal Engine:**
    *   The artist uses a chain-linked red camera to record movement.
    *   Movement is conceptualized as a "vaginal engine."

2.  **Shifting Red Areas:**
    *   Initial red concentration is in internal organs.
    *   The shaking of the head and wagging of the tail are actions that dispel "hard fire."
    *   Red concentration progressively shifts to the lower body.
    *   Lower legs and feet become warmer.
    *   Hands, feet, and head become purely red, signifying blood flow to the extremities.

3.  **Key Areas of Emphasis:**
    *   Internal organs (initial concentration).
    *   Lower body, especially legs and feet.
    *   Extremities: Hands, feet, and head.

**Core Point:** The artist uses movement, captured by a unique recording device, to depict a shift in energy and blood flow within the body, moving from the core to the extremities.

**Fundamental Point:** The work explores the body's response to movement, represented by the visual shift of red areas, suggesting a transformation of internal heat and blood circulation.

**Overarching Framework:**
The piece uses a metaphorical approach that draws parallels between movement and physiological processes, with a distinct focus on the "vaginal engine" concept to explore internal energy shifts.

Content:
 The artist recorded every movement as a vaginal engine using a chain for red camera. It's clear that from the shaking the head and, wagging the tail to dispel hard fire, the red areas originally, concentrated in the internal organs, gradually sink to the lower body. The lower legs and feet become warmer. The hands, feet and head of pure red, as key and blood being directed to the extremities.
