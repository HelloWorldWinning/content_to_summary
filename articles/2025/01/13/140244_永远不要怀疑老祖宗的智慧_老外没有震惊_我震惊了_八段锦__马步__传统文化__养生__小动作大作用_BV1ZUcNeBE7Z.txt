Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Artistic Method:**
    *   The artist used a camera attached via a chain to their body, specifically as a "vaginal engine", to record movement.
2.  **Observed Transformation:**
    *   Initial focus of "red" (presumably heat or energy) was concentrated in the internal organs.
    *   Movement (shaking head, wagging tail) seems to be the mechanism to dispel "hard fire".
    *   The "red" then gradually migrates downwards, warming the lower body.
    *   Ultimately, the "red" becomes concentrated in the hands, feet, and head.

3. **Core Point:** The artwork depicts a physical transformation and redistribution of energy (or heat) within the body, using movement as the catalyst.

4.  **Fundamental Point:** The performance explores the body as a dynamic system, where movement and internal energy are interconnected and transformative.

5. **Overarching Framework:** The content illustrates a physical and symbolic process of energy transfer, utilizing the body as a vessel and medium, and movement as the agent for change.

Content:
 The artist recorded every movement as a vaginal engine using a chain for red camera. It's clear that from the shaking the head and, wagging the tail to dispel hard fire, the red areas originally, concentrated in the internal organs, gradually sink to the lower body. The lower legs and feet become warmer. The hands, feet and head of pure red, as key and blood being directed to the extremities.
