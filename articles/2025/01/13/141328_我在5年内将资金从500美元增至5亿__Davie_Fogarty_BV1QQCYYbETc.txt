 My name's Davy and this is my story, however, from $500 to $500 million. I was a very insecure kid, I was slightly pudgy and now I'm on the Australian financial rich list. Under you Margot Robbie, I have bought my dream home, bought my girlfriend a dream car. I don't actually like telling these stories. Sometimes I feel like they come off very very arrogant, especially for people that don't know me and I'm slightly introverted, but it is a really good story for young entrepreneurs to hear and there's lots of lessons. So here it is, this is my story from $500 to $500 million in just five years. So I was born in not a huge city in Australia, it's called Adelaide. I was a very insecure kid. I was the kid that went to the beach and just wouldn't take that shirt off. I would have to swim in my shirt. I had a very supportive family when I was young. They supported me both emotionally, but they also worked incredibly hard to support me financially. After school, I would go and watch them sell furniture. They had a small furniture business in Adelaide and I would just get to watch them constantly just, you know, working really, really hard to put me through school. School is difficult for me for a very long time. I was told that I was stupid at a very young age, especially through primary school and I believed it. It was probably exacerbating my insecurities and I just never tried. Constantly arguing with teachers, constantly getting detentions and everything was just felt like it was going downhill. I had a parent teacher interview, I think it was grade 10. All of my five teachers just said that I was failing and I was incredibly difficult to teach. After that, my parents pretty much had enough. They gave me an ultimatum to either start working hard or they're going find another school or even just stop supporting me overall. I felt a deep feeling of shame at that point. I knew that there was something within me. I knew that I wasn't stupid and I had a decent amount of intelligence enough to make a good life for myself. But it wasn't until I was scrolling through YouTube. I used to watch my numbing viral videos Charlie bit me and I came across all of the old Nike commercials. These were so, so exhilarating in every single way. They would, you would watch them and you could just feel like you would run through a wall. I watched the Jordan commercial where he talks about how many game winning shots that he's taken and he's lost. After that moment, I started to pick up that all greatness was just a willingness to work hard and fail. So I knew I needed a plan. I needed to get better grades. I needed to get a job and I needed to go to university to make money. Well, I thought university was the right path at that time. This was the path that I could feel better about myself and maybe achieve greatness, which I didn't actually really know what it was then but I knew I wanted to do something awesome. The first job I was moving things around in a warehouse and I was getting minimum wage, which I think was about $16 an hour even back then. Then I used that money to go to the gym. I started to get absolutely obsessed with the gym, which made me feel so much better and was a kind of a first lesson that small bits of compounded effort can actually improve over time and just help your mental and physical health. Then I got a tutor as well to help me with the subjects that I was struggling with. I enrolled in difficult subjects like mass physics, chemistry. I knew I was working when one year after I decided to change, I had a parent teaching interview. I only had one teacher that was the same as previously. He said in my career, I've never seen a child turn their life around as much as David has this year, which really cemented that I was on the right track and ended up finishing school on pretty good grades and getting into mining engineering. I just chose mining engineering because I thought it sounded cool and you could go straight into a six-figure job, which sounded also cool. On my first day of mining engineering, I walked into this giant amp fifth theatre in Adelaide University and I couldn't even see the lecturer. He was so far away. He was on a big screen and he said, you're all used to being the smartest in your class. Look to the left, look to the right. Only one of you is going to pass this class and it turns out I was not one of those people. I hated university. I didn't like the subject. I was only doing it because I got told that I could get six figures out of it and it sounded cool and because there is no structured or forced way of turning up, I didn't rock up at all and ended up failing. I'd say one of the main reasons why I've had university was because I was just so passionate about business and I just was constantly launching new things. I was trying to sell with singlets and hats and I actually started making a fair bit of money on Instagram. I started an Instagram where I would go into supplement stores and take photos of the supplements and write reviews, what's good about them, then I was able to sell advertising on those Instagrams to fitness T brands and that kind of stuff. I could start it off small, make $5 here, $10 here. I'd be out on a-
