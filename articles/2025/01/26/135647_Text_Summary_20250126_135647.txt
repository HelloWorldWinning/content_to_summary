好的，以下是对您提供的文本的总结，包含核心要点，框架，以及mermaid图表：

**1. 核心要点 (Core Point):**

DeepSeek R1 在一个复杂的 Python 编程挑战中，首次实现了一次性通过所有单元测试，展现了强大的代码生成和推理能力。

**2. 基本要点 (Fundamental Point):**

DeepSeek R1 在单次尝试中成功解决了复杂的编程问题，这突显了其相对于 OpenAI o1 和 Claude 3.5 Sonnet 的代码生成和推理能力的潜在优势。

**3. 总体框架 (Overarching Framework):**

   *   **引言:** 对比 DeepSeek R1，OpenAI o1 和 Claude 3.5 Sonnet 的编码能力，并提及基准测试结果。
   *   **测试设置:** 使用 Exercism 上的 REST API Python 练习作为硬编码挑战，模拟实际开发场景。
   *   **DeepSeek R1 表现:**
        *   首次尝试通过所有单元测试，显示出卓越的推理和代码生成能力。
        *   详细的思维链过程。
   *   **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 表现:**
        *   首次尝试失败，未能理解payload类型，需要反馈进行修正。
   *   **OpenAI o1 表现:**
        *  首次尝试部分通过，存在错误，需要反馈进行修正。
   *   **结论:** DeepSeek R1 在此挑战中表现突出，后续将进行更大规模的测试，并关注其他模型。

we'll compare the coding abilities of the Open Source DeepSeek R1 against OpenAI's o1 and Claude 3. 5 Sonnet. R1 gets second place on Aider's coding benchmark just below o1. It ranks above both Claude 3. 5 Sonnet and DeepSeek three on the polyglot benchmark. I saw a discrepancy on the Aider benchmark for the Sonnet results from last year. It was 45 percent and today it's 52 percent, putting it above DeepSeek 3 all of a sudden. Let's get coding. We are going to use a hard coding exercise from a platform used by Aider benchmarks called Exercism, which is a platform which teaches people to code. The exercises are all open source. You'll find the repo URL in the description. We are going to use a hard Python exercise called rest API. The exercise requires some endpoints to be implemented in order to implement an IOU API. This exercise requires planning, coding ability, understanding and reasoning. OpenAI's o1 and Sonnet haven't been able to one shot it. If you go to their repo, under exercises you'll find practice, then a list of all the exercises for the selected programming language. Every folder contains a unit test file which tests the implementation. The idea is not to see the unit tests but implement the logic by following instructions, just like with Leetcode. Every exercise folder has a dot docs subfolder which contains the instructions markdown file. Let's copy the instructions into the Deepseek R1 chat window. Let's copy over the Rest API class which needs to be implemented and the Aider prompt which is used in Aider benchmarks. This video was created before Aider supported Deepseek R1, hence the use of the web UI. We'll just modify the prompt a bit and send it to R1. As we can see, it starts by thinking, just like o1 does. A big difference is that R1 gives much more detail in its chain of thought than o1. R1 thought for 139 seconds, which is impressive for test time compute. Let's save the code to a Python file. Let's rename it so the unit test can find the class. Let's run the unit tests with pytest. This is very very impressive. It got all 9 unit tests to pass. No model ever got this right in one shot. To compare apples with apples, let's give the same coding challenge to Claude 3. 5 Sonnet. I challenge you to try out this exercise and time yourself. Leave a comment with how long it took you to complete the challenge. Sonnet seems to be done, let's copy the code and test it. All 9 tests fail. This is because Sonnet couldn't use the examples to reason that the payload should be a string and not an object. Let's copy the error and let it try to fix it. It seems to understand where it went wrong. If we run the tests with the updated code then all tests pass. It needed some feedback first before getting it right, which might lose it a coding interview. Now let's see how o1 handles the same coding challenge. The more you look at o1's chain of thought, the more you appreciate r1's detailed chain of thought. It took 50 seconds let's copy the code and test it. It has 6 passes and 3 failures. Let's also give o-1 the error, and see if it can fix it. It seemed to have made a balance calculation error. Let's test the updated code. Okay, now all 9 tests pass. I'll of course be testing these models with a larger codebase side by side. I also heard you in the comments section and will test Roo-Cline and OpenHands. I'm also working on multiple videos on coding with CrewAI agents. Subscribe so you don't miss any comparison.
