**Summary:**

**I. Key Experiences and Feelings:**

    *   He highlights the widespread recognition he gained after the performance.
*  **C. Challenges of Fame:**
    *   He expresses how the years following his spring festival appearance were not smooth, with only 2-3 people out of 10+ noticing him.
   *   He experienced pressure and negativity, with people staring and behaving oddly during his performances.
    *   He compares performing on stage to being like a monkey, enduring constant scrutiny.
    * He explains the toll the pressure took on him with the analogy of wearing heavy costume pieces and having the costume smell like his shoes.

    *   He recounts how people constantly judged his appearance and performances.
    * He illustrates interactions with audiences who may not understand his art.

      * He explains how background, family, life experience all affect one's chances in the entertainment industry.
*   **G. Acceptance of the 'Wild Life' Identity:**
