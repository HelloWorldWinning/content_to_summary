Description:
Okay, here's a summary of the provided text, following your outlined structure:

**1. Outlined Summary:**

*   **I. Introduction:**
    *   The discussion focuses on the deep structure of Chinese culture, specifically the mother-child relationship and its impact on individual development.
    *   The text explores why Chinese culture uses the "motherland as mother" metaphor and why Chinese people are sometimes seen as "giant babies."
*   **II. The Never-Weaned Spirit:**
    *   The text goes beyond the typical father-son dynamic to analyze the mother-child relationship, which is characterized by dependence and a lack of sexual maturity.
    *   Chinese men are often seen as hiding behind their mothers, even in adulthood, illustrating a lack of independent decision-making.
    *   The text contrasts Chinese patriotism (seen as maternal, soft, and emotional) with Japanese patriotism (paternal, aggressive, and militaristic).
    *   Chinese patriotism is likened to a child's admiration for their mother, further linking femininity and childishness.
*   **III. Maternal-Fetal Style and Desexualization:**
    *   The text suggests that Chinese people's return to "maternal-fetal style" in patriotism is a trend of desexualization and childification, where overseas Chinese are viewed as "mothers and babies."
    *   Chinese social circles are often seen as substitutes for the mother's embrace, offering warmth and emotional nourishment.
    *   Patriotism is an emotional need for the comfort of maternal care, not necessarily reasoned.
    *   The standards of "good" behavior for Chinese adults are often extensions of childhood obedience to their mothers, emphasizing conformity over independent thought.
*   **IV. Intergenerational Relationships & Lack of Individuality:**
    *   Chinese culture tends to define individuals through intergenerational relationships, with the other party's definition of self overshadowing one's own.
    *   Chinese individuals are often seen as being in a perpetual "next generation" state.
    *   This lack of individual growth is further manifested through the traditional upbringing, characterized by the severe father and indulgent mother.
    *   Chinese adults do not appear as independent people, often lacking the traits and temperament of independent individuals.
*  **V.  Traditional Chinese Education and its Consequences:**
    *  Traditional Chinese education forces children to memorize concepts they don't understand, which leads to adult children and a lack of personal introspection.
    *   Adults are treated as potentially immoral subjects who need to be constantly monitored, lacking freedom and independence.
    *   Traditional Chinese education cultivates a "heteronomous personality" that is dependent on external guidance.
    *   Children are trained to conform to social needs rather than developing their own individuality.
 *   **VI. Lu Xun's Insight and the Enduring Childhood:**
    *   The text quotes Lu Xun, stating that children are seen as materials for their parents’ blessings, not as future individuals.
    *  The Chinese culture emphasizes a continuous state of childhood before parents, exemplified by the story of Twenty-four Filial Piety
    * The emphasis on heteronomous personality means individuals are seen as immoral and therefore must be controlled by external forces.
    *  The methods of strict fathers are compared to the methods of animal trainers, creating submissive personalities lacking individuality and dignity.
    *  The Chinese tend to be those who make children rather than fathers of people, remaining in a state of perpetual childhood.

**2. Core Point (One Sentence):** Chinese culture fosters a perpetual state of childhood by prioritizing the mother-child dynamic and suppressing individual development, leading to a lack of independent thought and heteronomous personalities.

**3. Fundamental Point (One Sentence):** The deep-rooted maternal-fetal cultural framework in China undermines the development of individual autonomy and self-determination, hindering the formation of truly independent adults.

**4. Overarching Framework:** The content explores how a specific cultural emphasis, the maternal-fetal relationship, shapes individual development within Chinese society. It argues that this emphasis, deeply embedded in family structures, education, and even patriotism, creates a culture where individuals remain in a state of perpetual childhood, lacking independence and self-determination. This is framed through comparisons with other cultures and an analysis of traditional practices.

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en-US Why does Chinese culture compare the country to a mother? Why does it say that Chinese people have a tendency to become giant babies? Today we continue to read the deep structure of Chinese culture. The answers to the above questions are found in today's reading chapter. Today we read about Never Weaning in Spirit and Will Be. If you want to listen to more content on these two topics, Adults and Children, you can subscribe to my YouTube channel. After reading this book, I also read more books on the topic of Chinese culture to help myself kill the Chinese culture virus in my mind. Let’s get started. The spirit has never been weaned. If we only explain the difference in intergenerational relationships between Western culture and Chinese culture through the killing of fathers and sons, we still haven’t made everything clear, because we can’t fully understand each person’s relationship only from the relationship between father and son. Whether a generation has fully grown up must also be observed from the perspective of the mother-child relationship. The Chinese mother-child relationship seems to be premised on the individual's lack of sexual growth and often contains many elements of dependence. When the author was in China, more than one domestic woman told me that they did not Too much attention is paid to domestic men because they tend to hide behind their mothers in everything. Sometimes they don’t even show up during marriage introductions, and their mothers take photos to the park to check each other’s net worth. As for conflicts with their fathers, it’s always the case. He pushed his mother forward and hid behind her. When talking about Chinese patriotism, it reminds people that the Chinese tend to regard the motherland as their mother. Even though the Japanese do not have any common metaphors to describe the motherland, their patriotism seems to be paternal. Most of the elements are because it is aggressive in militarism and is loyal to the emperor, so it is also masculine. In comparison, Chinese patriotism always gives people a soft feeling, that is, the tearful daughter misses her mother like Baiyun's hometown song. The feeling of a daughter missing her mother can even be used to describe the patriotism of Chinese men, and it also reflects the feminine tendency of Chinese men. In fact, femininity and childishness are one and the same. Men in childhood are always the same as women. Generally, men who are delicate and fixed in this form will have a feminine temperament. Therefore, Chinese patriotism is somewhat like a child's admiration for the mother. As for the Chinese who have not grown up sexually, the need for mothers is very clear. The ground is just a feeling of admiration and dependence. Indeed, the Chinese people's return to the maternal-fetal style of the patriotic movement, even if it can make people politicized, does not necessarily mean that the individual content has matured. However, Chinese people living abroad have the tendency to transform the already existing maternal-fetal style. This trend is intensifying. This trend also reflects the tendency of desexualization and childification. Overseas mothers and babies naturally refer to their own circle. In the episode of the Human Magnetic Field program, we have pointed out that the Chinese use oral words. The image used to describe interpersonal relationships also gives it a tendency to be warm or cold. For example, those who are allowed to eat are acquaintances, those who are not allowed to eat are strangers, and acquaintances who are not allowed to eat become lonely or shabby, etc. Therefore, it can be seen that the Chinese have The tendency of treating human feelings or one's own circle as a substitute for the mother's embrace in childhood. Firstly, it is as warm as a mother's womb. Secondly, it is like a loving mother's embrace from which individuals can draw nutrients. This ultimately involves the Chinese people's need to Therefore, the patriotic movement of overseas students is basically a call from the mother and the womb. It is indeed different from movements around the world. The Chinese people's love for the motherland is almost purely expressed as a feeling of admiration, with little theory or rationality and no influence from others. Most of the people do this without thinking, but because they are being cared for by others. As for those who want to attract the masses, they use the method of helping each other to settle down, that is, caring about the lives of the masses to make them get to know each other. Chinese men and women still have the appearance of their mother's good daughters when they reach adulthood. In other words, they are not like a self-proclaimed independent man or woman, but always bear the mark of the next generation. This does not necessarily mean that they are completely dependent on their mother for details of life, but it means that this good behavior is an expansion. It is a category with social significance that is determined by the social masses to determine the standard of good or bad of a person. Most of its content is not smoking, not drinking, not having premarital sex, people are good and very regular, etc. When examining other virtues, The origin is still the continuation of the obedient attitude towards the mother in childhood when she told her mother to ensure her health and be honest. Therefore, the basis of personal conscience basically does not come from a transcendent principle above the world, but from the childhood stage. The infinite extension of the restriction between two people. Chinese culture’s design for people is that one person is defined by two people. Therefore, in the intergenerational relationship, the other party’s content overwhelms one’s own content. The other party’s definition of oneself is more than one’s own definition of oneself. This results in It is natural for individuals to be in the eternal state of the next generation. Therefore, compared with Westerners, Chinese teenagers, whether they are boys or girls, are less likely to have the appearance, body, and temperament that a male or female should have as an independent unit, let alone It's charming. The growth problems of the Chinese people cannot be solved simply by changing from killing children to killing fathers. It seems that the Chinese must also abort the fetus. This is the maternal-fetal culture that treats adults as children. A French educator believes that the Chinese have the tendency to treat children. The tendency to treat adults as children is indeed true under traditional education. When children are still very young, they are required to read books by sages. Of course, these books can only be understood by adults. Therefore, children are required to memorize them first. However, when When a person grows up, he is treated as an immoral subject and is monitored everywhere. He does not even have the freedom to choose marriage, so he is basically still regarded as a child who cannot control himself. When a Chinese person grows up, he is never Various arrangements strongly imply that he is a person without independent judgment, so he must be guarded against like a civilian or a river. Basically, he is regarded as a child whose sexuality has not yet sprouted, so even falling in love is difficult. In addition, blocking also cultivates people to see people and things in a typified way rather than in an individualized and in-depth way. Therefore, in novels and movies for adults, black and white are always made clear. You can know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are from the beginning. This can be saved. Children under the age of ten often ask their parents questions at the beginning of the movie. Asking children to absorb things beyond their understanding only paves the way for the future of adult children. This method of imposing external forces is precisely to cultivate a personality that controls and rules others. In other words, don't let the introspective self-base appear. As for the traditional Chinese family education, it also goes in the same direction. The ideal standard that the Chinese require parents to achieve is a strict father and a loving mother. Therefore, the role of the mother must be kind to the children. Permissive, while the father's role must be severe and intimidating to his children. Generally speaking, before the age of five or six, children spend their time under the indulgence of a loving mother. After the age of five or six, they are under the discipline of a strict father. Therefore, in The upbringing and education here seems to be a formal division of labor. However, no matter who is shaping it, it is not developing in the direction of individual personality growth. In China's culture without individual souls, each generation trains the personality of the next generation to conform to the needs of the two. Human personality in relationships must be human in front of others. Therefore, it is also a heteronomous personality. Since individuals cannot appear, everyone's intention in life is concentrated on the same physical needs of everyone, so as to obtain beyond their own physical needs. The main content of life is to care for others' daily life and food. The Chinese people's united front method is to use the method of caring about the lives of the masses to make each other heart-to-heart. Therefore, the Chinese people's realm of great harmony can only be based on being close to the people. The authoritarian Chinese's emotional training of their children does not prepare them to be independent, but makes them permanently attached to themselves. Therefore, they continue indefinitely this physical stage of satisfying oral desires, that is, they always treat it as a child. Even if a person reaches the age of thirty or forty, in the eyes of a loving mother, he will always be regarded as a baby who must be stuffed with food rather than as an adult whose sexuality has sprouted. On the one hand, the previous generation has always adopted a secretive attitude. Therefore, Chinese people have developed a serious desexualization tendency in terms of thoughts, feelings, and body. This style of always treating children as babies can be described as Lu Xun In a paragraph, it is commented that all children are just materials for their parents' blessings, not the buds of future people. The story of the Twenty-four Filial Piety, Lao Lai and Parents, clearly expresses the state of a person's eternal childhood in front of his parents. What Chinese culture pays attention to is cultivating. A heteronomous and heteronomous personality must therefore treat each individual as an immoral subject rather than a subject of conscience or rights who make self-determination in an introspective way, and therefore does not train each individual to use choice or To accept the norms of society in a critical way, he must be subdued by external force like a beast. In order to complete such a task, Yan's father It is necessary to use intimidation methods or even to beat. Even if a person's temperament is not strict, he must put on such a face in front of his children, otherwise he will be considered to have harmed the next generation. Strict fathers use the method of taming animals to educate. Therefore, when children are beaten and scolded by their children, they often call them beasts. However, if the trainer's electric whip cannot remove the last remaining bit of animality in lions and tigers, then this kind of heterogeneity of the Chinese people In addition to creating a submissive attitude without individuality and dignity in the main content of personality, the heteronomous method cannot promote the last bit of selfishness of people, just like under the nationalized system where the world is for the public, private land can never be eradicated. Chinese people are always kept in a state of childhood where he rules and rules others. Lu Xun said it well. Chinese people are usually the ones who make children, not the fathers of people. After giving birth to children, they are still not the bud of people.
