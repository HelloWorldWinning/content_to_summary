### **Summary**

**I. Introduction**

*   This video course provides a complete guide to the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator.
*   It is designed for traders of all levels, from beginners to advanced.
*   The course covers the basics, uses, and advanced strategies of the MACD.

**II. Basics of the MACD Indicator**

*   **Definition:** MACD is used to identify trends and momentum of the price.
*   **Components:**
    *   **MACD Line:** Calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA.
    *   **Signal Line:** A 9-period EMA of the MACD line, used for crossover signals.
    *   **Histogram:** Represents the difference between the MACD line and the signal line, indicating momentum.
    *   Histogram's Green bars above zero line: Price is in an uptrend.
    *   Histogram's Red bars below zero line: Price is in a downtrend.

**III. Uses of the MACD Indicator**

*   **Histogram Slope:**
    *   Expanding histogram: growing momentum, enter in trend direction.
    *   Shrinking histogram: weakening momentum, exit trades.
    *   Dark bars: expanding histogram.
    *   Light bars: shrinking histogram.
*   **Crossovers:**
    *   MACD line crossing the signal line can give early signs of reversal and better entries compared to moving average crossovers.
    *   Crossovers generate more false signals, not used in isolation.
*   **Zero Line Crossovers:**
    *   MACD line crossing above zero: uptrend momentum.
    *   MACD line crossing below zero: downtrend momentum.
    *   Fewer false signals but needs more confirmation.
*   **Zero Line Pullbacks:**
    *   MACD line pulls back to zero line in a strong trend and bounces.
    *   Wait for macd cross above signal line to buy, macd cross below signal line to sell.
*   **Divergences:**
    *   Price and MACD move in opposite directions, a sign of reversal.
    *   **Bullish Divergence:** Price makes a lower low, MACD makes a higher low, sign of sellers weakening.
    *   **Bearish Divergence:** Price makes a higher high, MACD makes a lower high, sign of buyers weakening.
    *  Look for clear and obvious divergences

**IV. Advanced MACD Trading Strategies**

*   **Strategy 1: Divergence + Support & Resistance:**
    *   Identify support/resistance on higher time frames, then wait for divergence on lower time frames near those levels.
    *   Enter trades when the histogram breaks above/below the line created between macd tops/bottoms.
*   **Strategy 2: Divergence + Bollinger Bands:**
    *   Use 200-period Bollinger Bands.
    *   Look for divergence when price moves outside the bands.
    *   Enter on first candle closing inside the bands.
*   **Strategy 3: EMA Bands + Zero Line Pullbacks**
    *   Use EMA ribbon indicator with 3 x 200 EMAs (highs, close, lows) as dynamic support/resistance bands.
    *   Wait for price pullback to EMA band, macd cross zero line.
    *   Create short-term trend line on pullback and enter on breakout.
*   **Strategy 4: Swap Zones + Zero Line Pullbacks**
    *   Identify swap zones, where previous resistance turns into support and vice versa.
    *   Wait for price pullback to swap zones, macd zero line cross over.
    *   Enter on candlestick patterns such as Doji, evening star.

**V. Conclusion**

*   The video covered the uses of MACD, then delved into advanced strategies using macd.
*   Encourages viewers to comment and suggest topics.

**Core Point:**  The MACD indicator can be used in various ways to identify trading opportunities by analyzing its components, crossovers, divergences, and zero line pullbacks.

**Fundamental Point:** Combining the MACD indicator with other technical analysis tools, like support/resistance, Bollinger Bands, or trend lines, can create more robust and effective trading strategies.

**Overarching Framework:** The content follows a logical structure, starting with the basic definition and components of the MACD indicator, progressing to its various applications, and finally combining the indicator with other concepts to create advanced trading strategies for different market conditions.

prove this I have plotted the 12 and align: start position: 0% to prove this I have plotted the 12 and 26 EMAs on the chart along with the macd align: start position: 0% 26 EMAs on the chart along with the macd align: start position: 0% 26 EMAs on the chart along with the macd as you already know the macd is align: start position: 0% as you already know the macd is align: start position: 0% as you already know the macd is calculated on the 12 and 26 EMA so this align: start position: 0% calculated on the 12 and 26 EMA so this align: start position: 0% calculated on the 12 and 26 EMA so this should be a fair comparison align: start position: 0% should be a fair comparison align: start position: 0% should be a fair comparison here is the reversal point align: start position: 0% here is the reversal point align: start position: 0% here is the reversal point from this point the price reversed from align: start position: 0% from this point the price reversed from align: start position: 0% from this point the price reversed from an uptrend to a downtrend align: start position: 0% an uptrend to a downtrend align: start position: 0% an uptrend to a downtrend the crossover for the moving

start position: 0% occurred here so your entry would be on this candle align: start position: 0% so your entry would be on this candle align: start position: 0% so your entry would be on this candle as you can see the price had already align: start position: 0% as you can see the price had already align: start position: 0% as you can see the price had already moved quite some distance before giving align: start position: 0% moved quite some distance before giving align: start position: 0% moved quite some distance before giving the crossover signal align: start position: 0% the crossover signal align: start position: 0% the crossover signal so ideally your stop loss would be above align: start position: 0% so ideally your stop loss would be above align: start position: 0% so ideally your stop loss would be above this High which is quite a wide stop align: start position: 0% this High which is quite a wide stop align: start position: 0% this High which is quite a wide stop loss align: start position: 0% loss align: start position: 0% loss but if you look at the macd your entry align: start position: 0% but if you look at the macd your entry align: start position: 0% but if you look at the macd your entry signal would be on this candle as the align: start position: 0% signal would be on this candle as the align: start position: 0% signal would be on this candle as the macd line crossed below the signal line align: start position: 0% macd line crossed below the signal line align: start position: 0% macd line crossed below the signal line it gives you a far superior entry price align: start position: 0% it gives you a far superior entry price align: start position: 0% it gives you a far superior entry price with a tight stop loss as a result you align: start position: 0% with a tight stop loss as a result you align: start position: 0% with a tight stop loss as a result you capture a bigger portion of the price align: start position: 0% capture a bigger portion of the price align: start position: 0% capture a bigger portion of the price move align: start position: 0% move align: start position: 0% move here is another example we can see that align: start position: 0% here is another example we can see that align: start position: 0% here is another example we can see that the 12 EMA crossed above the 26 EMA on align: start position: 0% the 12 EMA crossed above the 26 EMA on align: start position: 0% the 12 EMA crossed above the 26 EMA on this candle it is a bullish crossover so align: start position: 0% this candle it is a bullish crossover so align: start position: 0% this candle it is a bullish crossover so a buy entry occurs here align: start position: 0% a buy entry occurs here align: start position: 0% a buy entry occurs here but the crossover happens only after the align: start position: 0% but the crossover happens only after the align: start position: 0% but the crossover happens only after the price has moved a certain

position: 0% macd crossovers can be an early sign of reversal but they generate far more align: start position: 0% reversal but they generate far more align: start position: 0% reversal but they generate far more false signals so we can't use these align: start position: 0% false signals so we can't use these align: start position: 0% false signals so we can't use these crossovers in isolation a more confirmed align: start position: 0% crossovers in isolation a more confirmed align: start position: 0% crossovers in isolation a more confirmed signal is the zero line crossover align: start position: 0% signal is the zero line crossover align: start position: 0% signal is the zero line crossover foreign align: start position: 0% foreign align: start position: 0% foreign use three zero line crossover align: start position: 0% use three zero line crossover align: start position: 0% use three zero line crossover the macd consists of a zero line which align: start position: 0% the macd consists of a zero line which align: start position: 0% the macd consists of a zero line which is known as the midpoint of the align: start position: 0% is known as the midpoint of the align: start position: 0% is known as the midpoint of the indicator when the 12 EMA crosses below align: start position: 0% indicator when the 12 EMA crosses below align: start position: 0% indicator when the 12 EMA crosses below the 26 EMA the macd line moves below the align: start position: 0% the 26 EMA the macd line moves below the align: start position: 0% the 26 EMA the macd line moves below the zero line align: start position: 0% zero line align: start position: 0% zero line this shows that the trend and momentum align: start position: 0% this shows that the trend and momentum align: start position: 0% this shows that the trend and momentum have shifted downwards and a downtrend align: start position: 0% have shifted downwards and a downtrend align: start position: 0% have shifted downwards and a downtrend may start align: start position: 0% may start align: start position: 0% may start similarly when the 12 EMA crosses above align: start position: 0% similarly when the 12 EMA crosses above align: start position: 0% similarly when the 12 EMA crosses above the 26 EMA the macd line moves above the align: start position: 0% the 26 EMA the macd line moves above the align: start

this shows that the trend and momentum align: start position: 0% this shows that the trend and momentum have shifted upwards and the price may align: start position: 0% have shifted upwards and the price may align: start position: 0% have shifted upwards and the price may start an uptrend now align: start position: 0% start an uptrend now align: start position: 0% start an uptrend now the zero line crossovers give fewer align: start position: 0% the zero line crossovers give fewer align: start position: 0% the zero line crossovers give fewer false signals but again we need to add align: start position: 0% false signals but again we need to add align: start position: 0% false signals but again we need to add more confirmations for them to be high align: start position: 0% more confirmations for them to be high align: start position: 0% more confirmations for them to be high probability trades align: start position: 0% align: start position: 0% use 4 zero line pullbacks align: start position: 0% use 4 zero line pullbacks align: start position: 0% use 4 zero line pullbacks in strong trending markets the macd line align: start position: 0% in strong trending markets the macd line align: start position: 0% in strong trending markets the macd line will often pull back to the zero line align: start position: 0% will often pull back to the zero line align: start position: 0% will often pull back to the zero line and the price will bounce back align: start position: 0% and the price will bounce back align: start position: 0% and the price will bounce back so in an uptrend if the macd line pulls align: start position: 0% so in an uptrend if the macd line pulls align: start position: 0% so in an uptrend if the macd line pulls back to the zero line it is a good place align: start position: 0% back to the zero line it is a good place align: start position: 0% back to the zero line it is a good place to make buy trades but again we cannot align: start

position: 0% move it is a sign that the sellers are tired align: start position: 0% it is a sign that the sellers are tired align: start position: 0% it is a sign that the sellers are tired and the price will likely stall or align: start position: 0% and the price will likely stall or align: start position: 0% and the price will likely stall or reverse align: start position: 0% reverse align: start position: 0% reverse here is an example align: start position: 0% here is an example align: start position: 0% here is an example here the price was in a downtrend the align: start position: 0% here the price was in a downtrend the align: start position: 0% here the price was in a downtrend the price created these three lower lows align: start position: 0% price created these three lower lows align: start position: 0% price created these three lower lows each low being lower than the previous align: start position: 0% each low being lower than the previous align: start position: 0% each low being lower than the previous one align: start position: 0% one align: start position: 0% one however the macd makes higher lows this align: start position: 0% however the macd makes higher lows this align: start position: 0% however the macd makes higher lows this is a clear Divergence it shows that the align: start position: 0% is a clear Divergence it shows that the align: start position: 0% is a clear Divergence it shows that the sellers are losing their strength and a align: start position: 0% sellers are losing their strength and a align: start position: 0% sellers are losing their strength and a reversal may occur so this becomes a align: start position: 0% reversal may occur so this becomes a align: start position: 0% reversal may occur so this becomes a good Buy

we see lower highs this is a clear align: start position: 0% macd we see lower highs this is a clear align: start position: 0% macd we see lower highs this is a clear bearish Divergence it is a sign that the align: start position: 0% bearish Divergence it is a sign that the align: start position: 0% bearish Divergence it is a sign that the buyers are losing momentum and strength align: start

avoid align: start position: 0% so the best thing to do here is to avoid align: start position: 0% so the best thing to do here is to avoid such divergences align: start position: 0% such divergences align: start position: 0% such divergences on the other hand this was a clear align: start position: 0% on the other hand this was a clear align: start position: 0% on the other hand this was a clear Divergence align: start position: 0% Divergence align: start position: 0% Divergence the price makes higher Highs but the align: start position: 0% the price makes higher Highs but the align: start

we should look for these types of divergences align: start position: 0% for these types of divergences align: start position: 0% for these types of divergences divergences that are obvious to the eye align: start position: 0% divergences that are obvious to the eye align: start position: 0% divergences that are obvious to the eye can be very powerful so these were the align: start position: 0% can be very powerful so these were the align: start position: 0% can be very powerful so these were the five uses of the macd indicator align: start position: 0% five uses of the macd indicator align: start position: 0% five uses of the macd indicator now let's discuss the strategies that align: start position: 0% now let's discuss the strategies that align: start position: 0% now let's discuss the strategies that can be created around the macd indicator align: start position: 0% can be created around the macd indicator align: start position: 0% can be created around the macd indicator the first

align: start position: 0% strategy one Divergence plus support and resistance align: start position: 0% Divergence plus support and resistance align: start position: 0% Divergence plus support and resistance as we already discussed Divergence is a align: start position: 0% as we already discussed Divergence is a align: start position: 0% as we already discussed Divergence is a strong sign of reversal but we cannot align: start position: 0% strong sign of reversal but we cannot align: start position: 0% strong sign of reversal but we cannot trade every Divergence align: start position: 0% trade every Divergence align: start position: 0% trade every Divergence we need to identify potential reversal align: start position: 0% we need to identify potential reversal align: start position: 0% we need to identify potential reversal areas and wait for the macd to create align: start position: 0% areas and wait for the macd to create align: start position: 0% areas and wait for the macd to create Divergence around those areas align: start position: 0% Divergence around those areas align: start position: 0% Divergence around those areas for this we will use the concepts of align: start position: 0% for this we will use the concepts of align: start position: 0% for this we will use the concepts of support and resistance align: start position: 0% support and resistance align: start position: 0% support and resistance we will first identify the support and align: start position: 0% we will first identify the support and align: start position: 0% we will first identify the support and resistance levels on a higher time frame align: start position: 0% resistance levels on a higher time frame align: start position: 0% resistance levels on a higher time frame then wait for Divergence on a lower time align: start position: 0% then wait for Divergence on a lower time align: start position: 0% then wait for Divergence on a lower time frame align: start position: 0% frame align: start position: 0% frame here is an example align: start position: 0% here is an example align: start position: 0% here is an example we have the GBP USD pair on the four align: start position: 0% we have the GBP USD pair on the four align: start position: 0% we have the GBP USD pair on the four hour chart align: start position: 0% hour chart align: start position: 0% hour chart the price made an up move and then align: start position: 0% the price made an up move and then align: start position: 0% the price made an up move and then reversed so we plot a level of align: start position: 0% reversed so we plot a level of align: start position: 0% reversed so we plot a level of resistance here align: start position: 0% resistance here align: start position: 0% resistance here when the price arrives near the align: start position: 0% when the price arrives near the align: start position: 0% when the price arrives near the resistance for the second time we expect align: start position: 0% resistance for the second time we expect align: start position: 0% resistance for the second time we expect the price to reverse downwards again align: start position: 0% the price to reverse downwards again align: start position: 0% the price to reverse downwards again so we switch to a one hour chart to look align: start position: 0% so we switch to a one hour chart to look align: start position: 0% so we switch to a one hour chart to look for Divergence align: start position: 0% for Divergence align: start position: 0% for Divergence here is the same price action on a one align: start position: 0% here is the same price action on a one align: start position: 0% here is the same price action on a one hour chart align: start position: 0% hour chart align: start position: 0% hour chart we see that the price made a higher high align: start position: 0% we see that the price made a higher high align: start position: 0% we see that the price made a higher high coming into the resistance level align: start position: 0% coming into the resistance level align: start position: 0% coming into the resistance level but on the macd we see lower highs align: start position: 0% but on the macd we see lower highs align: start position: 0% but on the macd we see lower highs this is a clear and obvious bearish align: start position: 0% this is a clear and obvious bearish align: start position: 0% this is a clear and obvious bearish Divergence align: start position: 0% Divergence align: start position: 0% Divergence it tells us that the buyers have lost align: start position: 0% it tells us that the buyers have lost align: start position: 0% it tells us that the buyers have lost momentum coming into the resistance align: start position: 0% momentum coming into the resistance align: start position: 0% momentum coming into the resistance we have a Confluence of a resistance align: start position: 0% we have a Confluence of a resistance align: start position: 0% we have a Confluence of a resistance level with Divergence align: start position: 0% level with Divergence align: start position: 0% level with Divergence this is a high probability trade align: start position: 0% this is a high probability trade align: start position: 0% this is a high probability trade therefore we should look out for a sell align: start position: 0% therefore we should look out for a sell align: start position: 0% therefore we should look out for a sell trade align: start position: 0% trade align: start position: 0% trade for our entry we need to identify the align: start position: 0% for our entry we need to identify the align: start position: 0% for our entry we need to identify the lowest point between the tops on the align: start position: 0% lowest point between the tops on the align: start position: 0% lowest point between the tops on the macd align: start position: 0% macd align: start position: 0% macd these are the two tops align: start position: 0% these are the two tops align: start position: 0% these are the two tops here is the lowest point between them we align: start position: 0% here is the lowest point between them we align: start position: 0% here is the lowest point between them we draw a line at that bar align: start position: 0% draw a line at that bar align: start position: 0% draw a line at that bar then we wait for the histogram to break align: start position: 0% then we wait for the histogram to break align: start position: 0% then we wait for the histogram to break below that line align: start position: 0% below that line align: start position: 0% below that line on this bar the histogram breaks below align: start position: 0% on this bar the histogram breaks below align: start position: 0% on this bar the histogram breaks below the line align: start position: 0% the line align: start position: 0% the line so we enter a sell trade on the align: start position: 0% so we enter a sell trade on the align: start position: 0% so we enter a sell trade on the corresponding candle align: start position: 0% corresponding candle align: start position: 0% corresponding candle as you can see we saw a

entry align: start position: 0% after our entry here is an example of a buy setup align: start position: 0% here is an example of a buy setup align: start position: 0% here is an example of a buy setup we have the USD JPY on a four hour chart align: start position: 0% we have the USD JPY on a four hour chart align: start position: 0% we have the USD JPY on a four hour chart this upside reversal helped us identify align: start position: 0% this upside reversal helped us identify align: start position: 0% this upside reversal helped us identify this support level align: start position: 0% this support level align: start position: 0% this support level when the price returns to this level we align: start position: 0% when the price returns to this level we align: start position: 0% when the price returns to this level we expect the price to find support and align: start position: 0% expect the price to find support and align: start position: 0% expect the price to find support and move upwards align: start position: 0% move upwards align: start position: 0% move upwards so we switch to a one hour time frame align: start position: 0% so we switch to a one hour time frame align: start position: 0% so we switch to a one hour time frame and look for a bullish Divergence align: start position: 0% and look for a bullish Divergence align: start position: 0% and look for a bullish Divergence the price makes a lower low coming into align: start position: 0% the price makes a lower low coming into align: start position: 0% the price makes a lower low coming into the support Zone align: start position: 0% the support Zone align: start position: 0% the support Zone but on the macd we see a higher low align: start position: 0% but on the macd we see a higher low align: start position: 0% but on the macd we see a higher low this is a clear and obvious Divergence align: start position: 0% this is a clear and obvious Divergence align: start position: 0% this is a clear and obvious Divergence it shows us that the sellers have lost align: start position: 0% it shows us that the sellers have lost align: start position: 0% it shows us that the sellers have lost their strength and momentum in this down align: start position: 0% their strength and momentum in this down align: start position: 0% their strength and momentum in this down move so we identify this as a high align: start position: 0% move so we identify this as a high align: start position: 0% move so we identify this as a high probability trade setup align: start position: 0% probability trade setup align: start position: 0% probability trade setup now we Mark the highest point between align: start position: 0% now we Mark the highest point between align: start position: 0% now we Mark the highest point between the bottoms on the macd and draw a line align: start position: 0% the bottoms on the macd and draw a line align: start position: 0% the bottoms on the macd and draw a line on this bar the histogram breaks above align: start position: 0% on this bar the histogram breaks above align: start position: 0% on this bar the histogram breaks above the line and it is a Buy Signal so we align: start position: 0% the line and it is a Buy Signal so we align: start position: 0% the line and it is a Buy Signal so we buy here align: start position: 0% buy here align: start position: 0% buy here as you can see the price made an up move align: start position: 0% as you can see the price made an up move align: start position: 0% as you can see the price made an up move and touched the most recent highs align: start position: 0% and touched the most recent highs align: start position: 0% and touched the most recent highs so this is how to use the Divergence align: start position: 0% so this is how to use the Divergence align: start position: 0% so this is how to use the Divergence with concepts of support and resistance align: start position: 0% with concepts of support and resistance align: start position: 0% with concepts of support and resistance now let's look at the second strategy align: start position: 0% now let's look at the second strategy align: start position: 0% now let's look at the second strategy strategy two Divergence plus Bollinger align: start position: 0% strategy two Divergence plus Bollinger align: start position: 0% strategy two Divergence plus Bollinger Bands align: start position: 0% Bands align: start position: 0% Bands Bollinger Bands are a very popular align: start position: 0% Bollinger Bands are a very popular align: start position: 0% Bollinger Bands are a very popular indicator that Traders use to trade align: start position: 0% indicator that Traders use to trade align: start position: 0% indicator that Traders use to trade reversals align: start position: 0% reversals align: start position: 0% reversals the theory is this align: start position: 0% the theory is this align: start position: 0% the theory is this ninety percent of the time the price is align: start position: 0% ninety percent of the time the price is align: start position: 0% ninety percent of the time the price is expected to stay Within These bands align: start position: 0% expected to stay Within These bands align: start position: 0% expected to stay Within These bands so whenever the price moves outside the align: start position: 0% so whenever the price moves outside the align: start position: 0% so whenever the price moves outside the bands we can expect the price to reverse align: start position: 0% bands we can expect the price to reverse align: start position: 0% bands we can expect the price to reverse and return inside align: start position: 0% and return inside align: start position: 0% and return inside if the price moves above the upper band align: start position: 0% if the price moves above the upper band align: start position: 0% if the price moves above the upper band we expect it to reverse downwards align: start position: 0% we expect it to reverse downwards align: start position: 0% we expect it to reverse downwards similarly if the price moves below the align: start position: 0% similarly if the price moves below the align: start position: 0% similarly if the price moves below the lower band we expect the price to align: start position: 0% lower band we expect the price to align: start position: 0% lower band we expect the price to reverse upwards align: start position: 0% reverse upwards align: start position: 0% reverse upwards we will combine this analogy with the align: start position: 0% we will combine this analogy with the align: start position: 0% we will combine this analogy with the macd Divergence align: start position: 0% macd Divergence align: start position: 0% macd Divergence but first we will go over the Bollinger align: start position: 0% but first we will go over the Bollinger align: start position: 0% but first we will go over the Bollinger band settings and change the length to align: start position: 0% band settings and change the length to align: start position: 0% band settings and change the length to 200. we will keep the standard deviation align: start position: 0% 200. we will keep the standard deviation align: start position: 0% 200. we will keep the standard deviation to two align: start position: 0% to two align: start position: 0% to two this gives Bollinger Bands on the 200 align: start position: 0% this gives Bollinger Bands on the 200 align: start position: 0% this gives Bollinger Bands on the 200 moving average align: start position: 0% moving average align: start position: 0% moving average here is a cell setup using this strategy align: start position: 0% here is a cell setup using this strategy align: start position: 0% here is a cell setup using this strategy here we see that the price was in an align: start position: 0% here we see that the price was in an align: start position: 0% here we see that the price was in an uptrend align: start position: 0% uptrend align: start position: 0% uptrend the trend was so strong that the price align: start position: 0% the trend was so strong that the price align: start position: 0% the trend was so strong that the price stayed above the upper Bollinger band align: start position: 0% stayed above the upper Bollinger band align: start position: 0% stayed above the upper Bollinger band for an extended period align: start position: 0% for an extended period align: start position: 0% for an extended period now we expect the price to move lower align: start position: 0% now we expect the price to move lower align: start position: 0% now we expect the price to move lower so we look for a bearish Divergence align: start position: 0% so we look for a bearish Divergence align: start position: 0% so we look for a bearish Divergence here the price made a higher high but align: start position: 0% here the price made a higher high but align: start position: 0% here the price made a higher high but the macd histogram made a lower high align: start position: 0% the macd histogram made a lower high align: start position: 0% the macd histogram made a lower high in fact on the second top we don't even align: start position: 0% in fact on the second top we don't even align: start position: 0% in fact on the second top we don't even see a green bar align: start position: 0% see a green bar align: start position: 0% see a green bar this is a great sign that the sellers align: start position: 0% this is a great sign that the sellers align: start position: 0% this is a great sign that the sellers have grabbed hold of the markets and the align: start position: 0% have grabbed hold of the markets and the align: start position: 0% have grabbed hold of the markets and the price will follow soon so a selling align: start position: 0% price will follow soon so a selling align: start position: 0% price will follow soon so a selling opportunity presents itself align: start position: 0% opportunity presents itself align: start position: 0% opportunity presents itself for this strategy our entry occurs on align: start position: 0% for this strategy our entry occurs on align: start position: 0% for this strategy our entry occurs on the first candle that closes back inside align: start position: 0% the first candle that closes back inside align: start position: 0% the first candle that closes back inside the Bands align: start position: 0% the Bands align: start position: 0% the Bands so this will be our entry candle align: start position: 0% so this will be our entry candle align: start position: 0% so this will be our entry candle and as you can see the price made a align: start position: 0% and as you can see the price made a align: start position: 0% and as you can see the price made a solid down move after our entry align: start position: 0% align: start position: 0% moving on to buy trade align: start position: 0% moving on to buy trade align: start position: 0% moving on to buy trade initially we saw a massive down move align: start position: 0% initially we saw a massive down move align: start position: 0% initially we saw a massive down move that stayed below the lower band align: start position: 0% that stayed below the lower band align: start position: 0% that stayed below the lower band the price spends a lot of time below the align: start position: 0% the price spends a lot of time below the align: start position: 0% the price spends a lot of time below the band we know that the price cannot spend align: start position: 0% band we know that the price cannot spend align: start position: 0% band we know that the price cannot spend so much time outside the bands so we are align: start position: 0% so much time outside the bands so we are align: start position: 0% so much time outside the bands so we are already expecting a reversal to the align: start position: 0% already expecting a reversal to the align: start position: 0% already expecting a reversal to the upside align: start position: 0% upside align: start position: 0% upside towards the end of the move we see the align: start position: 0% towards the end of the move we see the align: start position: 0% towards the end of the move we see the price was constantly making lower lows align: start position: 0% price was constantly making lower lows align: start position: 0% price was constantly making lower lows but the macd histogram was plotting align: start position: 0% but the macd histogram was plotting align: start position: 0% but the macd histogram was plotting higher lows this was a clear and obvious align: start position: 0% higher lows this was a clear and obvious align: start position: 0% higher lows this was a clear and obvious Divergence we have a combination of the align: start position: 0% Divergence we have a combination of the align: start position: 0% Divergence we have a combination of the Bollinger Bands and the macd Divergence align: start position: 0% Bollinger Bands and the macd Divergence align: start position: 0% Bollinger Bands and the macd Divergence it indicates that the sellers have lost align: start position: 0% it indicates that the sellers have lost align: start position: 0% it indicates that the sellers have lost all momentum coming into the down move align: start position: 0% all momentum coming into the down move align: start position: 0% all momentum coming into the down move the buyers are pushing hard and an align: start position: 0% the buyers are pushing hard and an align: start position: 0% the buyers are pushing hard and an upwards reversal may occur soon align: start position: 0% upwards reversal may occur soon align: start position: 0% upwards reversal may occur soon so we should look for a Buy trade align: start position: 0% so we should look for a Buy trade align: start position: 0% so we should look for a Buy trade our buy entry occurs as the price closes align: start position: 0% our buy entry occurs as the price closes align: start position: 0% our buy entry occurs as the price closes above the lower band on this candle align: start position: 0% above the lower band on this candle align: start position: 0% above the lower band on this candle as you can see the price shot up after align: start position: 0% as you can see the price shot up after align: start position: 0% as you can see the price shot up after our entry align: start position: 0% our entry align: start position: 0% our entry so this was a unique way of trading macd align: start position: 0% so this was a unique way of trading macd align: start position: 0% so this was a unique way of trading macd Divergence with Bollinger Bands align: start position: 0% Divergence with Bollinger Bands align: start position: 0% Divergence with Bollinger Bands now moving on to the trend trading align: start
