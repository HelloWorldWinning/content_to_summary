Description:
Okay, here's a structured summary of the provided content:

**I. Core Concepts and Trading Strategy**

*   **A. Primary Indicator:** The strategy revolves around a modified Stochastic RSI indicator.
    *   **1.**  **RSI Color:** RSI line changes color: green for above 50, red for below 50, signaling potential long and short setups, respectively.
    *   **2.**  **Stochastic Crossovers:** Stochastic is used for entry signals, focusing on crossovers in extreme zones (20-30 for longs, 70-80 for shorts).
    *   **3.**  **Custom Settings**: Adjusting the smoothing K and D values and the upper and lower levels for the stochastic.
*   **B. Trade Entry:**
    *   **1.** Long setup: Green RSI with Stochastic crossover in the lower extreme zone.
    *   **2.** Short setup: Red RSI with Stochastic crossover in the upper extreme zone.
*   **C. Risk Management:**
    *   **1.** Stop-loss: Placed at the recent swing low (for longs) or high (for shorts).
    *   **2.** Take Profit: Aim for a 1.5:1 risk-reward ratio.

**II. Enhancements and Favorite Setups**

*   **A. Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs):**
    *   **1.** EMA Cloud: Using multiple EMAs (21, 55, 100, 150) to identify trending markets and support/resistance levels.
    *   **2.**  Trade Confirmation: EMAs should be aligned in the direction of the intended trade, along with other signals.
*   **B. Divergence:**
    *   **1.**  Definition:  Price making lower highs/lows while Stochastic is making higher highs/lows, indicating a potential trend reversal.
    *   **2.**  Trade Execution: Enter on Stochastic crossover, not waiting for RSI confirmation if desired.
*  **C. Retest Cloud**
    *   **1.**  Definition: Price retracing to previously crossed EMAs
    *   **2.** Trade Execution: Enter when price bounces off the retest area with stochastic crossing.

**III. Key Conclusions**

*   **Core Point:** The presented trading strategy combines a modified Stochastic RSI with EMA analysis and divergence/retest setups to identify high-probability trading opportunities.
*   **Fundamental Point:** The strategy emphasizes confluence of multiple signals (RSI, Stochastic, EMAs, divergence) and strong risk management principles to enhance trading performance.

**IV. Overarching Framework:**

The content presents a specific technical analysis strategy that utilizes a combination of indicators and price action to identify trading setups and manage risk. It is a systematic approach that seeks to increase trading profitability by using specific criteria for trade entry, stop losses, and take profit levels.

let's have a look at the RSI RSI align: start position: 0% first let's have a look at the RSI RSI changes color based on the value it has align: start position: 0% changes color based on the value it has align: start position: 0% changes color based on the value it has if the RSI value is below 50 it turns align: start position: 0% if the RSI value is below 50 it turns align: start position: 0% if the RSI value is below 50 it turns red and if it's about 50 it turns green align: start position: 0% red and if it's about 50 it turns green align: start position: 0% red and if it's about 50 it turns green that's a really cool feature and super align: start position: 0% that's a really cool feature and super align: start position: 0% that's a really cool feature and super helpful to spot a better trading setups align: start position: 0% helpful to spot a better trading setups align: start position: 0% helpful to spot a better trading setups if we looking to take a trade we will align: start position: 0% if we looking to take a trade we will align: start position: 0% if we looking to take a trade we will look for long setups if the RSI is green align: start position: 0% look for long setups if the RSI is green align: start position: 0% look for long setups if the RSI is green and for short setups if the RSI is red align: start position: 0% and for short setups if the RSI is red align: start position: 0% and for short setups if the RSI is red pretty simple now stochastic is momentum align: start position: 0% pretty simple now stochastic is momentum align: start position: 0% pretty simple now stochastic is momentum indicator and that will be extremely align: start position: 0% indicator and that will be extremely align: start position: 0% indicator and that will be extremely helpful for entry signal the signal we align: start position: 0% helpful for entry signal the signal we align: start position: 0% helpful for entry signal the signal we are looking for will be IND those align: start position: 0% are looking for will be IND those align: start position: 0% are looking for will be IND those extreme areas I mentioned earlier for align: start position: 0% extreme areas I mentioned earlier for align: start position: 0% extreme areas I mentioned earlier for Longs we want to see the crossover in 30 align: start position: 0% Longs we want to see the crossover in 30 align: start position: 0% Longs we want to see the crossover in 30 or 20 Level depending on your align: start position: 0% or 20 Level depending on your align: start position: 0% or 20 Level depending on your preferences and for the short area it align: start position: 0% preferences and for the short area it align: start position: 0% preferences and for the short area it will be area 70 to 80 now let's combine align: start position: 0% will be area 70 to 80 now let's combine align: start position: 0% will be area 70 to 80 now let's combine it together so we can have a look on align: start position: 0% it together so we can have a look on align: start position: 0% it together so we can have a look on some trading setups this is a decent align: start position: 0% some trading setups this is a decent align: start position: 0% some trading setups this is a decent example at the beginning you can see we align: start position: 0% example at the beginning you can see we align: start position: 0% example at the beginning you can see we got into extreme area where stochastic align: start position: 0% got into extreme area where stochastic align: start position: 0% got into extreme area where stochastic showing crossover however the RSI stays align: start position: 0% showing crossover however the RSI stays align: start position: 0% showing crossover however the RSI stays red so at this point I'll wait for the align: start position: 0% red so at this point I'll wait for the align: start position: 0% red so at this point I'll wait for the price to move a bit and see if there if align: start position: 0% price to move a bit and see if there if align: start position: 0% price to move a bit and see if there if Trend continues or not just in a while align: start position: 0% Trend continues or not just in a while align: start position: 0% Trend continues or not just in a while we got another signal and RSI is screen align: start position: 0% we got another signal and RSI is screen align: start position: 0% we got another signal and RSI is screen so this is a valid signal personally I'd align: start position: 0% so this is a valid signal personally I'd align: start position: 0% so this is a valid signal personally I'd like to see both lines of stochastic align: start position: 0% like to see both lines of stochastic align: start position: 0% like to see both lines of stochastic going below the extreme value but let's align: start position: 0% going below the extreme value but let's align: start position: 0% going below the extreme value but let's say we took a trade for the sake of this align: start position: 0% say we took a trade for the sake of this align: start position: 0% say we took a trade for the sake of this video stop loss goes to the recent low align: start position: 0% video stop loss goes to the recent low align: start position: 0% video stop loss goes to the recent low and I like to aim at least for 1. 5 risk align: start position: 0% and I like to aim at least for 1. 5 risk align: start position: 0% and I like to aim at least for 1. 5 risk to reward ratio after making a new high align: start position: 0% to reward ratio after making a new high align: start position: 0% to reward ratio after making a new high we got another pullback stochastic align: start position: 0% we got another pullback stochastic align: start position: 0% we got another pullback stochastic giving crossover and with nice bullish align: start position: 0% giving crossover and with nice bullish align: start position: 0% giving crossover and with nice bullish candle we have a signal from the RSI align: start position: 0% candle we have a signal from the RSI align: start position: 0% candle we have a signal from the RSI same stop- loss and taking profit and align: start position: 0% same stop- loss and taking profit and align: start position: 0% same stop- loss and taking profit and after a while we got also another signal align: start position: 0% after a while we got also another signal align: start position: 0% after a while we got also another signal in this piece of price action The Profit align: start position: 0% in this piece of price action The Profit align: start position: 0% in this piece of price action The Profit itself would be amazing let's look at align: start position: 0% itself would be amazing let's look at align: start position: 0% itself would be amazing let's look at the short example we can see a nice push align: start position: 0% the short example we can see a nice push align: start position: 0% the short example we can see a nice push to the downside RSI holding red which is align: start position: 0% to the downside RSI holding red which is align: start position: 0% to the downside RSI holding red which is a very good sign as soon as we hit align: start position: 0% a very good sign as soon as we hit align: start position: 0% a very good sign as soon as we hit extreme level on sastic we got nice align: start position: 0% extreme level on sastic we got nice align: start position: 0% extreme level on sastic we got nice cross over with a strong bearish candle align: start position: 0% cross over with a strong bearish candle align: start position: 0% cross over with a strong bearish candle this is a setup you want to trade stop align: start position: 0% this is a setup you want to trade stop align: start position: 0% this is a setup you want to trade stop loss about the recent high and 1. 5 risk align: start position: 0% loss about the recent high and 1. 5 risk align: start position: 0% loss about the recent high and 1. 5 risk dward ratio again in this example you align: start position: 0% dward ratio again in this example you align: start position: 0% dward ratio again in this example you can see RSI holding the green zone which align: start position: 0% can see RSI holding the green zone which align: start position: 0% can see RSI holding the green zone which is always nice to have just like the align: start position: 0% is always nice to have just like the align: start position: 0% is always nice to have just like the previous example once we hit extreme align: start position: 0% previous example once we hit extreme align: start position: 0% previous example once we hit extreme level on stochastics we got a clean align: start position: 0% level on stochastics we got a clean align: start position: 0% level on stochastics we got a clean signal stop- loss below the recent low align: start position: 0% signal stop- loss below the recent low align: start position: 0% signal stop- loss below the recent low and the same taking profits this is a align: start position: 0% and the same taking profits this is a align: start position: 0% and the same taking profits this is a similar price action but for a short align: start position: 0% similar price action but for a short align: start position: 0% similar price action but for a short after trending down for a while we got a align: start position: 0% after trending down for a while we got a align: start position: 0% after trending down for a while we got a slight pullback with sarcastic reaching align: start position: 0% slight pullback with sarcastic reaching align: start position: 0% slight pullback with sarcastic reaching the Zone RSI slightly pop up but goes align: start position: 0% the Zone RSI slightly pop up but goes align: start position: 0% the Zone RSI slightly pop up but goes red right away that's our signal with align: start position: 0% red right away that's our signal with align: start position: 0% red right away that's our signal with the same stoploss rules as usual and the align: start position: 0% the same stoploss rules as usual and the align: start position: 0% the same stoploss rules as usual and the taking profit as well this is looking align: start position: 0% taking profit as well this is looking align: start position: 0% taking profit as well this is looking pretty cool but you can make this even align: start position: 0% pretty cool but you can make this even align: start position: 0% pretty cool but you can make this even better every trading strategy will have align: start position: 0% better every trading strategy will have align: start position: 0% better every trading strategy will have ups and downs in the market so I want to align: start position: 0% ups and downs in the market so I want to align: start position: 0% ups and downs in the market so I want to make sure I am able to spot best trading align: start position: 0% make sure I am able to spot best trading align: start position: 0% make sure I am able to spot best trading conditions for my setup for this from align: start position: 0% conditions for my setup for this from align: start position: 0% conditions for my setup for this from all the tools I've tested exponential align: start position: 0% all the tools I've tested exponential align: start position: 0% all the tools I've tested exponential moving averages works the best for me so align: start position: 0% moving averages works the best for me so align: start position: 0% moving averages works the best for me so search on trading view for multiple EMAs align: start position: 0% search on trading view for multiple EMAs align: start position: 0% search on trading view for multiple EMAs or EMA Cloud what we want is at least align: start position: 0% or EMA Cloud what we want is at least align: start position: 0% or EMA Cloud what we want is at least four EMAs that has a value 21 55 100 and align: start position: 0% four EMAs that has a value 21 55 100 and align: start position: 0% four EMAs that has a value 21 55 100 and 150 of course you can have more but this align: start position: 0% 150 of course you can have more but this align: start position: 0% 150 of course you can have more but this is my base for identifying proper align: start position: 0% is my base for identifying proper align: start position: 0% is my base for identifying proper conditions let's have a look on some align: start position: 0% conditions let's have a look on some align: start position: 0% conditions let's have a look on some trading setups first we need to have all align: start position: 0% trading setups first we need to have all align: start position: 0% trading setups first we need to have all EMAs to be align upwards so after a align: start position: 0% EMAs to be align upwards so after a align: start position: 0% EMAs to be align upwards so after a proper Cross of all EMAs we will wait align: start position: 0% proper Cross of all EMAs we will wait align: start position: 0% proper Cross of all EMAs we will wait for a signal from the sastic once we align: start position: 0% for a signal from the sastic once we align: start position: 0% for a signal from the sastic once we have a crossover on stochastics align: start position: 0% have a crossover on stochastics align: start position: 0% have a crossover on stochastics supported by proper Direction with EMA align: start position: 0% supported by proper Direction with EMA align: start position: 0% supported by proper Direction with EMA we take a trade with the same stop- loss align: start position: 0% we take a trade with the same stop- loss align: start position: 0% we take a trade with the same stop- loss and taking profit rules as you can see align: start position: 0% and taking profit rules as you can see align: start position: 0% and taking profit rules as you can see EMAs can be a very powerful tool in the align: start position: 0% EMAs can be a very powerful tool in the align: start position: 0% EMAs can be a very powerful tool in the trending Market as it will be easier to align: start position: 0% trending Market as it will be easier to align: start position: 0% trending Market as it will be easier to spot a pullback and it can give you a align: start position: 0% spot a pullback and it can give you a align: start position: 0% spot a pullback and it can give you a clear idea where you want to look for align: start position: 0% clear idea where you want to look for align: start position: 0% clear idea where you want to look for another trade you can also think of it align: start position: 0% another trade you can also think of it align: start position: 0% another trade you can also think of it as some kind of support once it's broken align: start position: 0% as some kind of support once it's broken align: start position: 0% as some kind of support once it's broken you better wait for better trading align: start position: 0% you better wait for better trading align: start position: 0% you better wait for better trading conditions to see also some short setup align: start position: 0% conditions to see also some short setup align: start position: 0% conditions to see also some short setup let's check this EMA cross price and the align: start position: 0% let's check this EMA cross price and the align: start position: 0% let's check this EMA cross price and the EMA moving very nicely and sastic gave align: start position: 0% EMA moving very nicely and sastic gave align: start position: 0% EMA moving very nicely and sastic gave us noticeable crossover after crossover align: start position: 0% us noticeable crossover after crossover align: start position: 0% us noticeable crossover after crossover we take a trade because everything is in align: start position: 0% we take a trade because everything is in align: start position: 0% we take a trade because everything is in our favor RSI is red EMA is trending align: start position: 0% our favor RSI is red EMA is trending align: start

another favorite align: start position: 0% testing retest cloud is another favorite setup of mine imagine we having a EMAs align: start position: 0% setup of mine imagine we having a EMAs align: start position: 0% setup of mine imagine we having a EMAs that changing the direction so all of align: start position: 0% that changing the direction so all of align: start position: 0% that changing the direction so all of them Crossing in One Direction then what align: start position: 0% them Crossing in One Direction then what align: start position: 0% them Crossing in One Direction then what I want to see is the price coming back align: start position: 0% I want to see is the price coming back align: start position: 0% I want to see is the price coming back to those EMAs for a retest till this align: start position: 0% to those EMAs for a retest till this align: start position: 0% to those EMAs for a retest till this moment I don't even bother to look at align: start position: 0% moment I don't even bother to look at align: start position: 0% moment I don't even bother to look at these stochastics but when it reaches my align: start position: 0% these stochastics but when it reaches my align: start position: 0% these stochastics but when it reaches my area of Interest I am looking for a align: start position: 0% area of Interest I am looking for a align: start position: 0% area of Interest I am looking for a price to reject from that area and align: start position: 0% price to reject from that area and align: start position: 0% price to reject from that area and continue in direction of EMAs this is a align: start position: 0% continue in direction of EMAs this is a align: start position: 0% continue in direction of EMAs this is a very simple and stressfree setup in my align: start position: 0% very simple and stressfree setup in my align: start position: 0% very simple and stressfree setup in my opinion absolutely love it and there's align: start position: 0% opinion absolutely love it and there's align: start position: 0% opinion absolutely love it and there's of course much more setups but it's align: start position: 0% of course much more setups but it's align: start position: 0% of course much more setups but it's probably overwhelming for you guys so align: start position: 0% probably overwhelming for you guys so align: start position: 0% probably overwhelming for you guys so maybe next time
