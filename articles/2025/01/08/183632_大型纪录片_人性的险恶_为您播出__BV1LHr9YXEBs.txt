Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Outline and Structure**

*   **A. Introduction:**
    *   A delivery driver encounters a "bear child" (a term for a badly behaved child).
    *   The encounter happens in an elevator, likened to a "prison."
    *   The two do not know each other, and had no prior interaction.
*   **B. Incident:**
    *   The "bear child" witnesses the delivery driver's delivery failure, appearing triumphant.
    *   Initially, the child's actions seem like simple misbehavior.
    *   However, the child deliberately presses a floor button outside the normal range (between 7 and 20).
    *   This reveals the child is aware of what he's doing and is intentionally causing trouble.
*   **C. Escalation and Retraction:**
    *   The child is not satisfied and tries to press another button.
    *   The delivery driver shows anger and this results in the child hesitating.
    *   The child is testing boundaries knowing he might be punished, suggesting a more sinister motivation.
*   **D. Conclusion:**
    *   The child's behavior is categorized as "pure evil."
    *   The need for parental guidance and education is emphasized, to teach the child appropriate behavior.

**II. Core Point:**
The core point is that a child knowingly and deliberately causes trouble, demonstrating a malicious intent rather than innocent mischief.

**III. Fundamental Point:**
The fundamental point is the importance of early childhood education and guidance in curbing potentially harmful behaviors, and the potential for "evil" to manifest at a young age.

**IV. Overarching Framework:**
The overarching framework is a real-life encounter that reveals a child's malicious behavior and the need for effective parenting.

**V. Conceptual Map:**
