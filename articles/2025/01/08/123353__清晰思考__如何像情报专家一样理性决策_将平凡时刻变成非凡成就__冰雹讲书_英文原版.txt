WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en-US You may have heard the saying that choice is more important than effort. Major decisions at key points in life will affect our destiny. But have you ever thought about what supports us in making these choices? Why do people with similar starting points have different achievements? Can it be that big? The book we are going to talk about today will tell us that what determines these is the quality of thinking. Clear Thinking (Clear Thinking) The author of this book is Canadian intelligence expert Shane Parrish. He believes that what really affects our success is not just Those big life nodes are also those moments of choice that we usually don’t even realize. Parrish’s experience is very special. He used to be a senior intelligence officer. Decision-making is very risky and requires high-quality thinking. There is no room for mistakes. After leaving the intelligence community, he started a blog. It's called Farnam Street, which is particularly popular among Wall Street elites. Now he specializes in training corporate executives to teach them how to optimize decision-making. In this book, he uses his own thinking models and perspectives as well as those of hundreds of industry leaders he has communicated with. The decision-making methods are all written down. Only by learning to think clearly can you avoid the weaknesses of human nature, improve the quality of decision-making, and occupy a favorable position for your future. Next, I will dismantle this book for you, hoping that you can get out of the bottleneck of thinking and move towards high-quality thinking. Once life is freed from biological instincts, humans always boast that they are rational animals, but very few can actually do so because most people do not realize that their brains have long been hijacked by biological instincts. Acting without thinking may cost you. It’s a painful price, so the first step we have to do to get rid of mediocrity is to overcome biological instincts, which are human weaknesses. Parrish summarized four instincts, which are: let’s talk about the first point: emotional instinct. When someone criticizes our work and opinions, we We instinctively defend. When someone challenges our beliefs, we cannot stand it anymore and attack the other person instead. When someone challenges our status, we subconsciously fight for status. For example, some drivers get angry when they see someone overtaking, causing an accident. You see, these are all emotional instincts, which will often reset all your efforts to zero. The second one is the egotistical instinct. We tend to overestimate our abilities and develop a sense of luck, thinking that we are the chosen ones. How can bad things happen to us? This brings unnecessary risks, and arrogance makes people eager to prove to others that they are right. It becomes a battle of self-esteem at the expense of the outcome. American General Benedict Arnold fell into the trap of ego. During the Revolutionary War, he was a great hero with great military exploits, but he was a very arrogant person. He often humiliated his colleagues to show his superiority, and also misappropriated Congress' money to live a luxurious life. Therefore, although he had many military exploits, he was not appreciated or promoted. When young officers were promoted, he felt that he was being squeezed out. In 1780, he was extremely dissatisfied and secretly contacted British spies to plot to betray his country and sell the strategic location of West Point. After the plan was exposed, he fled to England. People looked down on him and thought he was an opportunist. In the end, his name was equated with a traitor, and he ended up lonely and frustrated all his life. This may be the price of being conceited. The third one is the gregarious instinct. In ancient times, this instinct had It helps us gain the protection of the group and survive. But Parrish warned that just because everyone else is doing it, it doesn’t mean it is necessarily better. If you do the same thing as everyone else, you can only fall into vicious competition. Suppose there is a group of people digging trenches. Digging by hand can only move a little bit of soil per hour. At this time, two people decided to take a week off to think about whether there is a faster way. However, in the eyes of their companions, these two people are simply crazy. They can't even finish the work. You still have to do it. I wanted to be lazy, but a few days later these two people invented the shovel, which completely changed the rules of the game. So if you want to get rid of mediocrity, you have to differentiate. I personally agree with Parrish's point of view. In modern society, you don't need to stick together to resist the beast. You can pursue something. Personalizing our economy If we want to achieve successful transformation and enter the ranks of developed countries, we need young people to have some different ideas and be a little innovative. Maybe our friends in front of the screen will say that our East Asian society attaches great importance to the collective pursuit of individuality and will face a lot of pressure. But if you think about it in turn, challenges mean opportunities. Most people in the West pursue individuality. How difficult is it to differentiate? In China, most people are very similar. You only need to be slightly different to stand out. Parrish writes in the fourth book Inertia instinct, we tend to maintain the status quo, even if there are benefits to change, we will resist it because maintaining the status quo requires no effort, is comfortable, and does not require taking any risks. Moreover, when we are stubborn, we will turn a blind eye to contradictory new information and only see what we want to see. This kind of thinking inertia is like boiling a frog in warm water, causing us to lose the opportunity to grow. There are too many examples of this in history. For example, when cars, televisions, and airplanes were first invented, most people scorned them. But when they came back, they missed the opportunity and couldn't keep up with the times. If you can realize these weaknesses of human nature, then you have surpassed most people. So how do you overcome these weaknesses? Do you rely on willpower? Of course not, Parrish believes that willpower is very unstable and we use it up in two bursts a day. What we need to do is to turn excellent thinking into subconscious habits. Just like truly self-disciplined people, they don’t need self-control. Good habits are their automatic second-hand. Build a strong mind. If you want to overcome the weaknesses of human nature, you need to cultivate these four strong people. Let’s first talk about self-accountability. People who are self-accountable do not need to be driven by external rewards and will not develop a victim mentality because of a momentary frustration. Parrish emphasizes that our life In fact, a large part of the result is in our own hands. An experience of Parrish's childhood made him realize this. Once Parrish went home with his classmates after school. The classmates teased and bullied another classmate. Parrish stood in front of him without stopping him. There he saw his father driving to pick him up. When he saw this scene, he asked him why he didn't stop it. Parrish said that everyone was doing it and I couldn't help it. His father said seriously that you didn't have a choice. You chose not to stop others from doing something. Doesn't mean you can't make different choices The sentence " You have to be responsible for your own choices" was deeply imprinted on Parrish's psychology, which made him understand the truth that we have the power to make the right choice at any time. Parrish emphasized that the thinking of the strong is no matter how bad the environment is. No matter how bad your cards are, you should be responsible for your own actions and do your best with the things you can control. The second thought is self-awareness. People should have self-knowledge. They should not only understand their own strengths but also know where the boundaries of their abilities are. Parrish took him. For example, a friend who is an investor once had a dinner party with a real estate investor. A guest at the dinner table proposed a business idea to the investor and hoped that he would invest. It sounded very professional and exciting, but the investor refused on the spot. The person at the dinner table asked just this What a great idea. Why did you reject it? He said I know nothing about this industry. I would rather focus on the areas I am familiar with. Do you think this is similar to Buffett? Buffett is determined not to invest in industries that he does not understand. It is precisely because of this. Buffett has been able to achieve steady growth in wealth through so many economic cycles. Buffett also proposed a concept called the personal circle of competence. Whether it is investing or doing things, you must know the boundaries of your abilities so that you will not stumble. The third thinking is self-control. We must have The ability to control our own fears, desires and emotions. We cannot follow animal instincts. Separate emotions and self and return to rationality. Maintaining self-discipline is much more important than the impulse of consciousness. The fourth thinking is self-confidence and belief in one's own abilities and values. It is independent thinking. The premise is that it allows you to make difficult decisions in the face of social pressure, arrogance, inertia, and emotional instincts. Confidence is not the same as arrogance. A truly confident person is not afraid to admit his or her weaknesses and can ask people who are stronger than themselves in some aspects for advice. Parrish, who was forced to prove that he was right, shared the story of an executive who came to him for consultation. The executive was competing with his colleagues for the position of CEO successor. They both proposed strategies, but he found that his opponent's strategy was more advantageous than his, so he decided He was very confused whether he should forcefully prove that his strategy was right or support his opponent's strategy. In the end, he chose to support his opponent. It was precisely because of this that he was elected CEO by the board of directors because he did not prove that he was right for vanity but really did good for the company. This is a kind of advanced self-confidence. After you learn these four strong thoughts, you have to practice more and let these thoughts become your automatic mode. Three: Set high standards to get rid of mediocrity. If you want to be outstanding, you must set high standards. If a person has high standards for himself, If you ask to do the same thing as the people around you, you will only get average results. Parrish wrote how to become excellent? The best way to learn is to work with a master. Choosing an excellent life coach is so important. If they have the skills, traits, and character you want to learn, add them to your personal board of directors. Even if these people are not in your direct circle of friends, you can use the Internet to listen to their interviews and learn their thoughts. These excellent people can teach you hidden things. Knowledge and methods, and these knowledge methods may take you a lifetime to find out on your own, so seeing talents and empathizing with others is the shortest way to excellence. Four high-quality decision-making processes. If you want to make high-quality decisions, you need to do the following steps: define problems, explore solutions Evaluate options, make judgments, and execute the best choice. The first step is to define the problem. Schools and companies often tell us that solving problems is the most important thing. However, many times when we work hard to solve problems, we find that the problem was defined wrongly at the beginning, which is a waste of time. Therefore, Parrish emphasizes that the correct problem is proposed. The problem is the key. Parrish gave an example of an animal shelter. There are too many dogs in the shelter and they can't accommodate them. More than 3 million dogs enter the shelter every year, but only 1. 4 million can be adopted. At first, the shelter thought The problem is that adoption efforts are not strong enough, so they vigorously promote publicity to encourage people to adopt more dogs. However, the adoption rate cannot keep up with the rate of abandonment. The shelter is still full. At this time, the person in charge realizes that the previous definition of the problem is wrong. If people did not abandon dogs in the first place, the problem would not be a problem. Is it solved at the source? So they provide free rabies vaccines and dog food to dog owners because it is cheaper than taking in dogs. This trick is really effective. 75% of people who originally planned to abandon their dogs chose not to abandon them. Then the shelter will be spacious. So to solve the problem, first you have to identify the root of the problem. The second step is to explore possible solutions. Parrish believes that the most advanced solution is not to wait for the problem to arise but to solve it before the problem occurs. To anticipate the worst outcome, it is best to prevent it from happening. If it does happen, you need to have a plan to deal with it. At this time, you have to think one more step and ask yourself whether this option is consistent with your long-term goals. Don’t just think about it. Now I also need to read in your life book that when a problem arises, you should give yourself at least three options and urge yourself to think of more ways to avoid putting yourself in a desperate situation. When you have to choose between two options, find a way to combine the two options. Sometimes you can have your cake and eat it too. When Isadore Sharp founded Four Seasons Hotels, he saw that there were two common business models on the market. One was a small hotel with limited facilities but able to provide personalized services, and the other was a large hotel with facilities. Complete but not very personalized service. Sharp simply combined the advantages of these two models to create a new business model to fill the gap in the market. In addition, you also have to consider opportunity costs. For example, what happened when Carnegie operated trains. In a train accident, the carriage was damaged. Should he choose to repair it or dispose of it on the spot? He calculated that if it was repaired, it would have to be out of service for a few days. The loss would be higher than the cost of purchasing a new carriage, so he simply burned it on the spot. Once you understand the above points, you will have some potential options. The third step is to evaluate the options. You must think clearly about what is most important to you. Without clear personal preferences and personal standards, there is no way to evaluate the quality of the options. Just like a company, if the managers don't want to be clear about their own standards and values, then the employees will have no idea what the boss wants, then the company will lose its direction and won't be able to carry out business. In addition to clear standards, you also need to obtain accurate information, because the quality of information determines you. The book says that your body needs nutrition for the quality of your thinking and decision-making, and the same goes for your mind. So if you want to get nutritious knowledge, watch my channel more and it will make your brain strong. Parrish proposed two principles for obtaining high-quality information. One is the principle of high fidelity. Information should be as close to the source as possible and should not be filtered by people with ulterior motives. Strong thinkers obtain source information through personal experience or study of examples. This is why I explain every time Before I read the original English book page by page, I wrote dozens or even hundreds of pages of reading notes, systematically retaining the core argumentation framework of each chapter in the book, so that everyone can get as close as possible to the source of high-quality information. Another principle It is a high professional principle to seek advice from experts who are truly knowledgeable. If they have just solved a similar problem, you can ask them for first-hand experience. Parrish suggests that before looking for an expert, it is best to do your own homework and clearly understand your own problems and needs. Paid consultation not only respects the expert's time but also urges you to do your homework. The fourth step is when to take action. It depends on what consequences the decision will have and whether it is reversible. If the decision has no big consequences and the cost of going back on it is very low. Then make a decision as early as possible, just like if you buy a piece of clothing that doesn't fit you and return it, it's over. On the other hand, if the consequences of this decision may be serious and the cost of going back on it is high, then try to make the decision as late as possible. This is like giving birth to a child. You can't go back on your baby once it's born, so you have to spend more time thinking about it before making a decision. However, you can't always put off high-risk decisions. When should you make a decision? You have to look at whether the marginal benefit of information begins to decrease. When you collect information to a certain extent, the cost of missing opportunities will be higher than the cost of collecting more information. When you thoroughly understand the pros and cons of the options, there is nothing new to learn. It’s time to take action. The fifth step is to set a safety margin. Parrish reminds us that when making major decisions, we must leave room for ourselves. Even if the worst outcome happens, you will not be miserable. Just like an engineer building a bridge, he will definitely design the weight of the bridge to be higher than the weight of the bridge. The actual demand is higher. If there are too many cars, the bridge will not collapse. For example, when buying stocks, you cannot invest all your capital. You must invest part of your income within what you can afford. Even if you lose, it will not affect your life. In addition, once you make a plan, you must stick to it as much as possible, because temporary decisions made in emergencies are prone to mistakes. Parrish took climbing Mount Everest as an example. The most dangerous thing is not climbing to the top but going down. Many mountaineers make decisions when they are close to the top. After gritting his teeth and climbing up, he exhausted his strength and oxygen bottles and could not come back. Parrish believed that it was easy for the mountaineering team to make irrational decisions when they were very tired halfway up the mountain. He wrote that for the sake of safety, some mountaineering teams would go ahead in advance. Make a decision and return immediately if it has not reached the top by a certain time. For those who are afraid of making important decisions, Parrish proposed the principle of bullets first and cannonballs later. This is like you are sailing on the opposite side of the ship and an enemy pirate ship comes. Your gunpowder is limited. Take all the gunpowder and use it to fire the cannon. First shoot a few small bullets and find the right angle before firing the cannon. The hit rate will be higher. In other words, you can test it first and then make a decision in a low-cost and low-investment way. There are examples like this in life. Students don’t If you know what kind of industry you are engaged in, first go for an internship and observe how your seniors work. If you want to change jobs, you can start a side job first without quitting your job. If you want to make a product, don’t be in a hurry to produce it. Test the market response first and then start producing it if there is demand. I very much agree with Parrish’s testing method, which is very suitable for young people to start a business with low costs and light assets. Some of my friends started from small things and gradually became self-sufficient. For example, one of my college students is on social media in the United States. She often shared photos of bikinis she designed on the Internet, which first attracted a large number of potential customers, and then she started selling her clothes as an e-commerce company. Now her clothing brand is already quite famous in North America. Another college classmate was wearing it on her face when she was in school. He contacted foreign distilling bottle buyers in the book and unexpectedly received an order. Then he found a foundry next to the school to produce it and earned the first price difference. As the price difference gradually increased, he built his own factory and now it has become large-scale. In short, it is just like Parrish suggested that if you want to reduce risk in decision-making, you must leave yourself some safety margin so that you can rush to seize opportunities while resisting risks. Step 6: Review the decision-making process and record all your decision-making processes so that you can ensure that you really Understand the whole thing and these records will help you review later to see if your decision-making process needs improvement. You can also share these records with others to discuss better decision-making methods Congratulations! Congratulations on seeing this. Now you have understood the entire essence of the book Clear Thinking. Parrish not only shared his decision-making experience when he was an intelligence expert, but also gave us a systematic thinking framework that allows us to overcome biological instincts, develop a strong mind, and set high standards for execution. A high-quality decision-making process turns excellent thinking patterns into your long-term habits. Then every ordinary moment of choice can shape your future. I particularly like the sentence at the beginning of this book and encourage everyone. If your English level is between B2 and C1 That is, the vocabulary is between 4000 and 8000. You can read CET-6 or postgraduate English level. This book has a very clear structure and strong logic. Among the 29 books I have read in 2024, I think it is one of the few that I am willing to read. Finally, if you think my explanation is valuable to you, don’t forget to like, collect and forward messages to share your feelings. Okay, I am Xia Binghai who loves to read original English books. See you next time. See you next time.
