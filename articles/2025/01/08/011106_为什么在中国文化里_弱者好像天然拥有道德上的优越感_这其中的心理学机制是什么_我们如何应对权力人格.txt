Description:
Okay, here's a summary of the provided text, following your instructions:

**1. Summary Outline:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Gratitude for rewards and New Year greetings.
    *   Overview of topics to be discussed: power personality, dealing with "perverts" with power personalities, the perception of weakness in Chinese culture, and the psychological mechanisms behind moral superiority.
    *   Introduction of the book "Yingguo" as the source of insights.
    *   Focus on two specific topics: "Extreme control equals necrophilia" and "Shooting the first bird."
    *   Goal: To encourage a cultural shift from a collectivist mindset to modern civilization.
*   **Extreme Control Equals Necrophilia:**
    *   Anecdote about a mother, her timid son, and her dominant daughter, which mirrors her own relationship with her "incompetent and cowardly" husband.
    *   The husband serves as a "foil" for her, providing a sense of security and control.
    *   This dynamic is common in Chinese marriages, where one partner’s self-development is suppressed for the other's perceived stability.
    *   People often choose partners based on perceived safety (controllability), rather than passion.
    *   This selection mentality, perpetuated over generations, leads to conservative genes.
    *   Desire for control can lead to suppressing the freedom of a partner, and if extreme, it could cause the desire for the partner to be like a zombie in order to fulfill the desire for control.
    *   Necrophilia's core logic means a demand for absolute compliance and conformity.
    *   Dictators and power-obsessed individuals (like Hitler) exhibit this desire for absolute control, viewing others as tools.
    *   They are interested in people being like "corpses", obeying orders 100% and without question.
    *   Strongmen hate others having their own will or offering advice, they live in their own little "cave" where they have the absolute authority
    *   The solution: respect the partner's individuality and encourage them to be themselves.
*   **"Shooting the First Bird" Mentality:**
    *   Chinese culture encourages homogeneity and discourages individuality, leading to fear of being different.
    *   Fear of abandonment and shame/inferiority come when different from the group.
    *   Following the trend is widespread, and individual creativity is suppressed because of the fear of standing out.
    *   This is rooted in primitive jealousy, originating from the symbiotic mother-infant relationship (the desire to monopolize everything).
    *   Primitive jealousy manifests in the desire to control all resources, particularly praise and recognition.
    *   The tendency to portray the most prominent person as the most evil.
    *   Jealousy is categorized into three types: 1) sexual jealousy; 2) primitive jealousy; 3) I don't compete but I hate you for competing and being better than me.
    *   The third type is the root of "shooting the first bird," leading to self-repression and a lack of competition.
    *   Those who don't compete out of fear become morally superior, criticizing others for their success and selflessness, creating a reverse power dynamic of "whoever is weak is justified".
    *   The solution is to embrace competition, develop individual abilities, and genuinely celebrate others' successes.
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Recap of the two main topics: Extreme control equates to necrophilia, and the psychology of "shooting the first bird."

**2. Core Point:**

The core point is that the desire for extreme control, stemming from insecurity and fear, manifests as a destructive need to dominate others and suppresses individuality, leading to stagnation and resentment.

**3. Fundamental Point:**

The fundamental point is that Chinese culture's emphasis on collectivism, coupled with primitive jealousy, fosters a fear of individuality and competition, resulting in self-repression and the tendency to "shoot down" those who stand out.

**4. Overarching Framework:**

The overarching framework is an analysis of certain negative aspects within Chinese culture, particularly the fear of individualism, the need for control stemming from insecurity, and their effects on relationships and society as a whole. It uses psychological concepts and historical examples to dissect these issues.

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en-US First of all, thank you limu5858 for the reward. Thank you for wishing you happiness and happiness in the new year. I wish my friends happiness and well-being. Next is today’s update. What is power personality? How should we deal with perverts like power personality? Why do weak people seem to be weak in Chinese culture? What is the psychological mechanism behind naturally having a sense of moral superiority? Today we continue to read Today's reading chapter of the book Yingguo has the answers to the above questions. Today we read about the two topics of extreme control equal to necrophilia and shooting the first bird. If you want to hear more content, you can subscribe to me. After reading this book on the YouTube channel, I will share more related books on the topic of detoxifying Chinese culture. Let’s kill our own heads together. The Chinese culture virus in the brain is at the individual level to make the cultural exodus from Egypt and jump to the state of modern civilization as soon as possible. Let’s get started. The ultimate desire for control is equivalent to necrophilia. A mother told me a story. Her son is about to enter the first grade of elementary school. There was an experience day before school started. He took his son and his daughter, who was three years older, to school. When they arrived at school, she found that her son was very timid. The child saw a A little neighbor girl wanted to say hello to her and touch her with her hand, but when she turned around, he immediately took two steps back and was speechless. Because of this timidity, he wanted to stick to his mother, while the mother hoped that her son would be independent and able to withstand this small setback. So I half encouraged and half forced my son to find friends to play with. After leaving his mother, the child was very confused and then saw his elder sister playing very relaxed and cool with a few friends. It was he who found his sister and wanted to cling to her. The sister was willing to take her brother with her at first, but soon she became impatient and wanted to push him away. At this time, the brother curled up and wanted to cry, so she had to allow him to cling to her. Then the mother discovered that her son The daze got better, but he started to be a little domineering and hostile to the friends who played with his sister, repelling them from approaching my sister and him. After she told this story, I She sighed and said, "Look, this is also the relationship between you and your husband. She is a strong woman who strives to win, but her husband is a bit incompetent and cowardly. She has wanted to divorce her husband many times, but has never made up her mind. However, the more she looks at him, the more she dislikes him. She really can't understand him. " What does it mean to her? What her daughter means to her son is what her husband means to her. To put it nicely, it means companionship. If it sounds bad, it means companionship. The meaning of this point is to connect the two points together. She suddenly realized something. She said that if she wanted to discuss business in the early stage of her career, she could not go alone because she would panic, so she wanted to take her husband with her. Although the husband could not play any role in discussing business, as long as he Now she can feel much more at ease and be in a better state to face business partners and discuss business. This is just a microcosm and a metaphor. They are more than 20 years old. The epitome of a 20-year-old marriage is that the husband has been playing this role, that is, her foil. He is a little impatient with her just like a daughter and a son, but he cannot leave because he is afraid that she will be sad. In the simplest terms, the husband has satisfied her. The need for security is put in slightly more complicated terms. Her husband provides her with a sense of control. When she is alone and faces the outside world, she becomes panicked. She feels out of control and powerless and doesn't know how to control the outside world, but she has an absolute sense of control over her husband. Of course, this is what she imagined. So when she feels out of control and powerless, she sees her husband, a stable and controllable individual, beside her. She felt at ease, but her peace of mind was accompanied by her husband's impatience and his loss of self. In such an environment, in such a situation In this process, her abilities and self are constantly being stimulated and nourished, while her husband is shrinking because he is just her foil. Too many Chinese marriages are like this. One person is just another person's foil, and this foil is difficult to see. Being respected will lead to contempt. It is difficult for the other party to realize the significance of this foil. Of course, the foil also has its own problems. They are usually compared. The closed one lacks enough motivation to rush into the outside world, so she partially opens up with the help of her partner's motivation, but overall they will lose themselves more and more and become more and more closed-off. Her conditions have always been very good, and there was no shortage of suitors in the beginning. The reason why she chose her husband is like this. A man has a very important feeling. She said that at that time, she felt that he was so safe and reliable. He could see the first thing in his life at a glance. I was shocked when I first heard someone talk about this reason for choosing a mate. But later I discovered that there are actually a lot of people who choose their partners for this reason, and many women said exactly the same thing as this mother. It is easy for men to make similar choices. The language used is that she is very simple, obedient, and well-behaved. If you choose your partner because of this voice, it means that you feel very safe. People who are low are afraid of losing control, so they need to find a partner who is like an inert gas. His inactivity makes you feel easy to control. Indeed, many of them say that they have a partner they like more at the same time to choose. Compared to their partner, they are more passionate, but it is also more difficult. Controlling a woman, she said, "I really can't predict what will happen the next day when I'm with this man. Add a line of comparative biology here. " This selection mentality under the theory of natural evolution in Chinese culture has evolved (evolved) through many generations of selection, resulting in genes such as risk-taking and creativity not being passed on, leaving only those genes that are conservative and unenterprising, making up this dull group. Well, back to the content of this book, the logic begins with the fact that people who will continue to make such choices in the future will tend to suppress their partner’s freedom. By choice: As long as your partner's choice is different from what you imagined, you will feel uneasy and even have a sense of collapse due to loss of control. However, when you are with them, you may feel boring and complain that the other person has no energy. You must understand that it was you who did it. The logic of this choice has been developed to the most serious point, which is the so-called necrophilia. Necrophilia originally refers to a man 's special hobby of raping corpses, but he The core logic is not uncommon. You must be exactly the same as what I imagined. If there is any inconsistency, I will be furious. If you hold this logic, you will eventually find that only by turning the other party into a zombie-like existence can you meet your requirements. Hitler's necrophilia Necrophilia is most easily seen in super strong men such as famous dictators. This is determined by the attributes of power in the famous 1984 novel The judge said to the male protagonist that power means that I can put my foot on your face and you can't resist because you are too obsessed with power and are narcissistic. Strong people are often obsessed with their own judgment and turn a blind eye to the obvious facts. That is, living in a message In the cocoon, it eventually led to some major mistakes, such as Hidler's insistence on letting the German army fight to the end in the Battle of Stalingrad. In the end, the Nazi German army lost 1. 5 million people, which was 1/4 of the total combat effectiveness of Germany. Generally speaking, people think that these strong men are extremely smart, quick-thinking, far-sighted, and rarely make mistakes. But I don't think so. I think they just have super strength. They have a desire to control, especially love to impose their will on others, they are also very decisive, lawless and very perseverant. Therefore, they are particularly decisive, lawless and perseverant. It is just because they have no sympathy and do not care about the suffering of others. Therefore, when they impose their will on others, even for their own small desires, they can harm others disproportionately and do not hesitate at all. Normal people We can't do this because we feel the same pain when we see others being hurt, so I hope Teller could completely ignore the lives of the 1. 5 million German soldiers in the Battle of Stalingrad and just let them implement their own established strategy. But on the contrary, the United States can stage a story like saving Ryan from the Serious Sick. In a world of such dictators, he is the only one. People are human beings, and other people are objects and tools for him to achieve his own goals or satisfy his own desires. He will fantasize about what he can control. All other people in the world will execute his will 100% without compromise, just like he is a chess player and everyone else is a chess piece. He orders the chess pieces to move, and the chess pieces move accordingly. If the chess pieces suddenly move by themselves, He will be furious even if the move made by the chess piece is correct. Therefore, psychologist Fromm believes that Hidler and other top Nazis have power. They have necrophilia with will personality, which means they are not interested in healthy, compassionate, positive, optimistic, and enthusiastic people. They want people to be like corpses, not afraid of pain, obey orders 100%, and not afraid at all when being ordered to die. Without hesitation at all, it was precisely because of this personality that Hitler chose Eva among the many women pursuing her. People inside Teller's relationship with Ava say that to Hitler, Ava was just a cute little thing. She was illogical and stupid. She was just beautiful. But perhaps because of this, Hitler was able to find in her what he had been looking for. Tranquility and relaxation, I think, means that in the private world, he is still the only one with will, and his closest woman is just a person without The chess piece of will must be moved only when he lets her move it. If this woman has an independent personality and knows what she wants and will pursue it relentlessly, then Shidler will lose the tranquility and relaxation he seeks. To find this kind of tranquility and relaxation, he can only find it. Ava is a very dependent and independent woman. She defeats other competitors not because of her charm but because of her dependence. Personality was a fatal temptation for Hitler. Strong people with a strong desire for control rarely like people with the same personality, even if that person is the closest person. So when the eldest son Uday showed his will, Saddam planned an assassination operation to kill himself. Uday, the eldest son, became a crippled strongman in politics. The same is true for strongmen in life. I know that a senior manager of a Hong Kong-funded company finally I hate subordinates giving unsolicited advice. Anyone who does so will be fired, no matter how reasonable the advice is. It is precisely because of this strong personality that people's ability to understand reality is greatly compromised. A German psychologist describes strong people as cavemen. He believes The area of ​​control of a strongman seems to be a cave. In this cave, he has the final say and his subjects have no chance to express their opinions. He can achieve his own will and in this cave he is indeed strategizing, but his insight is limited to this cave. To the world outside the cave, he can only see the limited sky restricted by the cave, so once he wants to establish a connection with the world outside the cave When contacted, he will get dizzy. Add a sentence here. When you hear this, please don’t think of it. Of course, you can use mobile or telecommunications. The worst is I guess psychotherapists can't help with necrophilia. In a general sense, it means overly restricting your partner's free will. First, you need to know what choice you made and respect it. Of course, respect does not mean not changing. What is particularly important is respecting the other person for who they are. Secondly, if you can encourage the other person to be themselves while restraining the over-extension of your own will, if you can't, you can ask a counselor for help. A common mentality among Chinese people is that I want what everyone wants, and I want what everyone wants. This creates a situation where people are all the same, so it is best to get married when it is time to get married. You can’t get divorced, you can’t have a child when it’s time to have a child, you can’t have a DINK. However, we have to compare, so it became that I want a little more than others to prove myself. Excellence, but this kind of excellence lacks individuality and is still a desire for homogeneity. Everyone squeezes into the same road and forms a single-plank bridge. This is wallowing in the quagmire of collectivism. The highest pursuit is to become the king of the collective, but the appearance and personality of this king are still consistent with the collective. We are afraid of the pursuit of individuality because it means that to be yourself means to be separate from the crowd. This leads to a deep sense of fear. It is a The deep obsessive-compulsive disorder must form a voice because the giant baby can only accept people who are the same as himself. If the voice is different from his own, he is a non-self, an alien or even a devil. He should die. It seems that being different from others is a sin in itself. A good friend of mine got married when it was time to get married and gave birth to a child when it was time to have children. He suggested that I should do the same. I asked him why he had to. Do you want to live like this? He said because everyone lives like this. I have always had a hard time understanding his answer. Only after doing consultations did I have a real understanding. Too many visitors said that divorce is a failure for them. Because they are different from others and abnormal, when facing other normal people, they feel inferior and ashamed and feel that others are laughing at them. In fact, society is much more tolerant now and there are too many divorced people. Even if there is such ridicule, it is not too much, so it is mainly their internal perception. The core of this psychology is the fear of being abandoned. In their opinion, the group is the same. If they are different from the group, they will think that they cannot fit in because they are special, so being special becomes a shame instead of cool. A woman took the MBA exam and most of her classmates were younger than her. She could not fit in with the young people. She immediately felt ashamed in the circle of classmates She felt that it was the external condition of being too old that caused her to be unable to integrate into the group and to be in terrible loneliness. In fact, she had always been lonely. When young classmates invited her, she always resisted, but this subtle psychology Lonely babies who are not easily aware and easily blamed for their age are broken and they want to be in a relationship To blend into the crowd is actually to find a mother who can live with them, and the symbiosis mentality will make them think that I have to be like you, and you have to be like me, so that a relationship can be established. If anyone has a personality, the symbiosis will be destroyed, so they need a gun. The mentality of destroying whoever is special and trying to steal the spotlight makes it easy for us to follow the trend. When I was a kid, I I have always wondered why the watermelon sellers in my hometown must make a profit every year and lose money every year. This is always the rule. If you sell watermelons and make a profit, everyone will plant watermelons. However, if there are too many watermelons, you will lose money. Most people will not plant them, and the profit of planting watermelons will be very low. A few people made money again, and everyone followed suit and then lost money. This cycle lasted for many years, first to grow watermelons and then to breed. For example, raising chickens and pigs, etc. , following the trend becomes even more terrifying. In some cities, following the trend is also common. For example, after the big yellow duck in Hong Kong became a sensation, the big yellow duck was copied all over the country. As a result, this is not special. The creator of the big yellow duck I am confused and angry that his copyright has not been respected. An individualistic society will despise this kind of following the trend, but collective advocates Social following is like an inevitable symbiotic psychology, which is one of the key factors that lead to the same thing. The other key is primitive jealousy. Jealousy in the general sense is in the relationship between men and women, and primitive jealousy is the psychology of exclusivity, which is what we call pink eye disease. His true psychology is that I want to keep all the beauty to myself and don’t want to share anything with anyone else. Even if a place is better than mine, I will be envious, jealous, and hateful. Primitive jealousy also comes from symbiosis psychology, that is, the baby feels that the mother only belongs to me. We understand this as exclusive ownership of the mother, but from the baby's point of view, he feels that he and his mother are the same. He and his mother are one and the world. Of course, the world will revolve around him. The jealousy in the triangle relationship between men and women is endless. The same primitive jealousy takes up all resources, especially praise and recognition. If someone poses a threat, it will cause violent emotions. When the TV series Hua Qiangu became popular, I briefly watched it, only the first few episodes and the end. A few episodes of brainstorming, well-produced and good emotional expressions, but I can’t stand the common logic in domestic dramas, which is that all men Everybody loves the heroine and all women love the hero. It’s a bit too much to say that everything is over the top, but that’s pretty much it. Still prefer the complex emotional world in Game of Thrones, where no one is the absolute center. All men love me all. Women are all jealous that I am so pure and kind. This is what Hua Qiangu said. The first half of the sentence is about primitive jealousy. It is taboo to express this mentality directly because the desire to monopolize everything will naturally arouse the resentment and backlash of others. For example, Ni Mantian directly asked for this, so everyone resented her. As for Hua Qiangu, I won’t argue with you. Look at me as being extremely kind, but I automatically become the center of the world. A kind-hearted way to become the center of the world is much safer. In fact, this is the so-called green tea bitch's path circulated on the Internet. After this path failed, Hua Qiangu's true nature was exposed and he became a demon god who can do whatever he wants and is omnipotent. His original possessiveness is far greater than Guo Nimantian's primitive jealousy also has subtle expressions in the mother-infant community, so he feels that all the problems in the mother-infant community All good things should be attributed to him alone. For example, if Hua Qiangu ’s mother died when she was born and she still grew up so well, then the credit should naturally be attributed to her destiny and not to her mediocre father. After writing this, I kind of understood how Yue Fei’s father’s unjust case was resolved. Yue Fei's father was an ideal, rich and kind man who trained Yue Fei to be both civil and military. It was not until Yue Fei emerged on the battlefield that he However, there is a folk legend that Yue Fei suffered a flood just three days after he was born. After his father died, he remained poor and dependent on his mother. This erased Yue Fei's father's contribution and made it appear that Yue Fei became a talent automatically as if he had destiny. Common jealousies are divided into three types: the first triangle relationship. Sexual jealousy in the second primitive jealousy third I can't be good and you can't be good jealousy I suppressed I don’t compete but you actually compete and you are better than me. I hate you to death. I hate myself. Why don’t I compete? In my opinion, the third type of jealousy is the deep-seated reason for shooting the first bird, and it also evolved from primitive jealousy. People with primitive jealousy will wish the other person to die if they are better than themselves. This mentality projected onto others will become if I am better than others. If I'm good, others will want me to die, so I won't compete out of fear for fear of being hated to death. But in the same way, you can't compete, otherwise I'll hate you to death. The third type of jealousy causes us to live repressed, restraining our desire to compete. Stretching out one's hands and feet without looking after others is equivalent to castrating oneself. Naturally, one cannot help but castrate others, so there is This kind of philosophy is that what is beautiful in the forest will be destroyed by the wind. We only accept one person to compete selflessly, so too many Chinese people pretend to serve the people when they compete and do not serve others. Everyone is like an energy bubble and he wants to stretch himself. And competition is the most natural way to stretch, so the way to solve the third type of jealousy is to develop your own abilities well. Courageously pursue what you want, let your life fully stretch, and at the same time bless the development of others. Not daring to stretch and competing secretly will look very wretched. One of the visitors is an entrepreneur. He wants to monopolize everything and can’t wait to dominate every aspect. The strongest, but at the same time he is a person who severely compresses himself, but gradually tastes the beauty of stretching his arms and legs. His original jealousy has become much lighter and he can sincerely bless others. A mother said that her 6-year-old daughter told her that when I was little, I thought I was the best and others were better than me. I would cry, but now that others are better than me, I don’t. I will cry because I think I am the best. This is a truth. After you really feel that you are good, you can accept the good of others. The third type of jealousy can easily lead to this kind of jealousy. As a result, I didn't develop myself and put myself in a very low and weak position. But in this weak position, I felt moral superiority, and then I could see that everything was not pleasing to my eyes. After all, I suppressed myself and became a person. Noble people, you see, those white, rich, beautiful, rich and handsome people are all selfish and possessive bad guys. This is also a characteristic of our culture. We try our best to Although we also admire the strong, we generally think that they are bad people who plundered other people's resources to become strong. As for the weak, because they compressed their own energy and showed their selflessness, they seemed to be able to despise everyone. This is also the case for many people. You can confidently complain about other people's reasons on the Internet because their lives are so poor. Then you can attack other people morally. If you are in a From a very low position, speech is free and invincible. Although the real situation is that those in power have the final say, in public opinion we have the opposite truth, that is, whoever is weak is justified, who is poor, and who is justified. Today’s reading sharing ends here. Today we read two special topics: Extreme Control Equals Necrophilia and Shooting the First Bird. We look forward to seeing you again in the next reading sharing.
