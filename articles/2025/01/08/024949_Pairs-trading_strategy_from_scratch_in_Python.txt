### Summary:

**1. Core Ideas:**

  *   **Paris Trading Strategy:** This video explores a market-neutral Paris trading strategy inspired by Edward Thorp, which aims to profit from price discrepancies between correlated assets, regardless of market direction (uptrend, downtrend, or range).
  *   **Z-Score & Mean Reversion:**  The strategy uses the z-score of the price spread between two assets, combined with mean reversion principles, to identify potential trading opportunities.
  *   **Cointegration:** It emphasizes that the price series of the chosen assets need to be cointegrated; that is, while not individually stationary, a linear combination of them (like the price spread) should be stationary.
  *   **Implementation with Jesse:** The video details the implementation of this strategy using the Jesse trading framework, demonstrating data acquisition, calculations, and backtesting.
  *   **Practical Challenges:** The backtesting results indicate significant challenges related to high trading fees and slippage, which necessitate additional filters and considerations.

**2. Outline:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Explanation of Paris trading based on Edward Thorp's strategy.
    *   Goal of creating a market-neutral strategy.
    *   Overview of the video's content: Chart demonstration, mathematical explanation, and Jesse implementation.
*   **Core Idea Explanation:**
    *   Example using Ethereum and Ethereum Classic to illustrate price correlation.
    *   Explanation of long and short positions to profit from the price difference.
    *   The idea of capitalizing on the difference between the returns of two correlated assets
*   **Mathematical Background and Implementation:**
    *   Use of Jupyter notebooks to showcase the underlying mathematics
    *   Importing libraries, acquiring price data of ETH and ETC.
    *   Converting price data to returns.
    *   Calculating the price spread and the z-score.
    *   Plotting the z-score and mean with thresholds.
*   **Jesse Implementation:**
    *   Creation of two strategies (P trading and P trading two) within Jesse to manage the two assets.
    *   Use of shared variables to pass information between the two trading routes.
    *   Explanation of the `before`, `shoot_long`, `shoot_short`, and `update_position` methods in each strategy.
    *   Definition of buying and selling logic for each asset, based on z-score thresholds and mean reversion principles.
    *   Implementation of dynamic position sizing using the beta coefficient.
    *   Implementation of a daily check for cointegration to close positions if cointegration is broken.
*   **Backtesting and Analysis:**
    *   Initial backtesting shows very high profitability with no trading fees.
    *   Realistic backtesting with actual trading fees, reveals significant losses.
    *   Discussion on the implications of high trading fees and slippage.
    *   Suggestion to implement more filters or to use more volatile assets to counteract trading fees.
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Encouragement to further research and refine the strategy.
    *   Invitation to join Discord and share results and improvements.
    *   Announcement of a giveaway.

**3. Core Point:** The core point is to create a profitable trading strategy by capitalizing on the correlated movement of assets using mean reversion and statistical tools such as Z-score and cointegration, while the backtest result highlights the importance of accounting for real world issues like fees and slippage.

**4. Fundamental Point:** The fundamental point is that while a theoretical market-neutral strategy can appear highly profitable, real-world constraints like trading fees and slippage pose significant challenges and must be carefully considered for a practical implementation.

**5. Overarching Framework:** The content follows a progression from theoretical explanation to practical implementation and testing. It starts with an abstract idea, then breaks it down into a mathematical model, converts it into code using Jesse, and finally tests the strategy, where a major pitfall is revealed.

his worst monthly loss was align: start position: 0% month but his worst monthly loss was less than 1% it's a market neutal align: start position: 0% less than 1% it's a market neutal align: start position: 0% less than 1% it's a market neutal strategy which means potentially we can align: start position: 0% strategy which means potentially we can align: start position: 0% strategy which means potentially we can make money whether if the price is in an align: start position: 0% make money whether if the price is in an align: start position: 0% make money whether if the price is in an uptrend A downtrend or even in a Range align: start position: 0% uptrend A downtrend or even in a Range align: start position: 0% uptrend A downtrend or even in a Range I'm going to show it on a chart in a align: start position: 0% I'm going to show it on a chart in a align: start position: 0% I'm going to show it on a chart in a second but then I will also show the align: start position: 0% second but then I will also show the align: start position: 0% second but then I will also show the basic math behind it in a Jupiter align: start position: 0% basic math behind it in a Jupiter align: start position: 0% basic math behind it in a Jupiter notebook and then we will write it align: start position: 0% notebook and then we will write it align: start position: 0% notebook and then we will write it inside Jesse so we can run some back align: start position: 0% inside Jesse so we can run some back align: start position: 0% inside Jesse so we can run some back test and see some actual results so if align: start position: 0% test and see some actual results so if align: start position: 0% test and see some actual results so if that sounds interesting let's get right align: start position: 0% that sounds interesting let's get right align: start position: 0% that sounds interesting let's get right into align: start position: 0% into align: start position: 0% into it all right let's begin with a very align: start position: 0% it all right let's begin with a very align: start position: 0% it all right let's begin with a very simple example ethereum versus ethereum align: start position: 0% simple example ethereum versus ethereum align: start position: 0% simple example ethereum versus ethereum classic they have different price ranges align: start position: 0% classic they have different price ranges align: start position: 0% classic they have different price ranges ethereum is in matter of thousands of align: start position: 0% ethereum is in matter of thousands of align: start position: 0% ethereum is in matter of thousands of dollars but ethereum classic is I think align: start position: 0% dollars but ethereum classic is I think align: start position: 0% dollars but ethereum classic is I think in hundreds but we know their prices are align: start position: 0% in hundreds but we know their prices are align: start position: 0% in hundreds but we know their prices are highly correlated and that's really what align: start position: 0% highly correlated and that's really what align: start position: 0% highly correlated and that's really what we care about so for example on this align: start position: 0% we care about so for example on this align: start position: 0% we care about so for example on this chart I have both their prizes and I've align: start position: 0% chart I have both their prizes and I've align: start position: 0% chart I have both their prizes and I've set it to be on the same priz scale just align: start position: 0% set it to be on the same priz scale just align: start position: 0% set it to be on the same priz scale just so that we can see them easier and you align: start position: 0% so that we can see them easier and you align: start position: 0% so that we can see them easier and you can see for example in here the price of align: start position: 0% can see for example in here the price of align: start position: 0% can see for example in here the price of ethereum is actually lower than the align: start position: 0% ethereum is actually lower than the align: start position: 0% ethereum is actually lower than the price of ethereum classic but it becomes align: start position: 0% price of ethereum classic but it becomes align: start position: 0% price of ethereum classic but it becomes the opposite in here the price of align: start position: 0% the opposite in here the price of align: start position: 0% the opposite in here the price of ethereum is actually more than the price align: start position: 0% ethereum is actually more than the price align: start position: 0% ethereum is actually more than the price of ethereum classic so what does it mean align: start position: 0% of ethereum classic so what does it mean align: start position: 0% of ethereum classic so what does it mean it means that if we open the long align: start position: 0% it means that if we open the long align: start position: 0% it means that if we open the long position for ethereum at this point in align: start position: 0% position for ethereum at this point in align: start position: 0% position for ethereum at this point in time and at the same time open the short align: start position: 0% time and at the same time open the short align: start position: 0% time and at the same time open the short position for ethereum classic here and align: start position: 0% position for ethereum classic here and align: start position: 0% position for ethereum classic here and hold that position when we reach this align: start position: 0% hold that position when we reach this align: start position: 0% hold that position when we reach this point in time you can see that it's the align: start position: 0% point in time you can see that it's the align: start position: 0% point in time you can see that it's the opposite now the price of ethereum align: start position: 0% opposite now the price of ethereum align: start position: 0% opposite now the price of ethereum classic is lower than the price of align: start position: 0% classic is lower than the price of align: start position: 0% classic is lower than the price of ethereum so what does it mean it means align: start position: 0% ethereum so what does it mean it means align: start position: 0% ethereum so what does it mean it means that yes both the prices are lower than align: start position: 0% that yes both the prices are lower than align: start position: 0% that yes both the prices are lower than what it was at this point in time but if align: start position: 0% what it was at this point in time but if align: start position: 0% what it was at this point in time but if we opened two opposite side positions align: start position: 0% we opened two opposite side positions align: start position: 0% we opened two opposite side positions one long and the other one short at this align: start position: 0% one long and the other one short at this align: start position: 0% one long and the other one short at this point we would have made money why align: start position: 0% point we would have made money why align: start position: 0% point we would have made money why because our short position would have align: start position: 0% because our short position would have align: start position: 0% because our short position would have made more money than the amount that our align: start position: 0% made more money than the amount that our align: start position: 0% made more money than the amount that our long position lost so the difference align: start position: 0% long position lost so the difference align: start position: 0% long position lost so the difference between the panl of both positions would align: start position: 0% between the panl of both positions would align: start position: 0% between the panl of both positions would be our profit now if I go back in time align: start position: 0% be our profit now if I go back in time align: start position: 0% be our profit now if I go back in time you can find so many positions where align: start position: 0% you can find so many positions where align: start position: 0% you can find so many positions where this opportunity existed I'm going to align: start position: 0% this opportunity existed I'm going to align: start position: 0% this opportunity

you want to use jupyter notebooks with Jesse all you need to do align: start position: 0% notebooks with Jesse all you need to do align: start position: 0% notebooks with Jesse all you need to do is to make sure they are inside your align: start position: 0% is to make sure they are inside your align: start position: 0% is to make sure they are inside your Jesse project all right so my project is align: start position: 0% Jesse project all right so my project is align: start position: 0% Jesse project all right so my project is named but I have multiple Jupiter align: start position: 0% named but I have multiple Jupiter align: start position: 0% named but I have multiple Jupiter notebooks and this one is the one I'm align: start position: 0% notebooks and this one is the one I'm align: start position: 0% notebooks and this one is the one I'm going to use all right so first we need align: start position: 0% going to use all right so first we need align: start position: 0% going to use all right so first we need to select the kernel and I'm going to to align: start position: 0% to select the kernel and I'm going to to align: start position: 0% to select the kernel and I'm going to to select one which already has Jessi align: start position: 0% select one which already has Jessi align: start position: 0% select one which already has Jessi installed in it all right let's add a align: start position: 0% installed in it all right let's add a align: start position: 0% installed in it all right let's add a code block and first I'm going to import align: start position: 0% code block and first I'm going to import align: start position: 0% code block and first I'm going to import all the necessary packages so I'm going align: start position: 0% all the necessary packages so I'm going align: start position: 0% all the necessary packages so I'm going to say from Jesse import utils and the align: start position: 0% to say from Jesse import utils and the align: start position: 0% to say from Jesse import utils and the research module now the utils will give align: start position: 0% research module now the utils will give align: start position: 0% research module now the utils will give us some utility functions and the align: start position: 0% us some utility functions and the align: start position: 0% us some utility functions and the research module is used for importing align: start position: 0% research module is used for importing align: start position: 0% research module is used for importing data from the database or even running align: start position: 0% data from the database or even running align: start position: 0% data from the database or even running back test but I'm not going to use that align: start position: 0% back test but I'm not going to use that align: start position: 0% back test but I'm not going to use that in jupyter notebooks in this video but align: start position: 0% in jupyter notebooks in this video but align: start position: 0% in jupyter notebooks in this video but you can if you like to all right so next align: start position: 0% you can if you like to all right so next align: start position: 0% you can if you like to all right so next I'm going to import JC helpers as JH align: start position: 0% I'm going to import JC helpers as JH align: start position: 0% I'm going to import JC helpers as JH which will give me some helpers that align: start position: 0% which will give me some helpers that align: start position: 0% which will give me some helpers that aren't really used in most of the align: start position: 0% aren't really used in most of the align: start position: 0% aren't really used in most of the strategies but I'm going to use it in align: start position: 0% strategies but I'm going to use it in align: start position: 0% strategies but I'm going to use it in here next I will import numpy as MP from align: start position: 0% here next I will import numpy as MP from align: start position: 0% here next I will import numpy as MP from daytime I'm going to import daytime and align: start position: 0% daytime I'm going to import daytime and align: start position: 0% daytime I'm going to import daytime and lastly I'm going to import the Matt plot align: start position: 0% lastly I'm going to import the Matt plot align: start position: 0% lastly I'm going to import the Matt plot Li library because I'm going to show you align: start position: 0% Li library because I'm going to show you align: start position: 0% Li library because I'm going to show you some charts all right next I want to align: start position: 0% some charts all right next I want to align: start position: 0% some charts all right next I want to import some data and I'm going to use align:

get candles align: start position: 0% the research modules get candles function and first it will ask me the align: start position: 0% function and first it will ask me the align: start position: 0% function and first it will ask me the name of the exchange all right so let's align: start position: 0% name of the exchange all right so let's align: start position: 0% name of the exchange all right so let's def find the exchange variable here I'm align: start position: 0% def find the exchange variable here I'm align: start position: 0% def find the exchange variable here I'm going to use binance Perpetual Futures align: start position: 0% going to use binance Perpetual Futures align: start position: 0% going to use binance Perpetual Futures and here I will pass the exchange the align: start position: 0% and here I will pass the exchange the align: start position: 0% and here I will pass the exchange the second one is the symbol and I want to align: start position: 0% second one is the symbol and I want to align: start position: 0% second one is the symbol and I want to use eth and Etc which is ethereum align: start position: 0% use eth and Etc which is ethereum align: start position: 0% use eth and Etc which is ethereum classic all right so the first one is align: start position: 0% classic all right so the first one is align: start position: 0% classic all right so the first one is going to be e us and the time frame I align: start position: 0% going to be e us and the time frame I align: start position: 0% going to be e us and the time frame I want it to be 15 minutes and then we align: start position: 0% want it to be 15 minutes and then we align: start position: 0% want it to be 15 minutes and then we have the assort now the assort date that align: start position: 0% have the assort now the assort date that align: start position: 0% have the assort now the assort date that is accepted here has to be in time stamp align: start position: 0% is accepted here has to be in time stamp align: start position: 0% is accepted here has to be in time stamp format and to convert that I'm going to align: start position: 0% format and to convert that I'm going to align: start position: 0% format and to convert that I'm going to use use the helper function from Jesse align: start position: 0% use use the helper function from Jesse align: start position: 0% use use the helper function from Jesse so I'm going to say this start date align: start position: 0% so I'm going to say this start date align: start position: 0% so I'm going to say this start date equals and I'm going to use date to Tim align: start position: 0% equals and I'm going to use date to Tim align: start position: 0% equals and I'm going to use date to Tim stamp and in it I will pass the date align: start position: 0% stamp and in it I will pass the date align: start position: 0% stamp and in it I will pass the date since align: start position: 0% since align: start position: 0% since 2024 the month could be the 10th month align: start position: 0% 2024 the month could be the 10th month align: start position: 0% 2024 the month could be the 10th month and since the first day and for my align: start position: 0% and since the first day and for my align: start position: 0% and since the first day and for my finished date I'm going to give it again align: start position: 0% finished date I'm going to give it again align: start position: 0% finished date I'm going to give it again date to timestamp again 2024 10th month align: start position: 0% date to timestamp again 2024 10th month align: start position: 0% date to timestamp again 2024 10th month and the third day so I only want data align: start position: 0% and the third day so I only want data align: start position: 0% and the third day so I only want data for 2 days B basically all right so now align: start position: 0% for 2 days B basically all right so now align: start position: 0% for 2 days B basically all right so now I have the start date right and the align: start position: 0% I have the start date right and the align: start position: 0% I have the start date right and the Finish date all right so and I can leave align: start position: 0% Finish date all right so and I can leave align: start position: 0% Finish date all right so and I can leave the other ones all right now this align: start position: 0% the other ones all right now this align: start position: 0% the other ones all right now this function will return two values the align: start position: 0% function will return two values the align: start position: 0% function will return two values the warm-up candles and the actual candles align: start position: 0% warm-up candles and the actual candles align: start position: 0% warm-up candles and the actual candles that I want and because I don't intend align: start position: 0% that I want and because I don't intend align: start position: 0% that I want and because I don't intend to run back test with it in this Jupiter align: start position: 0% to run back test with it in this Jupiter align: start position: 0% to run back test with it in this Jupiter notebook I don't care about the value align: start position: 0% notebook I don't care about the value align: start position: 0% notebook I don't care about the value for the V candles right so I don't want align: start position: 0% for the V candles right so I don't want align: start position: 0% for the V candles right so I don't want the first one and that's why I'm using align: start position: 0% the first one and that's why I'm using align: start position: 0% the first one and that's why I'm using this underline value here but the second align: start position: 0% this underline value here but the second align: start position: 0% this underline value here but the second one I will call it C1 or candle one and align: start position: 0% one I will call it C1 or candle one and align: start position: 0% one I will call it C1 or candle one and there we go now for the second one we're align: start position: 0% there we go now for the second one we're align: start position: 0% there we go now for the second one we're going to do the same thing right except align: start position: 0% going to do the same thing right except align: start position: 0% going to do the same thing right except instead of eth we want it to be Etc all align: start position: 0% instead of eth we want it to be Etc all align: start position: 0% instead of eth we want it to be Etc all right let's run this and it's all good align: start position: 0% right let's run this and it's all good align: start position: 0% right let's run this and it's all good now next because I want to show you a align: start position: 0% now next because I want to show you a align: start position: 0% now next because I want to show you a chart of these values I'm going to need align: start position: 0% chart of these values I'm going to need align: start position: 0% chart of these values I'm going to need time stamps so I'm going to create an align: start position: 0% time stamps so I'm going to create an align: start position: 0% time stamps so I'm going to create an empty list called times and I'm going to align: start position: 0% empty list called times and I'm going to align: start position: 0% empty list called times and I'm going to Loop through the first set of candles align: start position: 0% Loop through the first set of candles align: start position: 0% Loop through the first set of candles right and in it I will simply say times align: start position: 0% right and in it I will simply say times align: start position: 0% right and in it I will simply say times do pend and date time do from time stamp align: start position: 0% do pend and date time do from time stamp align: start position: 0% do pend and date time do from time stamp and then I will pass the time stamp of align: start position: 0% and then I will pass the time stamp of align: start position: 0% and then I will pass the time stamp of each candle and that would be the first align: start position: 0% each candle and that would be the first align: start position: 0% each candle and that would be the first index but because this function expects align: start position: 0% index but because this function expects align: start position: 0% index but because this function expects the time samps to be in seconds but align: start position: 0% the time samps to be in seconds but align: start position: 0% the time samps to be in seconds but Jess's times samps are in milliseconds align: start position: 0% Jess's times samps are in milliseconds align: start position: 0% Jess's times samps are in milliseconds I'm going to have to divide this by align: start position: 0% I'm going to have to divide this by align: start position: 0% I'm going to have to divide this by 1, 000 all right there's one more thing I align: start position: 0% 1, 000 all right there's one more thing I align: start position: 0% 1, 000 all right there's one more thing I need to do just like this chart that I align: start position: 0% need to do just like this chart that I align: start position: 0% need to do just like this chart that I just showed you which both prices were align: start position: 0% just showed you which both prices were align: start position: 0% just showed you which both prices were on the same price scale because they align: start position: 0% on the same price scale because they align: start position: 0% on the same price scale because they weren't absolute values of prices they align: start position: 0% weren't absolute values of prices they align: start position: 0% weren't absolute values of prices they were price changes in matter of align: start position: 0% were price changes in matter of align: start position: 0% were price changes in matter of percentage right so we need to do the align: start position: 0% percentage right so we need to do the align: start position: 0% percentage right so we need to do the same in our python code so I'm going to align: start position: 0% same in our python code so I'm going to align: start position: 0% same in our python code so I'm going to say C1 equals use align: start position: 0% say C1 equals use align: start position: 0% say C1 equals use do prizes to returns and this is an align: start position: 0% do prizes to returns and this is an align: start position: 0% do prizes to returns and this is an already built-in function in Jesse so I align: start position: 0% already built-in function in Jesse so I align: start position: 0% already built-in function in Jesse so I don't have to Define it from scratch align: start position: 0% don't have to Define it from scratch align: start position: 0% don't have to Define it from scratch which is really nice so in it I'm going align: start position: 0% which is really nice so in it I'm going align: start position: 0% which is really nice so in it I'm going to have to pass all the candles but I align: start position: 0% to have to pass all the candles but I align: start position: 0% to have to pass all the candles but I only want the closing prizes and that align: start position: 0% only want the closing prizes and that align: start position: 0% only want the closing prizes and that would be C1 and I'm going to select all align: start position: 0% would be C1 and I'm going to select all align: start position: 0% would be C1 and I'm going to select all the candles but then I'm going to select align: start position: 0% the candles but then I'm going to select align: start position: 0% the candles but then I'm going to select only the closing candles and that would align: start position: 0% only the closing candles and that would align: start position: 0% only the closing candles and that would be the index of two so in case you align: start position: 0% be the index of two so in case you align: start position: 0% be the index of two so in case you didn't know the zero index in Jesse is align: start position: 0% didn't know the zero index in Jesse is align: start position: 0% didn't know the zero index in Jesse is timestamp and then we have the open align: start position: 0% timestamp and then we have the open align: start position: 0% timestamp and then we have the open close high low and then volume so the align: start position: 0% close high low and then volume so the align: start position: 0% close high low and then volume so the close would have an index of two and align: start position: 0% close would have an index of two and align: start position: 0% close would have an index of two and then I'm going to do the same thing for align: start position: 0% then I'm going to do the same thing for align: start position: 0% then I'm going to do the same thing for the second price data or ethereum align: start position: 0% the second price data or ethereum align: start position: 0% the second price data or ethereum classic right and we should also change align: start position: 0% classic right and we should also change align: start position: 0% classic right and we should also change this all right now we can run this one align: start position: 0% this all right now we can run this one align: start position: 0% this all right now we can run this one okay we're getting an error all right align: start position: 0% okay we're getting an error all right align: start position: 0% okay we're getting an error all right this shouldn't have been there it should align: start position: 0% this shouldn't have been there it should align: start position: 0% this shouldn't have been there it should have been inside here all right so now align: start position: 0% have been inside here all right so now align: start position: 0% have been inside here all right so now we can finally plot the actual price align: start position: 0% we can finally plot the actual price align: start position: 0% we can finally plot the actual price data and for that I'm going to say PLT align: start position: 0% data and for that I'm going to say PLT align: start position: 0% data and for that I'm going to say PLT figure which is used to set the size of align: start position: 0% figure which is used to set the size of align: start position: 0% figure which is used to set the size of the chart and in it I'm going to say fix align: start position: 0% the chart and in it I'm going to say fix align: start position: 0% the chart and in it I'm going to say fix size equals 15x 6 now this Size Doesn't align: start position: 0% size equals 15x 6 now this Size Doesn't align: start position: 0% size equals 15x 6 now this Size Doesn't Really Matter much it's just for align: start position: 0% Really Matter much it's just for align: start position: 0% Really Matter much it's just for presentation you can set whatever value align: start position: 0% presentation you can set whatever value align: start position: 0% presentation you can set whatever value you like next I'm going to say PLT do align: start position: 0% you like next I'm going to say PLT do align: start position: 0% you like next I'm going to say PLT do plot and I'm going to pass the time align: start position: 0% plot and I'm going to pass the time align: start position: 0% plot and I'm going to pass the time stamps and then the actual price data align: start position: 0% stamps and then the actual price data align: start position: 0% stamps and then the actual price data and for color I'm going to say blue and align: start position: 0% and for color I'm going to say blue and align: start position: 0% and for color I'm going to say blue and the label is going to be e next I will align: start position: 0% the label is going to be e next I will align: start position: 0% the label is going to be e next I will do the same thing for ethereum classic align: start position: 0% do the same thing for ethereum classic align: start position: 0% do the same thing for ethereum classic and I'm going to set the color as red align: start position: 0% and I'm going to set the color as red align: start position: 0% and I'm going to set the color as red and this should be TC and finally I can align: start position: 0% and this should be TC and finally I can align: start position: 0% and this should be TC and finally I can do pl. Legend to show me everything all align: start position: 0% do pl. Legend to show me everything all align: start position: 0% do pl. Legend to show me everything all right so now we can see the price data align: start position: 0% right so now we can see the price data align: start position: 0% right so now we can see the price data for both the assets on the same chart align: start position: 0% for both the assets on the same chart align: start position: 0% for both the assets on the same chart which is really cool now if you pay align: start position: 0% which is really cool now if you pay align: start position: 0% which is really cool now if you pay close attention you can see that our align: start position: 0% close attention you can see that our align: start position: 0% close attention you can see that our Theory very much sounds right in here align: start position: 0% Theory very much sounds right in here align: start position: 0% Theory very much sounds right in here for example the price of eth was lower align: start position: 0% for example the price of eth was lower align: start position: 0% for example the price of eth was lower than Etc but in here it was higher than align: start position: 0% than Etc but in here it was higher than align: start position: 0% than Etc but in here it was higher than that so in other words if we open the align: start position: 0% that so in other words if we open the align: start position: 0% that so in other words if we open the long position here and shorted the price align: start position: 0% long position here and shorted the price align: start position: 0% long position here and shorted the price of Etc and did the opposite in here we align: start position: 0% of Etc and did the opposite in here we align: start position: 0% of Etc and did the opposite in here we would have made money and the same goes align: start position: 0% would have made money and the same goes align: start position: 0% would have made money and the same goes for so many other places it goes here it align: start position: 0% for so many other places it goes here it align: start position: 0% for so many other places it goes here it goes here here here so it just continues align: start position: 0% goes here here here so it just continues align: start position: 0% goes here here here so it just continues right which is very promising all right align: start position: 0% right which is very promising all right align: start position: 0% right which is very promising all right so now that we have both of them on the align: start position: 0% so now that we have both of them on the align: start position: 0% so now that we have both of them on the same chart we should begin writing the align: start position: 0% same chart we should begin writing the align: start position: 0% same chart we should begin writing the actual code based on math that we can align: start position: 0% actual code based on math that we can align: start position: 0% actual code based on math that we can actually use to trade it right because align: start position: 0% actually use to trade it right because align: start position: 0% actually use to trade it right because we're not going to have the chart when align: start position: 0% we're not going to have the chart when align: start position: 0% we're not going to have the chart when we are trading this with a bot right now align: start position: 0% we are trading this with a bot right now align: start position: 0% we are trading this with a bot right now we're looking at this chart with our align: start position: 0% we're looking at this chart with our align: start position: 0% we're looking at this chart with our eyes that's how we know this happening align: start position: 0% eyes that's how we know this happening align: start position: 0% eyes that's how we know this happening so we need to use statistics to come up align: start position: 0% so we need to use statistics to come up align: start position: 0% so we need to use statistics to come up with a good strategy the first step is align: start position: 0% with a good strategy the first step is align: start position: 0% with a good strategy the first step is that we need the spread in other words align: start position: 0% that we need the spread in other words align: start position: 0% that we need the spread in other words we need the difference between the two align: start position: 0% we need the difference between the two align: start position: 0% we need the difference between the two price data so I'm going to define a align: start position: 0% price data so I'm going to define a align: start position: 0% price data so I'm going to define a spread as C1 and then I'm going to align: start position: 0% spread as C1 and then I'm going to align: start position: 0% spread as C1 and then I'm going to select since the first candle up until align: start position: 0% select since the first candle up until align: start position: 0% select since the first candle up until the end and the reason I'm doing this is align: start position: 0% the end and the reason I'm doing this is align: start position: 0% the end and the reason I'm doing this is how we defined this C1 variable we align: start position: 0% how we defined this C1 variable we align: start position: 0% how we defined this C1 variable we defined it in here we converted the align: start position: 0% defined it in here we converted the align: start position: 0% defined it in here we converted the candles into returns and when we did align: start position: 0% candles into returns and when we did align: start position: 0% candles into returns and when we did that the First Data actually became a align: start position: 0% that the First Data actually became a align: start position: 0% that the First Data actually became a nan value and that's why I'm doing this align: start position: 0% nan value and that's why I'm doing this align: start position: 0% nan value and that's why I'm doing this and if you don't believe me I can print align: start position: 0% and if you don't believe me I can print align: start position: 0% and if you don't believe me I can print this data so you can see it so let's align: start position: 0% this data so you can see it so let's align: start position: 0% this data so you can see it so let's print the first value and you see it is align: start position: 0% print the first value and you see it is align: start position: 0% print the first value and you see it is Nan right and we cannot really have that align: start position: 0% Nan right and we cannot really have that align: start position: 0% Nan right and we cannot really have that in our strategy so that's why I'm going align: start position: 0% in our strategy so that's why I'm going align: start position: 0% in our strategy so that's why I'm going to select since the first data and when align: start position: 0% to select since the first data and when align: start position: 0% to select since the first data and when I say first I mean the index of one align: start position: 0% I say first I mean the index of one align: start position: 0% I say first I mean the index of one because the actual first value would align: start position: 0% because the actual first value would align: start position: 0% because the actual first value would have the index of zero so we're going to align: start position: 0% have the index of zero so we're going to align: start position: 0% have the index of zero so we're going to select this one until the end minus C2 align: start position: 0% select this one until the end minus C2 align: start position: 0% select this one until the end minus C2 and again selecting since the first align: start position: 0% and again selecting since the first align: start position: 0% and again selecting since the first index up until the end right so this is align: start position: 0% index up until the end right so this is align: start position: 0% index up until the end right so this is going to be our spread which is the align: start position: 0% going to be our spread which is the align: start position: 0% going to be our spread which is the difference between the two price data align: start position: 0% difference between the two price data align: start position: 0% difference between the two price data now to actually take advantage of this align: start position: 0% now to actually take advantage of this align: start position: 0% now to actually take advantage of this data having the spread alone isn't align: start position: 0% data having the spread alone isn't align: start position: 0% data having the spread alone isn't enough we need the zcore of it now what align: start position: 0% enough we need the zcore of it now what align: start position: 0% enough we need the zcore of it now what is zcore the Z score is the price align: start position: 0% is zcore the Z score is the price align: start position: 0% is zcore the Z score is the price difference or the spread that we just align: start position: 0% difference or the spread that we just align: start position: 0% difference or the spread that we just defined compared to the mean of the align: start position: 0% defined compared to the mean of the align: start position: 0% defined compared to the mean of the price data and that's what we really align: start position: 0% price data and that's what we really align: start position: 0% price data and that's what we really care about so we're going to define the align: start position: 0% care about so we're going to define the align: start position: 0% care about so we're going to define the zscore now Jesse already has a utility align: start position: 0% zscore now Jesse already has a utility align: start position: 0% zscore now Jesse already has a utility function which will calculate the zscore align: start position: 0% function which will calculate the zscore align: start position: 0% function which will calculate the zscore for me so I'm going to use that one it's align: start position: 0% for me so I'm going to use that one it's align: start position: 0% for me so I'm going to use that one it's called zscore and it takes the series align: start position: 0% called zscore and it takes the series align: start position: 0% called zscore and it takes the series data or in this case it would be our align: start position: 0% data or in this case it would be our align: start position: 0% data or in this case it would be our spread now I'm going to also Define the align: start position: 0% spread now I'm going to also Define the align: start position: 0% spread now I'm going to also Define the mean now by the way the zcore function align: start position: 0% mean now by the way the zcore function align: start position: 0% mean now by the way the zcore function it will use the mean itself if you're align: start position: 0% it will use the mean itself if you're align: start position: 0% it will use the mean itself if you're curious to know how it works is it's align: start position: 0% curious to know how it works is it's align: start position: 0% curious to know how it works is it's basically this price series minus the align: start position: 0% basically this price series minus the align: start position: 0% basically this price series minus the mean of that price series divided by its align: start position: 0% mean of that price series divided by its align: start position: 0% mean of that price series divided by its standard deviation right now you don't align: start position: 0% standard deviation right now you don't align: start position: 0% standard deviation right now you don't have to know about the exact math behind align: start position: 0% have to know about the exact math behind align: start position: 0% have to know about the exact math behind it you could just use it but knowing it align: start position: 0% it you could just use it but knowing it align: start position: 0% it you could just use it but knowing it certainly helps all right so I am also align: start position: 0% certainly helps all right so I am also align: start position: 0% certainly helps all right so I am also going to define the mean of it myself align: start position: 0% going to define the mean of it myself align: start position: 0% going to define the mean of it myself because I want to print it on the chart align: start position: 0% because I want to print it on the chart align: start position: 0% because I want to print it on the chart and for that we can use numpy and we align: start position: 0% and for that we can use numpy and we align: start position: 0% and for that we can use numpy and we will just pass the zscore and now we can align: start position: 0% will just pass the zscore and now we can align: start position: 0% will just pass the zscore and now we can plot them right so first I'm going to align: start position: 0% plot them right so first I'm going to align: start position: 0% plot them right so first I'm going to say PLT align: start position: 0% say PLT align: start position: 0% say PLT figure and then pass the fix size just align: start position: 0% figure and then pass the fix size just align: start position: 0% figure and then pass the fix size just like before 15 and six next I'm going to align: start position: 0% like before 15 and six next I'm going to align: start position: 0% like before 15 and six next I'm going to say PLT plot and I'm going to pass the align: start position: 0% say PLT plot and I'm going to pass the align: start position: 0% say PLT plot and I'm going to pass the times again selecting since since the align: start position: 0% times again selecting since since the align: start position: 0% times again selecting since since the index of one to SK skip that Nan value align: start position: 0% index of one to SK skip that Nan value align: start position: 0% index of one to SK skip that Nan value and then I'm going to pass the zcore I'm align: start position: 0% and then I'm going to pass the zcore I'm align: start position: 0% and then I'm going to pass the zcore I'm going to set the color to Blue and the align: start position: 0% going to set the color to Blue and the align: start position: 0% going to set the color to Blue and the label could also be Z score next we're align: start position: 0% label could also be Z score next we're align: start position: 0% label could also be Z score next we're going to plot a horizontal line using align: start position: 0% going to plot a horizontal line using align: start position: 0% going to plot a horizontal line using this index and I'm going to pass the align: start position: 0% this index and I'm going to pass the align: start position: 0% this index and I'm going to pass the mean that we just defined here I'm going align: start position: 0% mean that we just defined here I'm going align: start position: 0% mean that we just defined here I'm going to use the color black and set the line align: start position: 0% to use the color black and set the line align: start position: 0% to use the color black and set the line Style to Dash and the label is going to align: start position: 0% Style to Dash and the label is going to align: start position: 0% Style to Dash and the label is going to be mean and then I'll do it two more align: start position: 0% be mean and then I'll do it two more align: start position: 0% be mean and then I'll do it two more times for the values of 1. 2 and minus align: start position: 0% times for the values of 1. 2 and minus align: start position: 0% times for the values of 1. 2 and minus 1. 2 with colors of red and green all align: start position: 0% 1. 2 with colors of red and green all align: start position: 0% 1. 2 with colors of red and green all right so let's see how this looks like align: start position: 0% right so let's see how this looks like align: start position: 0% right so let's see how this looks like and there we go so now we have the zore align: start position: 0% and there we go so now we have the zore align: start position: 0% and there we go so now we have the zore of the two price series and we can see align: start position: 0% of the two price series and we can see align: start position: 0% of the two price series and we can see how their correlation or the related align: start position: 0% how their correlation or the related align: start position: 0% how their correlation or the related price is actually moving so for example align: start position: 0% price is actually moving so for example align: start position: 0% price is actually moving so for example in here we can long the first asset and align: start position: 0% in here we can long the first asset and align: start position: 0% in here we can long the first asset and short the other one and when it reaches align: start position: 0% short the other one and when it reaches align: start position: 0% short the other one and when it reaches the mean we will just close the align: start position: 0% the mean we will just close the align: start position: 0% the mean we will just close the positions and we can do the opposite align: start position: 0% positions and we can do the opposite align: start position: 0% positions and we can do the opposite when the zscore goes above this line we align: start position: 0% when the zscore goes above this line we align: start position: 0% when the zscore goes above this line we can short the first asset and long the align: start position: 0% can short the first asset and long the align: start position: 0% can short the first asset and long the second one and again when it reaches the align: start position: 0% second one and again when it reaches the align: start position: 0% second one and again when it reaches the mean we can just close it right and and align: start position: 0% mean we can just close it right and and align: start position: 0% mean we can just close it right and and as you can see we had opportunities for align: start position: 0% as you can see we had opportunities for align: start position: 0% as you can see we had opportunities for this type of trade in more than once we align: start position: 0% this type of trade in more than once we align: start position: 0% this type of trade in more than once we had it here we had it here here here align: start position: 0% had it here we had it here here here align: start position: 0% had it here we had it here here here here here and so much more right so it align: start position: 0% here here and so much more right so it align: start position: 0% here here and so much more right so it looks very promising but here's the align: start position: 0% looks very promising but here's the align: start position: 0% looks very promising but here's the thing though right now we have this data align: start position: 0% thing though right now we have this data align: start position: 0% thing though right now we have this data honest beautiful chart which is only align: start position: 0% honest beautiful chart which is only align: start position: 0% honest beautiful chart which is only showing us the price data for two days align: start position: 0% showing us the price data for two days align: start position: 0% showing us the price data for two days but in reality we're not going to have align: start position: 0% but in reality we're not going to have align: start position: 0% but in reality we're not going to have charts we're going to trade this with a align: start position: 0% charts we're going to trade this with a align: start position: 0% charts we're going to trade this with a butt right so we need a statistical way align: start position: 0% butt right so we need a statistical way align: start position: 0% butt right so we need a statistical way to write all of these things but not align: start position: 0% to write all of these things but not align: start position: 0% to write all of these things but not only that we need to make sure these align: start position: 0% only that we need to make sure these align: start position: 0% only that we need to make sure these prizes are actually cointegrated now align: start position: 0% prizes are actually cointegrated now align: start position: 0% prizes are actually cointegrated now what is congration well again this video align: start position: 0% what is congration well again this video align: start position: 0% what is congration well again this video will describe it so much better but I'm align: start position: 0% will describe it so much better but I'm align: start position: 0% will describe it so much better but I'm also going to try my best you see to align: start position: 0% also going to try my best you see to align: start position: 0% also going to try my best you see to trade any mean verion strategy we need align: start position: 0% trade any mean verion strategy we need align: start position: 0% trade any mean verion strategy we need that price data to be stationary and align: start position: 0% that price data to be stationary and align: start position: 0% that price data to be stationary and what is a stationary well it means that align: start position: 0% what is a stationary well it means that align: start position: 0% what is a stationary well it means that the mean of that price data or data align: start position: 0% the mean of that price data or data align: start position: 0% the mean of that price data or data series is not moving now what is a align: start position: 0% series is not moving now what is a align: start position: 0% series is not moving now what is a stationary it means that the mean of the align: start position: 0% stationary it means that the mean of the align: start position: 0% stationary it means that the mean of the price data or data series is stable it's align: start position: 0% price data or data series is stable it's align: start position: 0% price data or data series is stable it's not changing because right now in this align: start position: 0% not changing because right now in this align: start position: 0% not changing because right now in this picture we know the mean is this but align: start position: 0% picture we know the mean is this but align: start position: 0% picture we know the mean is this but that's because we already have the price align: start position: 0% that's because we already have the price align: start position: 0% that's because we already have the price data for 2 days right so for example at align: start position: 0% data for 2 days right so for example at align: start position: 0% data for 2 days right so for example at this point in time the mean wouldn't align: start position: 0% this point in time the mean wouldn't align: start position: 0% this point in time the mean wouldn't exactly have been this value or at this align: start position: 0% exactly have been this value or at this align: start position: 0% exactly have been this value or at this point in time it wouldn't exactly have align: start position: 0% point in time it wouldn't exactly have align: start position: 0% point in time it wouldn't exactly have been that because we would would have align: start position: 0% been that because we would would have align: start position: 0% been that because we would would have calculated based on this much data right align: start position: 0% calculated based on this much data right align: start position: 0% calculated based on this much data right but now that we have all of it we align: start position: 0% but now that we have all of it we align: start position: 0% but now that we have all of it we already know what the mean of it is align: start position: 0% already know what the mean of it is align: start position: 0% already know what the mean of it is right so if I try to calculate the mean align: start position: 0% right so if I try to calculate the mean align: start position: 0% right so if I try to calculate the mean of this data series is going to change align: start position: 0% of this data series is going to change align: start position: 0% of this data series is going to change now we don't want it to be like stable align: start position: 0% now we don't want it to be like stable align: start position: 0% now we don't want it to be like stable 100% to be able to trade but the thing align: start position: 0% 100% to be able to trade but the thing align: start position: 0% 100% to be able to trade but the thing is if we try to trade a mean verion align: start position: 0% is if we try to trade a mean verion align: start position: 0% is if we try to trade a mean verion strategy on let's say just one asset we align: start position: 0% strategy on let's say just one asset we align: start position: 0% strategy on let's say just one asset we know for sure that it is not going to be align: start position: 0% know for sure that it is not going to be align: start position: 0% know for sure that it is not going to be a stationary however we can still trade align: start position: 0% a stationary however we can still trade align: start position: 0% a stationary however we can still trade them if they are conr and what does align: start position: 0% them if they are conr and what does align: start position: 0% them if they are conr and what does congration mean it means that yes these align: start position: 0% congration mean it means that yes these align: start position: 0% congration mean it means that yes these two price data even though individually align: start position: 0% two price data even though individually align: start position: 0% two price data even though individually they're not stationary some kind of align: start position: 0% they're not stationary some kind of align: start position: 0% they're not stationary some kind of combination of their price data which in align: start position: 0% combination of their price data which in align: start position: 0% combination of their price data which in this case would be the zcore that we align: start position: 0% this case would be the zcore that we align: start position: 0% this case would be the zcore that we just calculated that series is a align: start position: 0% just calculated that series is a align: start position: 0% just calculated that series is a stationary so that's what it means right align: start position: 0% stationary so that's what it means right align: start position: 0% stationary so that's what it means right and if that's the case then we can trade align: start position: 0% and if that's the case then we can trade align: start position: 0% and if that's the case then we can trade them against each other but if they're align: start position: 0% them against each other but if they're align: start position: 0% them against each other but if they're not we just can't now there are some align: start position: 0% not we just can't now there are some align: start position: 0% not we just can't now there are some statistical ways to calculate this but align: start position: 0% statistical ways to calculate this but align: start position: 0% statistical ways to calculate this but again Jesse gives us a utility function align: start position: 0% again Jesse gives us a utility function align: start position: 0% again Jesse gives us a utility function which will take care of this so I'm align: start position: 0% which will take care of this so I'm align: start position: 0% which will take care of this so I'm going to use that one so let's define a align: start position: 0% going to use that one so let's define a align: start position: 0% going to use that one so let's define a new variable called is cointegrated and align: start position: 0% new variable called is cointegrated and align: start position: 0% new variable called is cointegrated and in it we're going to use the r align: start position: 0% in it we're going to use the r align: start position: 0% in it we're going to use the r cointegrated utility function and first align: start position: 0% cointegrated utility function and first align: start position: 0% cointegrated utility function and first we will pass the first priz data and align: start position: 0% we will pass the first priz data and align: start position: 0% we will pass the first priz data and then the second now let's print this and align: start position: 0% then the second now let's print this and align: start position: 0% then the second now let's print this and it is returning true so now we know they align: start position: 0% it is returning true so now we know they align: start position: 0% it is returning true so now we know they are qur now if you're curious to know align: start position: 0% are qur now if you're curious to know align: start position: 0% are qur now if you're curious to know the source code of this well here it is align: start position: 0% the source code of this well here it is align: start position: 0% the source code of this well here it is we're using the set model module of align: start position: 0% we're using the set model module of align: start position: 0% we're using the set model module of python and then we use the P value and align: start position: 0% python and then we use the P value and align: start position: 0% python and then we use the P value and if it is below the cut of value we say align: start position: 0% if it is below the cut of value we say align: start position: 0% if it is below the cut of value we say it is cointegrated otherwise it's not align: start position: 0% it is cointegrated otherwise it's not align: start position: 0% it is cointegrated otherwise it's not now I know this sounds confusing but align: start position: 0% now I know this sounds confusing but align: start position: 0% now I know this sounds confusing but again watch that video of copian and align: start position: 0% again watch that video of copian and align: start position: 0% again watch that video of copian and hopefully it should make it clearer align: start position: 0% hopefully it should make it clearer align: start position: 0% hopefully it should make it clearer right now let's move on to Jesse so we align: start position: 0% right now let's move on to Jesse so we align: start position: 0% right now let's move on to Jesse so we can write the code in it so we can run align: start position: 0% can write the code in it so we can run align: start position: 0% can write the code in it so we can run some backst and see some actual numbers align: start position: 0% some backst and see some actual numbers align: start position: 0% some backst and see some actual numbers all right I'm going to start by align: start position: 0% all right I'm going to start by align: start position: 0% all right I'm going to start by generating a new strategy and I'm going align: start position: 0% generating a new strategy and I'm going align: start position: 0% generating a new strategy and I'm going to call it P align: start position: 0% to call it P align: start position: 0% to call it P trading all right so now I'm going to align: start position: 0% trading all right so now I'm going to align: start position: 0% trading all right so now I'm going to copy this and I will open my CER editor align: start position: 0% copy this and I will open my CER editor align: start position: 0% copy this and I will open my CER editor which uses Ai and is so much smarter and align: start position: 0% which uses Ai and is so much smarter and align: start position: 0% which uses Ai and is so much smarter and faster to use and I'm going to look for align: start position: 0% faster to use and I'm going to look for align: start position: 0% faster to use and I'm going to look for for this all right so this is the align: start position: 0% for this all right so this is the align: start position: 0% for this all right so this is the generated code now the real challenge align: start position: 0% generated code now the real challenge align: start position: 0% generated code now the real challenge for this strategy is that we cannot only align: start position: 0% for this strategy is that we cannot only align: start position: 0% for this strategy is that we cannot only Define it inside one strategy file align: start position: 0% Define it inside one strategy file align: start position: 0% Define it inside one strategy file because if I try to run a back test you align: start position: 0% because if I try to run a back test you align: start position: 0% because if I try to run a back test you see we have these routes and right now align: start position: 0% see we have these routes and right now align: start position: 0% see we have these routes and right now it is set to BC so let's change this to align: start position: 0% it is set to BC so let's change this to align: start position: 0% it is set to BC so let's change this to East UCC and the time frame to 15 align: start position: 0% East UCC and the time frame to 15 align: start position: 0% East UCC and the time frame to 15 minutes and this one to P trading all align: start position: 0% minutes and this one to P trading all align: start position: 0% minutes and this one to P trading all right and the duration is since align: start position: 0% right and the duration is since align: start position: 0% right and the duration is since beginning of this year until just if you align: start position: 0% beginning of this year until just if you align: start position: 0% beginning of this year until just if you days ago now here's the thing though we align: start position: 0% days ago now here's the thing though we align: start position: 0% days ago now here's the thing though we need to trade this for both eth and align: start position: 0% need to trade this for both eth and align: start position: 0% need to trade this for both eth and ethereum classic so I need to add align: start position: 0% ethereum classic so I need to add align: start position: 0% ethereum classic so I need to add another trading route and for this one align: start position: 0% another trading route and for this one align: start position: 0% another trading route and for this one I'm going to choose Etc and the same align: start position: 0% I'm going to choose Etc and the same align: start position: 0% I'm going to choose Etc and the same time frame but now we need to also pick align: start position: 0% time frame but now we need to also pick align: start position: 0% time frame but now we need to also pick another strategy so picking this one align: start position: 0% another strategy so picking this one align: start position: 0% another strategy so picking this one alone won't work so how do we do this align: start position: 0% alone won't work so how do we do this align: start position: 0% alone won't work so how do we do this now I need to generate another strategy align: start position: 0% now I need to generate another strategy align: start position: 0% now I need to generate another strategy and I can pick whichever name I like but align: start position: 0% and I can pick whichever name I like but align: start position: 0% and I can pick whichever name I like but I'm going to go with Paris trading two align: start position: 0% I'm going to go with Paris trading two align: start position: 0% I'm going to go with Paris trading two all right so I'm also going to open this align: start position: 0% all right so I'm also going to open this align: start position: 0% all right so I'm also going to open this one all right so now we're going to deal align: start position: 0% one all right so now we're going to deal align: start position: 0% one all right so now we're going to deal with two strategy files now I know you align: start position: 0% with two strategy files now I know you align: start position: 0% with two strategy files now I know you guys have some questions like how do we align: start position: 0% guys have some questions like how do we align: start position: 0% guys have some questions like how do we communicate between the two strategies align: start position: 0% communicate between the two strategies align: start position: 0% communicate between the two strategies how do we connect them to each other and align: start position: 0% how do we connect them to each other and align: start position: 0% how do we connect them to each other and I'm going to take care of the heavy align: start position: 0% I'm going to take care of the heavy align: start position: 0% I'm going to take care of the heavy lifting right now so let's connect these align: start position: 0% lifting right now so let's connect these align: start position: 0% lifting right now so let's connect these two strategies together so inside my align: start position: 0% two strategies together so inside my align: start position: 0% two strategies together so inside my first route I'm going to define the align: start position: 0% first route I'm going to define the align: start position: 0% first route I'm going to define the before function and in it I'm going to align: start position: 0% before function and in it I'm going to align: start position: 0% before function and in it I'm going to say if the current index is zero which align: start position: 0% say if the current index is zero which align: start position: 0% say if the current index is zero which means it's the beginning of the align: start position: 0% means it's the beginning of the align: start position: 0% means it's the beginning of the execution of the Strat align: start position: 0% execution of the Strat align: start position: 0% execution of the Strat I'm going to initiate two variables and align: start position: 0% I'm going to initiate two variables and align: start position: 0% I'm going to initiate two variables and I'm using this special dictionary align: start position: 0% I'm using this special dictionary align: start position: 0% I'm using this special dictionary variable inside Jesse called shared align: start position: 0% variable inside Jesse called shared align: start position: 0% variable inside Jesse called shared wordss now why is it called that it's align: start position: 0% wordss now why is it called that it's align: start position: 0% wordss now why is it called that it's called shared wordss as in whichever align: start position: 0% called shared wordss as in whichever align: start position: 0% called shared wordss as in whichever variable that you define in this align: start position: 0% variable that you define in this align: start position: 0% variable that you define in this dictionary is going to be shared among align: start position: 0% dictionary is going to be shared among align: start position: 0% dictionary is going to be shared among all the trading routes that you have and align: start position: 0% all the trading routes that you have and align: start position: 0% all the trading routes that you have and I'm calling the first one S1 position align: start position: 0% I'm calling the first one S1 position align: start position: 0% I'm calling the first one S1 position and I'm setting it to zero and then I align: start position: 0% and I'm setting it to zero and then I align: start position: 0% and I'm setting it to zero and then I Define another one for the second one align: start position: 0% Define another one for the second one align: start position: 0% Define another one for the second one and my shoot long is going to be very align: start position: 0% and my shoot long is going to be very align: start position: 0% and my shoot long is going to be very simple I'm going to say return true if align: start position: 0% simple I'm going to say return true if align: start position: 0% simple I'm going to say return true if the S1 position value equals one that's align: start position: 0% the S1 position value equals one that's align: start position: 0% the S1 position value equals one that's it and we're choosing one as in a long align: start position: 0% it and we're choosing one as in a long align: start position: 0% it and we're choosing one as in a long position so that means for a short align: start position: 0% position so that means for a short align: start position: 0% position so that means for a short position we need to do the opposite so align: start position: 0% position we need to do the opposite so align: start position: 0% position we need to do the opposite so that would be this right if the S1 align: start position: 0% that would be this right if the S1 align: start position: 0% that would be this right if the S1 position equals minus1 next I will take align: start position: 0% position equals minus1 next I will take align: start position: 0% position equals minus1 next I will take care of closing these positions and align: start position: 0% care of closing these positions and align: start position: 0% care of closing these positions and that's going to be using the update align: start position: 0% that's going to be using the update align: start position: 0% that's going to be using the update position method and in it I'm going to align: start position: 0% position method and in it I'm going to align: start position: 0% position method and in it I'm going to say if the value of S1 position equals align: start position: 0% say if the value of S1 position equals align: start position: 0% say if the value of S1 position equals zero I'm going to use the self. align: start position: 0% zero I'm going to use the self. align: start position: 0% zero I'm going to use the self. liquidate method to liquidate the align: start position: 0% liquidate method to liquidate the align: start position: 0% liquidate method to liquidate the current position for this trading route align: start position: 0% current position for this trading route align: start position: 0% current position for this trading route next I'm going to go to the second align: start position: 0% next I'm going to go to the second align: start position: 0% next I'm going to go to the second strategy and inside this shoong I'm align: start position: 0% strategy and inside this shoong I'm align: start position: 0% strategy and inside this shoong I'm going to say return if the shared vs align: start position: 0% going to say return if the shared vs align: start position: 0% going to say return if the shared vs S2 position equals 1 and we're going to align: start position: 0% S2 position equals 1 and we're going to align: start position: 0% S2 position equals 1 and we're going to do the opposite for a short position and align: start position: 0% do the opposite for a short position and align: start position: 0% do the opposite for a short position and again be careful with the key here it align: start position: 0% again be careful with the key here it align: start position: 0% again be careful with the key here it needs to be S2 because we're inside the align: start position: 0% needs to be S2 because we're inside the align: start position: 0% needs to be S2 because we're inside the second strategy and then I'm going to align: start position: 0% second strategy and then I'm going to align: start position: 0% second strategy and then I'm going to define the update position and do the align: start position: 0% define the update position and do the align: start position: 0% define the update position and do the opposite of what I did for the first align: start position: 0% opposite of what I did for the first align: start position: 0% opposite of what I did for the first strategy so I'm saying if the S2 align: start position: 0% strategy so I'm saying if the S2 align: start position: 0% strategy so I'm saying if the S2 position equals zero that means we need align: start position: 0% position equals zero that means we need align: start position: 0% position equals zero that means we need it to be closed so we will liquidate the align: start position: 0% it to be closed so we will liquidate the align: start position: 0% it to be closed so we will liquidate the current position right so next we have align: start position: 0% current position right so next we have align: start position: 0% current position right so next we have the position sizing so I'm going to back align: start position: 0% the position sizing so I'm going to back align: start position: 0% the position sizing so I'm going to back to the first route and inside the goong align: start position: 0% to the first route and inside the goong align: start position: 0% to the first route and inside the goong method I'm going to say this the align: start position: 0% method I'm going to say this the align: start position: 0% method I'm going to say this the quantity of my position is going to be align: start position: 0% quantity of my position is going to be align: start position: 0% quantity of my position is going to be the margin one which is this value that align: start position: 0% the margin one which is this value that align: start position: 0% the margin one which is this value that I'm going to Define for the the size of align: start position: 0% I'm going to Define for the the size of align: start position: 0% I'm going to Define for the the size of the position of the first position and align: start position: 0% the position of the first position and align: start position: 0% the position of the first position and I'm using this utility function called align: start position: 0% I'm using this utility function called align: start position: 0% I'm using this utility function called size to quantity which will take this as align: start position: 0% size to quantity which will take this as align: start position: 0% size to quantity which will take this as the first parameter and then the current align: start position: 0% the first parameter and then the current align: start position: 0% the first parameter and then the current price because I want to open the align: start position: 0% price because I want to open the align: start position: 0% price because I want to open the position with the market order and then align: start position: 0% position with the market order and then align: start position: 0% position with the market order and then I'm setting the trading fees and then align: start position: 0% I'm setting the trading fees and then align: start position: 0% I'm setting the trading fees and then all I need to do is to say self. buy align: start position: 0% all I need to do is to say self. buy align: start position: 0% all I need to do is to say self. buy equals quantity and then the current align: start position: 0% equals quantity and then the current align: start position: 0% equals quantity and then the current price to open a position using the align: start position: 0% price to open a position using the align: start position: 0% price to open a position using the current price and for the short position align: start position: 0% current price and for the short position align: start position: 0% current price and for the short position I'm going to do the opposite so again align: start position: 0% I'm going to do the opposite so again align: start position: 0% I'm going to do the opposite so again quantity equals align: start position: 0% quantity equals align: start position: 0% quantity equals this but instead of self. buy I'm align: start position: 0% this but instead of self. buy I'm align: start position: 0% this but instead of self. buy I'm passing self. sell equals quantity and align: start position: 0% passing self. sell equals quantity and align: start position: 0% passing self. sell equals quantity and then the current price all right so align: start position: 0% then the current price all right so align: start position: 0% then the current price all right so let's go to the second route align: start position: 0% let's go to the second route align: start position: 0% let's go to the second route and do the same thing here so I'm going align: start position: 0% and do the same thing here so I'm going align: start position: 0% and do the same thing here so I'm going to say Quantity equals this except that align: start position: 0% to say Quantity equals this except that align: start position: 0% to say Quantity equals this except that instead of margin one it needs to be align: start position: 0% instead of margin one it needs to be align: start position: 0% instead of margin one it needs to be margin two and then I will say s. buy align: start position: 0% margin two and then I will say s. buy align: start position: 0% margin two and then I will say s. buy equals quantity and then the current align: start position: 0% equals quantity and then the current align: start position: 0% equals quantity and then the current price and then for the go short position align: start position: 0% price and then for the go short position align: start position: 0% price and then for the go short position we'll do the same thing again ensure align: start position: 0% we'll do the same thing again ensure align: start position: 0% we'll do the same thing again ensure that this one is margin two and then align: start position: 0% that this one is margin two and then align: start position: 0% that this one is margin two and then instead of self. buy we have self. sell align: start position: 0% instead of self. buy we have self. sell align: start position: 0% instead of self. buy we have self. sell all right I don't know what you're align: start position: 0% all right I don't know what you're align: start position: 0% all right I don't know what you're thinking right now but if it's not clear align: start position: 0% thinking right now but if it's not clear align: start position: 0% thinking right now but if it's not clear yet don't worry cuz it's going to be in align: start position: 0% yet don't worry cuz it's going to be in align: start position: 0% yet don't worry cuz it's going to be in a second but all you need to know is align: start position: 0% a second but all you need to know is align: start position: 0% a second but all you need to know is that at this point these two strategy align: start position: 0% that at this point these two strategy align: start position: 0% that at this point these two strategy files are connected to each other so align: start position: 0% files are connected to each other so align: start position: 0% files are connected to each other so wherever we change these four variables align: start position: 0% wherever we change these four variables align: start position: 0% wherever we change these four variables the S1 position S2 position and S1 align: start position: 0% the S1 position S2 position and S1 align: start position: 0% the S1 position S2 position and S1 margin and S2 margin is going to take align: start position: 0% margin and S2 margin is going to take align: start position: 0% margin and S2 margin is going to take effect everywhere but now we need to align: start position: 0% effect everywhere but now we need to align: start position: 0% effect everywhere but now we need to define the logic of our strategy the one align: start position: 0% define the logic of our strategy the one align: start position: 0% define the logic of our strategy the one we just implemented inside this Jupiter align: start position: 0% we just implemented inside this Jupiter align: start position: 0% we just implemented inside this Jupiter notebook inside our first strategy so in align: start position: 0% notebook inside our first strategy so in align: start position: 0% notebook inside our first strategy so in fact I'm not going to touch the second align: start position: 0% fact I'm not going to touch the second align: start position: 0% fact I'm not going to touch the second strategy file at all anymore I'm align: start position: 0% strategy file at all anymore I'm align: start position: 0% strategy file at all anymore I'm completely done with it but for the align: start position: 0% completely done with it but for the align: start position: 0% completely done with it but for the first one let's begin all right so let's align: start position: 0% first one let's begin all right so let's align: start position: 0% first one let's begin all right so let's let's go back to the Jupiter notebook align: start position: 0% let's go back to the Jupiter notebook align: start position: 0% let's go back to the Jupiter notebook and here we were getting the candles align: start position: 0% and here we were getting the candles align: start position: 0% and here we were getting the candles like this using the research module but align: start position: 0% like this using the research module but align: start position: 0% like this using the research module but if I do it like this during a back test align: start position: 0% if I do it like this during a back test align: start position: 0% if I do it like this during a back test there's a good chance I'm going to use align: start position: 0% there's a good chance I'm going to use align: start position: 0% there's a good chance I'm going to use data from the future and we don't want align: start position: 0% data from the future and we don't want align: start position: 0% data from the future and we don't want that right because that would produce align: start position: 0% that right because that would produce align: start position: 0% that right because that would produce unrealistic results so instead I want to align: start position: 0% unrealistic results so instead I want to align: start position: 0% unrealistic results so instead I want to use Jess's built-in features for fishing align: start position: 0% use Jess's built-in features for fishing align: start position: 0% use Jess's built-in features for fishing the candles which insures we don't align: start position: 0% the candles which insures we don't align: start position: 0% the candles which insures we don't accidentally cause the liad bias in our align: start position: 0% accidentally cause the liad bias in our align: start position: 0% accidentally cause the liad bias in our strategy all right so I'm going to go align: start position: 0% strategy all right so I'm going to go align: start position: 0% strategy all right so I'm going to go back to the first strategy and I will align: start position: 0% back to the first strategy and I will align: start position: 0% back to the first strategy and I will Define a new property called C1 and in align: start position: 0% Define a new property called C1 and in align: start position: 0% Define a new property called C1 and in it I'm going to pass self. getet candles align: start position: 0% it I'm going to pass self. getet candles align: start position: 0% it I'm going to pass self. getet candles which is that built-in method for align: start position: 0% which is that built-in method for align: start position: 0% which is that built-in method for fishing the candles and again this one align: start position: 0% fishing the candles and again this one align: start position: 0% fishing the candles and again this one in Short you don't fish candles from the align: start position: 0% in Short you don't fish candles from the align: start position: 0% in Short you don't fish candles from the future Jesse will take care of it behind align: start position: 0% future Jesse will take care of it behind align: start position: 0% future Jesse will take care of it behind the scenes to only give you candles that align: start position: 0% the scenes to only give you candles that align: start position: 0% the scenes to only give you candles that you had at that point in time and the align: start position: 0% you had at that point in time and the align: start position: 0% you had at that point in time and the first parameter is the exchange and align: start position: 0% first parameter is the exchange and align: start position: 0% first parameter is the exchange and we're passing the current exchange and align: start position: 0% we're passing the current exchange and align: start position: 0% we're passing the current exchange and then the symbol now this one it could align: start position: 0% then the symbol now this one it could align: start position: 0% then the symbol now this one it could have Simply Be ET us right but because I align: start position: 0% have Simply Be ET us right but because I align: start position: 0% have Simply Be ET us right but because I wanted to Define it dynamically instead align: start position: 0% wanted to Define it dynamically instead align: start position: 0% wanted to Define it dynamically instead I I can use this self. rout and then I'm align: start position: 0% I I can use this self. rout and then I'm align: start position: 0% I I can use this self. rout and then I'm selecting the index of zero and then I'm align: start position: 0% selecting the index of zero and then I'm align: start position: 0% selecting the index of zero and then I'm selecting its symbol so this way no align: start position: 0% selecting its symbol so this way no align: start position: 0% selecting its symbol so this way no matter in back testing whichever symbol align: start position: 0% matter in back testing whichever symbol align: start position: 0% matter in back testing whichever symbol I choose here it will work here and I align: start position: 0% I choose here it will work here and I align: start position: 0% I choose here it will work here and I don't have to change anything so it's align: start position: 0% don't have to change anything so it's align: start position: 0% don't have to change anything so it's better now I'm also doing the same thing align: start position: 0% better now I'm also doing the same thing align: start position: 0% better now I'm also doing the same thing for time frame so I'm passing self. time align: start position: 0% for time frame so I'm passing self. time align: start position: 0% for time frame so I'm passing self. time frame which will give it whichever time align: start position: 0% frame which will give it whichever time align: start position: 0% frame which will give it whichever time frame that I pick here so instead of align: start position: 0% frame that I pick here so instead of align: start position: 0% frame that I pick here so instead of simply saying 15 minutes I'm using self. align: start position: 0% simply saying 15 minutes I'm using self. align: start position: 0% simply saying 15 minutes I'm using self. time frame and because I want only the align: start position: 0% time frame and because I want only the align: start position: 0% time frame and because I want only the closing price I as I showed you earlier align: start position: 0% closing price I as I showed you earlier align: start position: 0% closing price I as I showed you earlier in the jupyter notebooks I'm selecting align: start position: 0% in the jupyter notebooks I'm selecting align: start position: 0% in the jupyter notebooks I'm selecting all of them but only the closing prices align: start position: 0% all of them but only the closing prices align: start position: 0% all of them but only the closing prices which has the index of two but I'm also align: start position: 0% which has the index of two but I'm also align: start position: 0% which has the index of two but I'm also selecting only the last 200 candles and align: start position: 0% selecting only the last 200 candles and align: start position: 0% selecting only the last 200 candles and why is that well in the jupyter notebook align: start position: 0% why is that well in the jupyter notebook align: start position: 0% why is that well in the jupyter notebook we only had candles for 2 days right but align: start position: 0% we only had candles for 2 days right but align: start position: 0% we only had candles for 2 days right but when we are back testing let's say we align: start position: 0% when we are back testing let's say we align: start position: 0% when we are back testing let's say we want to back test it on multiple months align: start position: 0% want to back test it on multiple months align: start position: 0% want to back test it on multiple months if you give it so much data the mean of align: start position: 0% if you give it so much data the mean of align: start position: 0% if you give it so much data the mean of this data series is going to change a align: start position: 0% this data series is going to change a align: start position: 0% this data series is going to change a lot and it's not going to even be align: start position: 0% lot and it's not going to even be align: start position: 0% lot and it's not going to even be remotely what we need it to be so I want align: start position: 0% remotely what we need it to be so I want align: start position: 0% remotely what we need it to be so I want to make sure that we we catch the align: start position: 0% to make sure that we we catch the align: start position: 0% to make sure that we we catch the pattern of only the most recent data and align: start position: 0% pattern of only the most recent data and align: start position: 0% pattern of only the most recent data and that could be the last 2 days 3 days align: start position: 0% that could be the last 2 days 3 days align: start position: 0% that could be the last 2 days 3 days whatever but the point is it has to be a align: start position: 0% whatever but the point is it has to be a align: start position: 0% whatever but the point is it has to be a static number and I chose 200 you can align: start position: 0% static number and I chose 200 you can align: start position: 0% static number and I chose 200 you can try any other number and see whichever align: start position: 0% try any other number and see whichever align: start position: 0% try any other number and see whichever works best for you all right so now align: start position: 0% works best for you all right so now align: start position: 0% works best for you all right so now let's define another one and call it C2 align: start position: 0% let's define another one and call it C2 align: start position: 0% let's define another one and call it C2 which is going to be very similar except align: start position: 0% which is going to be very similar except align: start position: 0% which is going to be very similar except we're selecting the second route by align: start position: 0% we're selecting the second route by align: start position: 0% we're selecting the second route by using the index one and everything else align: start position: 0% using the index one and everything else align: start position: 0% using the index one and everything else is the rest so you see inside my first align: start position: 0% is the rest so you see inside my first align: start position: 0% is the rest so you see inside my first strategy file I have access to the data align: start position: 0% strategy file I have access to the data align: start position: 0% strategy file I have access to the data or everything from even the second align: start position: 0% or everything from even the second align: start position: 0% or everything from even the second strategy so that's why I said I'm not align: start position: 0% strategy so that's why I said I'm not align: start position: 0% strategy so that's why I said I'm not going to touch the second strategy file align: start position: 0% going to touch the second strategy file align: start position: 0% going to touch the second strategy file at all all right now let's define the align: start position: 0% at all all right now let's define the align: start position: 0% at all all right now let's define the zcore right so first we need the align: start position: 0% zcore right so first we need the align: start position: 0% zcore right so first we need the spread and that is going to be self. C1 align: start position: 0% spread and that is going to be self. C1 align: start position: 0% spread and that is going to be self. C1 minus self. C2 and again we're selecting align: start position: 0% minus self. C2 and again we're selecting align: start position: 0% minus self. C2 and again we're selecting from the index of one until the end align: start position: 0% from the index of one until the end align: start position: 0% from the index of one until the end which again is what I just did inside align: start position: 0% which again is what I just did inside align: start position: 0% which again is what I just did inside the Jupiter notebook and then I'm we align: start position: 0% the Jupiter notebook and then I'm we align: start position: 0% the Jupiter notebook and then I'm we going to say zscore equals utils zscore align: start position: 0% going to say zscore equals utils zscore align: start position: 0% going to say zscore equals utils zscore and I'm passing the spread and in the align: start position: 0% and I'm passing the spread and in the align: start position: 0% and I'm passing the spread and in the end I'm returning zscore minus one which align: start position: 0% end I'm returning zscore minus one which align: start position: 0% end I'm returning zscore minus one which will give me the last item inside this align: start position: 0% will give me the last item inside this align: start position: 0% will give me the last item inside this array and that's going to be the only align: start position: 0% array and that's going to be the only align: start position: 0% array and that's going to be the only one that I care about cuz it's not like align: start position: 0% one that I care about cuz it's not like align: start position: 0% one that I care about cuz it's not like I want to paint a chart with it right align: start position: 0% I want to paint a chart with it right align: start position: 0% I want to paint a chart with it right right so where do we Define the logic of align: start position: 0% right so where do we Define the logic of align: start position: 0% right so where do we Define the logic of the strategy or the rest of it now align: start position: 0% the strategy or the rest of it now align: start position: 0% the strategy or the rest of it now everything else will happen inside the align: start position: 0% everything else will happen inside the align: start position: 0% everything else will happen inside the before function now by the way in case align: start position: 0% before function now by the way in case align: start position: 0% before function now by the way in case you didn't know the before function is align: start position: 0% you didn't know the before function is align: start position: 0% you didn't know the before function is the first method inside the strategy align: start position: 0% the first method inside the strategy align: start position: 0% the first method inside the strategy cycle of J that we get called so align: start position: 0% cycle of J that we get called so align: start position: 0% cycle of J that we get called so whichever value that we set inside the align: start position: 0% whichever value that we set inside the align: start position: 0% whichever value that we set inside the before function is going to be align: start position: 0% before function is going to be align: start position: 0% before function is going to be accessible inside everything else inside align: start position: 0% accessible inside everything else inside align: start position: 0% accessible inside everything else inside the shoot long the go long the update align: start position: 0% the shoot long the go long the update align: start position: 0% the shoot long the go long the update position everything so that's why I'm align: start position: 0% position everything so that's why I'm align: start position: 0% position everything so that's why I'm doing all the decision makings inside align: start position: 0% doing all the decision makings inside align: start position: 0% doing all the decision makings inside this one and then setting the decisions align: start position: 0% this one and then setting the decisions align: start position: 0% this one and then setting the decisions inside these variables and then I'm align: start position: 0% inside these variables and then I'm align: start position: 0% inside these variables and then I'm checking for the result of those align: start position: 0% checking for the result of those align: start position: 0% checking for the result of those variables like for example in here all align: start position: 0% variables like for example in here all align: start position: 0% variables like for example in here all right now let's continue so once every align: start position: 0% right now let's continue so once every align: start position: 0% right now let's continue so once every 24 hours or one day I want to align: start position: 0% 24 hours or one day I want to align: start position: 0% 24 hours or one day I want to recalculate everything like I want to align: start position: 0% recalculate everything like I want to align: start position: 0% recalculate everything like I want to see if the pairs are still Co integrated align: start position: 0% see if the pairs are still Co integrated align: start position: 0% see if the pairs are still Co integrated or things like that so I'm going to say align: start position: 0% or things like that so I'm going to say align: start position: 0% or things like that so I'm going to say this if self index equals 0 which means align: start position: 0% this if self index equals 0 which means align: start position: 0% this if self index equals 0 which means in the beginning or if the remainder of align: start position: 0% in the beginning or if the remainder of align: start position: 0% in the beginning or if the remainder of self. index divided by one day worth of align: start position: 0% self. index divided by one day worth of align: start position: 0% self. index divided by one day worth of one minute candles and we can get that align: start position: 0% one minute candles and we can get that align: start position: 0% one minute candles and we can get that by saying 24 multiped by 60 divided by align: start position: 0% by saying 24 multiped by 60 divided by align: start position: 0% by saying 24 multiped by 60 divided by this number here right now what is this align: start position: 0% this number here right now what is this align: start position: 0% this number here right now what is this number because we're using the 15 align: start position: 0% number because we're using the 15 align: start position: 0% number because we're using the 15 minutes this is basically 15 but as it align: start position: 0% minutes this is basically 15 but as it align: start position: 0% minutes this is basically 15 but as it was the case with whichever whatever I align: start position: 0% was the case with whichever whatever I align: start position: 0% was the case with whichever whatever I did here so instead of hard coding I was align: start position: 0% did here so instead of hard coding I was align: start position: 0% did here so instead of hard coding I was using Dynamic values so that if we align: start position: 0% using Dynamic values so that if we align: start position: 0% using Dynamic values so that if we change something inside the js's align: start position: 0% change something inside the js's align: start position: 0% change something inside the js's dashboard it will take effect here right align: start position: 0% dashboard it will take effect here right align: start position: 0% dashboard it will take effect here right so because of that instead of Simply align: start position: 0% so because of that instead of Simply align: start position: 0% so because of that instead of Simply dividing it by 15 I'm going to divide it align: start position: 0% dividing it by 15 I'm going to divide it align: start position: 0% dividing it by 15 I'm going to divide it by this value I'm using the utility align: start position: 0% by this value I'm using the utility align: start position: 0% by this value I'm using the utility module again and the function time frame align: start position: 0% module again and the function time frame align: start position: 0% module again and the function time frame to 1 minute and then I'm passing the align: start position: 0% to 1 minute and then I'm passing the align: start position: 0% to 1 minute and then I'm passing the current time frame which is 15 minutes align: start position: 0% current time frame which is 15 minutes align: start position: 0% current time frame which is 15 minutes and it is returning 15 now I'm saying if align: start position: 0% and it is returning 15 now I'm saying if align: start position: 0% and it is returning 15 now I'm saying if the remainder of this division is zero align: start position: 0% the remainder of this division is zero align: start position: 0% the remainder of this division is zero that means it has passed 24 hours then I align: start position: 0% that means it has passed 24 hours then I align: start position: 0% that means it has passed 24 hours then I want to check for qution is qug grated align: start position: 0% want to check for qution is qug grated align: start position: 0% want to check for qution is qug grated equals utils do R cointegrated and then align: start position: 0% equals utils do R cointegrated and then align: start position: 0% equals utils do R cointegrated and then I'm passing the first set of price align: start position: 0% I'm passing the first set of price align: start position: 0% I'm passing the first set of price returns and then I'm passing the second align: start position: 0% returns and then I'm passing the second align: start position: 0% returns and then I'm passing the second one and if they are not going integrated align: start position: 0% one and if they are not going integrated align: start position: 0% one and if they are not going integrated anymore I want to close all the align: start position: 0% anymore I want to close all the align: start position: 0% anymore I want to close all the positions and I can do that by setting align: start position: 0% positions and I can do that by setting align: start position: 0% positions and I can do that by setting both these values S1 position and S2 align: start position: 0% both these values S1 position and S2 align: start position: 0% both these values S1 position and S2 position to zero all right now let's align: start position: 0% position to zero all right now let's align: start position: 0% position to zero all right now let's move on next we're going to define the align: start position: 0% move on next we're going to define the align: start position: 0% move on next we're going to define the zscore and we can simply get that using align: start position: 0% zscore and we can simply get that using align: start position: 0% zscore and we can simply get that using the self. Z score which we defined in align: start position: 0% the self. Z score which we defined in align: start position: 0% the self. Z score which we defined in here right so let's get that one now I'm align: start position: 0% here right so let's get that one now I'm align: start position: 0% here right so let's get that one now I'm going to say if the current position is align: start position: 0% going to say if the current position is align: start position: 0% going to say if the current position is closed and we can simply get that using align: start position: 0% closed and we can simply get that using align: start position: 0% closed and we can simply get that using this and the align: start position: 0% this and the align: start position: 0% this and the zcore is below the threshold that we align: start position: 0% zcore is below the threshold that we align: start position: 0% zcore is below the threshold that we Define in here you remember these two align: start position: 0% Define in here you remember these two align: start position: 0% Define in here you remember these two lines it was align: start position: 0% lines it was align: start position: 0% lines it was 1. 2 and minus 1. 2 so I'm going to use align: start position: 0% 1. 2 and minus 1. 2 so I'm going to use align: start position: 0% 1. 2 and minus 1. 2 so I'm going to use that here so if the zcore is below minus align: start position: 0% that here so if the zcore is below minus align: start position: 0% that here so if the zcore is below minus 1 2 then I'm going to say go long with align: start position: 0% 1 2 then I'm going to say go long with align: start position: 0% 1 2 then I'm going to say go long with the first position by simply setting it align: start position: 0% the first position by simply setting it align: start position: 0% the first position by simply setting it to one and go short the second position align: start position: 0% to one and go short the second position align: start position: 0% to one and go short the second position by simply setting it to minus one now align: start position: 0% by simply setting it to minus one now align: start position: 0% by simply setting it to minus one now next I'm going to say let's remove this align: start position: 0% next I'm going to say let's remove this align: start position: 0% next I'm going to say let's remove this next I'm going to say else if it is align: start position: 0% next I'm going to say else if it is align: start position: 0% next I'm going to say else if it is already long but the Z score is above align: start position: 0% already long but the Z score is above align: start position: 0% already long but the Z score is above zero now in other words so you remember align: start position: 0% zero now in other words so you remember align: start position: 0% zero now in other words so you remember this we went long here but once it align: start position: 0% this we went long here but once it align: start position: 0% this we went long here but once it reaches the mean we want to close the align: start position: 0% reaches the mean we want to close the align: start position: 0% reaches the mean we want to close the position so I'm going to say if the Z is align: start position: 0% position so I'm going to say if the Z is align: start position: 0% position so I'm going to say if the Z is is now above zero set this one to zero align: start position: 0% is now above zero set this one to zero align: start position: 0% is now above zero set this one to zero and also this one all right so both align: start position: 0% and also this one all right so both align: start position: 0% and also this one all right so both positions need to be zero or closed and align: start position: 0% positions need to be zero or closed and align: start position: 0% positions need to be zero or closed and next I'm going to say if it's a short align: start position: 0% next I'm going to say if it's a short align: start position: 0% next I'm going to say if it's a short position and the Z score is below zero align: start position: 0% position and the Z score is below zero align: start position: 0% position and the Z score is below zero and that would be this case so if we align: start position: 0% and that would be this case so if we align: start position: 0% and that would be this case so if we went short but the mean is now below the align: start position: 0% went short but the mean is now below the align: start position: 0% went short but the mean is now below the mean then again close both positions and align: start position: 0% mean then again close both positions and align: start position: 0% mean then again close both positions and lastly I'm going to say else if it is align: start position: 0% lastly I'm going to say else if it is align: start position: 0% lastly I'm going to say else if it is closed but the zcore is above 1. 2 which align: start position: 0% closed but the zcore is above 1. 2 which align: start position: 0% closed but the zcore is above 1. 2 which would be this case I want to short the align: start position: 0% would be this case I want to short the align: start position: 0% would be this case I want to short the first position and long the second align: start position: 0% first position and long the second align: start position: 0% first position and long the second position all right now we have the align: start position: 0% position all right now we have the align: start position: 0% position all right now we have the decision- making of our strategy we know align: start position: 0% decision- making of our strategy we know align: start position: 0% decision- making of our strategy we know when exactly it's going to go long and align: start position: 0% when exactly it's going to go long and align: start position: 0% when exactly it's going to go long and when is going to go short however we're align: start position: 0% when is going to go short however we're align: start position: 0% when is going to go short however we're still missing one variable and that is align: start position: 0% still missing one variable and that is align: start position: 0% still missing one variable and that is the size of the position and this is align: start position: 0% the size of the position and this is align: start position: 0% the size of the position and this is really important because the bigger the align: start position: 0% really important because the bigger the align: start position: 0% really important because the bigger the size of the market cap of an asset the align: start position: 0% size of the market cap of an asset the align: start position: 0% size of the market cap of an asset the less volatile it will be so in our case align: start position: 0% less volatile it will be so in our case align: start position: 0% less volatile it will be so in our case we already know that the price of align: start position: 0% we already know that the price of align: start position: 0% we already know that the price of ethereum will move less than the price align: start position: 0% ethereum will move less than the price align: start position: 0% ethereum will move less than the price of ethereum classic so let's say they align: start position: 0% of ethereum classic so let's say they align: start position: 0% of ethereum classic so let's say they are moving exactly at the same time if align: start position: 0% are moving exactly at the same time if align: start position: 0% are moving exactly at the same time if only the size of the positions are align: start position: 0% only the size of the positions are align: start position: 0% only the size of the positions are exactly the same for example if we long align: start position: 0% exactly the same for example if we long align: start position: 0% exactly the same for example if we long one of them with $1, 000 and short the align: start position: 0% one of them with $1, 000 and short the align: start position: 0% one of them with $1, 000 and short the other one with $1, 000 when they move align: start position: 0% other one with $1, 000 when they move align: start position: 0% other one with $1, 000 when they move let's say they both go up it's still the align: start position: 0% let's say they both go up it's still the align: start position: 0% let's say they both go up it's still the one with the lower market cap which align: start position: 0% one with the lower market cap which align: start position: 0% one with the lower market cap which would be ethereum classic in this case align: start position: 0% would be ethereum classic in this case align: start position: 0% would be ethereum classic in this case and that means if it was the long align: start position: 0% and that means if it was the long align: start position: 0% and that means if it was the long position we're going to be in profit but align: start position: 0% position we're going to be in profit but align: start position: 0% position we're going to be in profit but if it was the short position we would align: start position: 0% if it was the short position we would align: start position: 0% if it was the short position we would lose money right and that's not what we align: start position: 0% lose money right and that's not what we align: start position: 0% lose money right and that's not what we want so we need to make sure the size of align: start position: 0% want so we need to make sure the size of align: start position: 0% want so we need to make sure the size of these positions are not exactly the same align: start position: 0% these positions are not exactly the same align: start position: 0% these positions are not exactly the same value but they are somehow equal in align: start position: 0% value but they are somehow equal in align: start position: 0% value but they are somehow equal in matter of like how much money money we align: start position: 0% matter of like how much money money we align: start position: 0% matter of like how much money money we would make or lose between them right align: start position: 0% would make or lose between them right align: start position: 0% would make or lose between them right now how do we do that so first I'm going align: start position: 0% now how do we do that so first I'm going align: start position: 0% now how do we do that so first I'm going to define a new function and I'm going align: start position: 0% to define a new function and I'm going align: start position: 0% to define a new function and I'm going to call it set proper margin per align: start position: 0% to call it set proper margin per align: start position: 0% to call it set proper margin per route all right and I'm going to call align: start position: 0% route all right and I'm going to call align: start position: 0% route all right and I'm going to call this firstly in here and second in here align: start position: 0% this firstly in here and second in here align: start position: 0% this firstly in here and second in here so again this is where we opened the align: start position: 0% so again this is where we opened the align: start position: 0% so again this is where we opened the first long position and the second short align: start position: 0% first long position and the second short align: start position: 0% first long position and the second short position and this is where we did the align: start position: 0% position and this is where we did the align: start position: 0% position and this is where we did the opposite right and these two were we align: start position: 0% opposite right and these two were we align: start position: 0% opposite right and these two were we were just closing an already open align: start position: 0% were just closing an already open align: start position: 0% were just closing an already open position now this is incorrect going to align: start position: 0% position now this is incorrect going to align: start position: 0% position now this is incorrect going to remove it now to calculate this I'm align: start position: 0% remove it now to calculate this I'm align: start position: 0% remove it now to calculate this I'm going to use a formula which again align: start position: 0% going to use a formula which again align: start position: 0% going to use a formula which again luckily Jesse provides us so we're going align: start position: 0% luckily Jesse provides us so we're going align: start position: 0% luckily Jesse provides us so we're going to get the alpha but I'm not going to align: start position: 0% to get the alpha but I'm not going to align: start position: 0% to get the alpha but I'm not going to use the alpha so I'm just going to pass align: start position: 0% use the alpha so I'm just going to pass align: start position: 0% use the alpha so I'm just going to pass an underline and then the beta and is align: start position: 0% an underline and then the beta and is align: start position: 0% an underline and then the beta and is going to equal utils do calculate Alpha align: start position: 0% going to equal utils do calculate Alpha align: start position: 0% going to equal utils do calculate Alpha Beta And this is this formula so we're align: start position: 0% Beta And this is this formula so we're align: start position: 0% Beta And this is this formula so we're using the assets model again right and align: start position: 0% using the assets model again right and align: start position: 0% using the assets model again right and this is the formula so the x equals add align: start position: 0% this is the formula so the x equals add align: start position: 0% this is the formula so the x equals add constant then we're passing the second align: start position: 0% constant then we're passing the second align: start position: 0% constant then we're passing the second returns and we're using a model to do align: start position: 0% returns and we're using a model to do align: start position: 0% returns and we're using a model to do linear regression I think and then that align: start position: 0% linear regression I think and then that align: start position: 0% linear regression I think and then that will give us the Alpha and the beta and align: start position: 0% will give us the Alpha and the beta and align: start position: 0% will give us the Alpha and the beta and then we are passing them I'm not going align: start position: 0% then we are passing them I'm not going align: start position: 0% then we are passing them I'm not going to go through the exact math behind it align: start position: 0% to go through the exact math behind it align: start position: 0% to go through the exact math behind it again if you want to just watch that align: start position: 0% again if you want to just watch that align: start position: 0% again if you want to just watch that video from quantopian which they do align: start position: 0% video from quantopian which they do align: start position: 0% video from quantopian which they do explain this better now this is giving align: start position: 0% explain this better now this is giving align: start position: 0% explain this better now this is giving us both the Alpha and the beta to align: start position: 0% us both the Alpha and the beta to align: start position: 0% us both the Alpha and the beta to calculate the margin I'm using the align: start position: 0% calculate the margin I'm using the align: start position: 0% calculate the margin I'm using the current available margin multiplied by 1 align: start position: 0% current available margin multiplied by 1 align: start position: 0% current available margin multiplied by 1 ided by 1 + beta and for the second align: start position: 0% ided by 1 + beta and for the second align: start position: 0% ided by 1 + beta and for the second margin or the margin of the second align: start position: 0% margin or the margin of the second align: start position: 0% margin or the margin of the second position or the second strategy I'm align: start position: 0% position or the second strategy I'm align: start position: 0% position or the second strategy I'm using it like this now to be honest with align: start position: 0% using it like this now to be honest with align: start position: 0% using it like this now to be honest with you I'm not a math wizard myself and I align: start position: 0% you I'm not a math wizard myself and I align: start position: 0% you I'm not a math wizard myself and I use chat GPT heavily for writing this align: start position: 0% use chat GPT heavily for writing this align: start position: 0% use chat GPT heavily for writing this part but because I did a lot of testing align: start position: 0% part but because I did a lot of testing align: start position: 0% part but because I did a lot of testing I know it's actually working so sorry if align: start position: 0% I know it's actually working so sorry if align: start position: 0% I know it's actually working so sorry if I cannot explain this any better all align: start position: 0% I cannot explain this any better all align: start position: 0% I cannot explain this any better all right so that's it now we have the align: start position: 0% right so that's it now we have the align: start position: 0% right so that's it now we have the margin one the margin 2 and the values align: start position: 0% margin one the margin 2 and the values align: start position: 0% margin one the margin 2 and the values for S1 position and S2 position and now align: start position: 0% for S1 position and S2 position and now align: start position: 0% for S1 position and S2 position and now we're ready to execute our first align: start position: 0% we're ready to execute our first align: start position: 0% we're ready to execute our first practice so let's go back to Jesse and align: start position: 0% practice so let's go back to Jesse and align: start position: 0% practice so let's go back to Jesse and we have both the trading routes eth Etc align: start position: 0% we have both the trading routes eth Etc align: start position: 0% we have both the trading routes eth Etc the 15 minutes time frame P trading is align: start position: 0% the 15 minutes time frame P trading is align: start position: 0% the 15 minutes time frame P trading is selected but the second one also needs align: start position: 0% selected but the second one also needs align: start position: 0% selected but the second one also needs to be press rating two and the duration align: start position: 0% to be press rating two and the duration align: start position: 0% to be press rating two and the duration make sure the fast mode is off because align: start position: 0% make sure the fast mode is off because align: start position: 0% make sure the fast mode is off because it actually cannot work with multiple align: start position: 0% it actually cannot work with multiple align: start position: 0% it actually cannot work with multiple routes yet so if I try to start it here align: start position: 0% routes yet so if I try to start it here align: start position: 0% routes yet so if I try to start it here I'm going to get an error so let's turn align: start position: 0% I'm going to get an error so let's turn align: start position: 0% I'm going to get an error so let's turn this off and I'm going to leave the align: start position: 0% this off and I'm going to leave the align: start position: 0% this off and I'm going to leave the actually let's turn off The Benchmark align: start position: 0% actually let's turn off The Benchmark align: start position: 0% actually let's turn off The Benchmark first and let's run it all right so this align: start position: 0% first and let's run it all right so this align: start position: 0% first and let's run it all right so this result isn't right and I went back and align: start position: 0% result isn't right and I went back and align: start position: 0% result isn't right and I went back and found the issue the issue is that we are align: start position: 0% found the issue the issue is that we are align: start position: 0% found the issue the issue is that we are passing the current candles but as it align: start position: 0% passing the current candles but as it align: start position: 0% passing the current candles but as it was the case in here we later converted align: start position: 0% was the case in here we later converted align: start position: 0% was the case in here we later converted the current candles into price returns align: start position: 0% the current candles into price returns align: start position: 0% the current candles into price returns so we need to do the same thing in here align: start position: 0% so we need to do the same thing in here align: start position: 0% so we need to do the same thing in here so I'm going to select this and instead align: start position: 0% so I'm going to select this and instead align: start position: 0% so I'm going to select this and instead return prizes to returns and then pass align: start position: 0% return prizes to returns and then pass align: start position: 0% return prizes to returns and then pass this and this all right and I'm also align: start position: 0% this and this all right and I'm also align: start position: 0% this and this all right and I'm also going to do it here all right so again align: start position: 0% going to do it here all right so again align: start position: 0% going to do it here all right so again we are converting the current candles align: start position: 0% we are converting the current candles align: start position: 0% we are converting the current candles into price returns and and that's the align: start position: 0% into price returns and and that's the align: start position: 0% into price returns and and that's the correct format for the calculations that align: start position: 0% correct format for the calculations that align: start position: 0% correct format for the calculations that we did with zcore and everything else align: start position: 0% we did with zcore and everything else align: start position: 0% we did with zcore and everything else all right so let's go back and run this align: start position: 0% all right so let's go back and run this align: start position: 0% all right so let's go back and run this one more align: start position: 0% one more align: start position: 0% one more time there we go this Equity curve looks align: start position: 0% time there we go this Equity curve looks align: start position: 0% time there we go this Equity curve looks unbelievably good and is for the last 12 align: start position: 0% unbelievably good and is for the last 12 align: start position: 0% unbelievably good and is for the last 12 months the profit was 69% the Maxon isus align: start position: 0% months the profit was 69% the Maxon isus align: start position: 0% months the profit was 69% the Maxon isus 5% the M rate is 53% the sharp is align: start position: 0% 5% the M rate is 53% the sharp is align: start position: 0% 5% the M rate is 53% the sharp is 2. 94 and the calmer is align: start position: 0% 2. 94 and the calmer is align: start position: 0% 2. 94 and the calmer is 13. 77 all right so let's go back and align: start position: 0% 13. 77 all right so let's go back and align: start position: 0% 13. 77 all right so let's go back and turn on The Benchmark feature too and align: start position: 0% turn on The Benchmark feature too and align: start position: 0% turn on The Benchmark feature too and run it one more time so while that's align: start position: 0% run it one more time so while that's align: start position: 0% run it one more time so while that's going I want to quickly remind you guys align: start position: 0% going I want to quickly remind you

videos all right so check this out while the align: start position: 0% all right so check this out while the align: start position: 0% all right so check this out while the price was going up we made money while align: start position: 0% price was going up we made money while align: start position: 0% price was going up we made money while the price was going down we made money align: start position: 0% the price was going down we made money align: start position: 0% the price was going down we made money when it was in a Range we also made align: start position: 0% when it was in a Range we also made align: start position: 0% when it was in a Range we also made money so that's why we call this align: start position: 0% money so that's why we call this align: start position: 0% money so that's why we call this strategy a market neutral strategy cuz align: start position: 0% strategy a market neutral strategy cuz align: start position: 0% strategy a market neutral strategy cuz no matter if it's going up or down or in align: start position: 0% no matter if it's going up or down or in align: start position: 0% no matter if it's going up or down or in range you're going to make money as long align: start position: 0% range you're going to make money as long align: start position: 0% range you're going to make money as long as the bet that these two prize assets align: start position: 0% as the bet that these two prize assets align: start position: 0% as the bet that these two prize assets are going to Great is true right so align: start position: 0% are going to Great is true right so align: start position: 0% are going to Great is true right so that's why it's really fantastic so guys align: start position: 0% that's why it's really fantastic so guys align: start position: 0% that's why it's really fantastic so guys this result is actually too good to be align: start position: 0% this result is actually too good to be align: start position: 0% this result is actually too good to be true so I'm just going to buy a Lambo align: start position: 0% true so I'm just going to buy a Lambo align: start position: 0% true so I'm just going to buy a Lambo and make videos about how rich I am all align: start position: 0% and make videos about how rich I am all align: start position: 0% and make videos about how rich I am all right see you in the next video but hold align: start position: 0% right see you in the next video but hold align: start position: 0% right see you in the next video but hold on a second there's a catch multiple align: start position: 0% on a second there's a catch multiple align: start position: 0% on a second there's a catch multiple love them you see unlike my other videos align: start position: 0% love them you see unlike my other videos align: start position: 0% love them you see unlike my other videos or back test that I run I actually align: start position: 0% or back test that I run I actually align: start position: 0% or back test that I run I actually disable the trading fees in this case align: start position: 0% disable the trading fees in this case align: start position: 0% disable the trading fees in this case that's why we are not paying any trading align: start position: 0% that's why we are not paying any trading align: start position: 0% that's why we are not paying any trading fees and this is really important align: start position: 0% fees and this is really important align: start position: 0% fees and this is really important because it is taking align: start position: 0% because it is taking align: start position: 0% because it is taking 7, 818 trades over a year that's simply align: start position: 0% 7, 818 trades over a year that's simply align: start position: 0% 7, 818 trades over a year that's simply too many trades and it's not like we own align: start position: 0% too many trades and it's not like we own align: start position: 0% too many trades and it's not like we own the exchange or are friends with them we align: start position: 0% the exchange or are friends with them we align: start position: 0% the exchange or are friends with them we are going to have to pay for trading align: start position: 0% are going to have to pay for trading align: start position: 0% are going to have to pay for trading fees and we're not even in hedge fund align: start position: 0% fees and we're not even in hedge fund align: start position: 0% fees and we're not even in hedge fund because hedge funds and I'm guessing align: start position: 0% because hedge funds and I'm guessing align: start position: 0% because hedge funds and I'm guessing Edward torb two they paid very little align: start position: 0% Edward torb two they paid very little align: start position: 0% Edward torb two they paid very little fees because they had special contracts align: start position: 0% fees because they had special contracts align: start position: 0% fees because they had special contracts but we don't so if we set the trading align: start position: 0% but we don't so if we set the trading align: start position: 0% but we don't so if we set the trading fee to what it actually would be on align: start position: 0% fee to what it actually would be on align: start position: 0% fee to what it actually would be on bance features and run this one more align: start position: 0% bance features and run this one more align: start position: 0% bance features and run this one more time let's disable the Benchmark align: start position: 0% time let's disable the Benchmark align: start position: 0% time let's disable the Benchmark feature now the result actually looks align: start position: 0% feature now the result actually looks align: start position: 0% feature now the result actually looks awful so we started by 10, 000 and we align: start position: 0% awful so we started by 10, 000 and we align: start position: 0% awful so we started by 10, 000 and we ended with align: start position: 0% ended with align: start position: 0% ended with $343 now why is this is because again align: start position: 0% $343 now why is this is because again align: start position: 0% $343 now why is this is because again we're taking too many trades and we are align: start position: 0% we're taking too many trades and we are align: start position: 0% we're taking too many trades and we are paying just too much in trading fees align: start position: 0% paying just too much in trading fees align: start position: 0% paying just too much in trading fees we're paying 11 $1, 000 in trading fees align: start position: 0% we're paying 11 $1, 000 in trading fees align: start position: 0% we're paying 11 $1, 000 in trading fees now it actually gets worse in reality align: start position: 0% now it actually gets worse in reality align: start position: 0% now it actually gets worse in reality not only we would have to pay this much align: start position: 0% not only we would have to pay this much align: start position: 0% not only we would have to pay this much trading fees but we're also going to align: start position: 0% trading fees but we're also going to align: start position: 0% trading fees but we're also going to have slippage and because in this align: start position: 0% have slippage and because in this align: start position: 0% have slippage and because in this strategy at least at the current state align: start position: 0% strategy at least at the current state align: start position: 0% strategy at least at the current state of it we're even counting on trades with align: start position: 0% of it we're even counting on trades with align: start position: 0% of it we're even counting on trades with very small margin of profit so that align: start position: 0% very small margin of profit so that align: start position: 0% very small margin of profit so that means if there's going to be slippage align: start position: 0% means if there's going to be slippage align: start position: 0% means if there's going to be slippage which there will be the results will align: start position: 0% which there will be the results will align: start position: 0% which there will be the results will look even worse than this so to get the align: start position: 0% look even worse than this so to get the align: start position: 0% look even worse than this so to get the real estate results we need to set this align: start position: 0% real estate results we need to set this align: start position: 0% real estate results we need to set this to a higher number such as this or maybe align: start position: 0% to a higher number such as this or maybe align: start position: 0% to a higher number such as this or maybe this one so what does this mean it means align: start position: 0% this one so what does this mean it means align: start position: 0% this one so what does this mean it means that if you're a H fund you can probably align: start position: 0% that if you're a H fund you can probably align: start position: 0% that if you're a H fund you can probably already trade this if you can get some align: start position: 0% already trade this if you can get some align: start position: 0% already trade this if you can get some kind of special contract or trade it on align: start position: 0% kind of special contract or trade it on align: start position: 0% kind of special contract or trade it on an exchange that has very little fees align: start position: 0% an exchange that has very little fees align: start position: 0% an exchange that has very little fees but for most of us that's not the case align: start position: 0% but for most of us that's not the case align: start position: 0% but for most of us that's not the case so what we can do is to implement as align: start position: 0% so what we can do is to implement as align: start position: 0% so what we can do is to implement as many filters as possible to make sure align: start position: 0% many filters as possible to make sure align: start position: 0% many filters as possible to make sure that we only take the trades that are align: start position: 0% that we only take the trades that are align: start position: 0% that we only take the trades that are worth it now the other thing that we can align: start position: 0% worth it now the other thing that we can align: start position: 0% worth it now the other thing that we can do is to trade only assets that are more align: start position: 0% do is to trade only assets that are more align: start position: 0% do is to trade only assets that are more volatile for example mem coins we know align: start position: 0% volatile for example mem coins we know align: start position: 0% volatile for example mem coins we know they are correlated with each other but align: start position: 0% they are correlated with each other but align: start position: 0% they are correlated with each other but they move much more and that means our align: start position: 0% they move much more and that means our align: start position: 0% they move much more and that means our trades probably won't have as little align: start position: 0% trades probably won't have as little align: start position: 0% trades probably won't have as little profit margin which would make it worth align: start position: 0% profit margin which would make it worth align: start position: 0% profit margin which would make it worth it for us I'm going to share the source align: start position: 0% it for us I'm going to share the source align: start position: 0% it for us I'm going to share the source code of this strategy on a GitHub align: start position: 0% code of this strategy on a GitHub align: start position: 0% code of this strategy on a GitHub repository and link to it down in the align: start position: 0% repository and link to it down in the align: start position: 0% repository and link to it down in the description it's going to be your align: start position: 0% description it's going to be your align: start position: 0% description it's going to be your homework to keep doing research and align: start position: 0% homework to keep doing research and align: start position: 0% homework to keep doing research and implementing filters to improve the align: start position: 0% implementing filters to improve the align: start position: 0% implementing filters to improve the results of this strategy and make it align: start position: 0% results of this strategy and make it align: start position: 0% results of this strategy and make it actually production ready you can also align: start position: 0% actually production ready you can also align: start position: 0% actually production ready you can also try it on other markets with different align: start position: 0% try it on other markets with different align: start position: 0% try it on other markets with different trading assets and see if it works there align: start position: 0% trading assets and see if it works there align: start position: 0% trading assets and see if it works there or preferably with exchanges that have align: start position: 0% or preferably with exchanges that have align: start position: 0% or preferably with exchanges that have lower trading fees I would love to see align: start position: 0% lower trading fees I would love to see align: start position: 0% lower trading fees I would love to see you guys on our Discord and share with align: start position: 0% you guys on our Discord and share with align: start position: 0% you guys on our Discord and share with me your experience with this strategy align: start position: 0% me your experience with this strategy align: start position: 0% me your experience with this strategy and let me know what works for you and align: start position: 0% and let me know what works for you and align: start position:
