    *   Settings for D-trended Price Oscillator: Length 23, Price Oscillator line increased in weight and turned blue.
    *   **Short Trade Entry:** Sell tag from Dynamic Score SMA + D-trended Price Oscillator below zero line. Stop loss is at SMA line and target 1:1.5 risk reward ratio
    *   **Long Trade Entry:** Buy tag from Dynamic Score SMA + D-trended Price Oscillator above zero line. Stop loss is at SMA line and target 1:1.5 risk reward ratio.
*  **Results of the Strategy Tested:**
    *    50 trades resulted in 19 wins and 31 losses.
    *   38% win rate using a 1:1.5 risk reward ratio.

**2. Core Point (One Sentence):** The tested crypto scalping strategy, using Dynamic Score SMA and D-trended Price Oscillator, proved unprofitable, highlighting the superior performance of the Academy of Forks indicator and its associated position management strategies.

**3. Fundamental Point (One Sentence):** Consistent profitability in trading relies on robust strategies and effective risk management, as demonstrated by the comparison between a newly tested strategy and a proven one.

**4. Overarching Framework:**

The content follows a framework of **testing and comparison** within the context of cryptocurrency trading. The speaker presents a data-driven approach where he tests different strategies and indicators. It transitions from showing the testing system with the scoreboard, then tests a new strategy and compares it against his existing best performing strategy, ultimately promoting a more profitable option and the associated community and educational resources.

in the align: start position: 0% accurate uh guess we'll see in the testing how accurate they can be but align: start position: 0% testing how accurate they can be but align: start position: 0% testing how accurate they can be but what we'll do is just go ahead and hide align: start position: 0% what we'll do is just go ahead and hide align: start position: 0% what we'll do is just go ahead and hide the two indicators we have on screen now align: start position: 0% the two indicators we have on screen now align: start position: 0% the two indicators we have on screen now the first indicator we will add to the align: start position: 0% the first indicator we will add to the align: start position: 0% the first indicator we will add to the screen is going to be the dynamic score align: start position: 0% screen is going to be the dynamic score align: start position: 0% screen is going to be the dynamic score SMA this one right here go ahead and align: start position: 0% SMA this one right here go ahead and align: start position: 0% SMA this one right here go ahead and click on that and add it to the screen align: start position: 0% click on that and add it to the screen align: start position: 0% click on that and add it to the screen and then we'll go ahead and jump into align: start position: 0% and then we'll go ahead and jump into align: start position: 0% and then we'll go ahead and jump into the settings and what you'll do is align: start position: 0% the settings and what you'll do is align: start position: 0% the settings and what you'll do is you'll change the SMA length to 25 align: start position: 0% you'll change the SMA length to 25 align: start position: 0% you'll change the SMA length to 25 you'll change the window link to 39 and align: start position: 0% you'll change the window link to 39 and align: start position: 0% you'll change the window link to 39 and the uptrend threshold to 37 and align: start position: 0% the uptrend threshold to 37 and align: start position: 0% the uptrend threshold to 37 and everything else stays on the default go align: start position: 0% everything else stays on the default go align: start position: 0% everything else stays on the default go ahead and click okay the next indicator align: start position: 0% ahead and click okay the next indicator align: start position: 0% ahead and click okay the next indicator we will add to the screen it's going to align: start position: 0% we will add to the screen it's going to align: start position: 0% we will add to the screen it's going to be the D trended price oscillator this align: start position: 0% be the D trended price oscillator this align: start position: 0% be the D trended price oscillator this one right here it's just a standard align: start position: 0% one right here it's just a standard align: start position: 0% one right here it's just a standard Trading align: start position: 0% Trading align: start position: 0% Trading builtin indicator and we'll go ahead and align: start position: 0% builtin indicator and we'll go ahead and align: start position: 0% builtin indicator and we'll go ahead and jump into the settings of this as well align: start position: 0% jump into the settings of this as well align: start position: 0% jump into the settings of this as well and what we'll do is under the length align: start position: 0% and what we'll do is under the length align: start position: 0% and what we'll do is under the length right here we'll go ahead and change align: start position: 0% right here we'll go ahead and change align: start position: 0% right here we'll go ahead and change that to align: start position: 0% that to align: start position: 0% that to 23 and under the Styles I just went align: start position: 0% 23 and under the Styles I just went align: start position: 0% 23 and under the Styles I just went ahead and bumped up the line weight of align: start position: 0% ahead and bumped up the line weight of align: start position: 0% ahead and bumped up the line weight of the uh price oscillator line and I align: start position: 0% the uh price oscillator line and I align: start position: 0% the uh price oscillator line and I turned it blue just that way it stands align: start position: 0% turned it blue just that way it stands align: start position: 0% turned it blue just that way it stands out just tad bit uh more on the align: start position: 0% out just tad bit uh more on the align: start position: 0% out just tad bit uh more on the background there and so what we're align: start position: 0% background there and so what we're align: start position: 0% background there and so what we're looking for for a short trade so we're align: start position: 0% looking for for a short trade so we're align: start position: 0% looking for for a short trade so we're looking for when we get a sell tag like align: start position: 0% looking for when we get a sell tag like align: start position: 0% looking for when we get a sell tag like this right here from the dynamic score align: start position: 0% this right here from the dynamic score align: start position: 0% this right here from the dynamic score SMA and when we get that cell tag we're align: start position: 0% SMA and when we get that cell tag we're align: start position: 0% SMA and when we get that cell tag we're then going to look down to the D trended align: start position: 0% then going to look down to the D trended align: start position: 0% then going to look down to the D trended price oscillator and we want the line align: start position: 0% price oscillator and we want the line align: start position: 0% price oscillator and we want the line the uh Price Line there to be below the align: start position: 0% the uh Price Line there to be below the align: start position: 0% the uh Price Line there to be below the zero Line This dashed line right here if align: start position: 0% zero Line This dashed line right here if align: start position: 0% zero Line This dashed line right here if I move my cursor out of the way you can align: start position: 0% I move my cursor out of the way you can align: start position: 0% I move my cursor out of the way you can see there's a dashed line right there we align: start position: 0% see there's a dashed line right there we align: start position: 0% see there's a dashed line right there we can actually bump up the line weight of align: start position: 0% can actually bump up the line weight of align: start position: 0% can actually bump up the line weight of that a tad bit more so that way it's align: start position: 0% that a tad bit more so that way it's align: start position: 0% that a tad bit more so that way it's really apparent where that's at so you align: start position: 0% really apparent where that's at so you align: start position: 0% really apparent where that's at so you can see the lines below that zero line align: start position: 0% can see the lines below that zero line align: start position: 0% can see the lines below that zero line that dash line right there and once that align: start position: 0% that dash line right there and once that align: start position: 0% that dash line right there and once that all lines up that will be the signal to align: start position: 0% all lines up that will be the signal to align: start position: 0% all lines up that will be the signal to then enter into a short we'll put our align: start position: 0% then enter into a short we'll put our align: start position: 0% then enter into a short we'll put our trade right here we'll put our stop at align: start position: 0% trade right here we'll put our stop at align: start position: 0% trade right here we'll put our stop at the uh SMA line right here and then align: start position: 0% the uh SMA line right here and then align: start position: 0% the uh SMA line right here and then we'll Target a 1 to 1. 5 risk reward so align: start position: 0% we'll Target a 1 to 1. 5 risk reward so align: start position: 0% we'll Target a 1 to 1. 5 risk reward so that'll put us right about there let's align: start position: 0% that'll put us right about there let's align: start position: 0% that'll put us right about there let's go ahead and play this forward and see align: start position: 0% go ahead and play this forward and see align: start position: 0% go ahead and play this forward and see how it plays out align: start position: 0% align: start position: 0% and you can see takes just a little bit align: start position: 0% and you can see takes just a little bit align: start position: 0% and you can see takes just a little bit but then we make this really nice push align: start position: 0% but then we make this really nice push align: start position: 0% but then we make this really nice push to the downside getting us to our align: start position: 0% to the downside getting us to our align: start position: 0% to the downside getting us to our takeprofit and for a long trade what we align: start position: 0% takeprofit and for a long trade what we align: start position: 0% takeprofit and for a long trade what we are looking for so we're looking for align: start position: 0% are looking for so we're looking for align: start position: 0% are looking for so we're looking for when we get a long tag or a buy Tag like align: start position: 0% when we get a long tag or a buy Tag like align: start position: 0% when we get a long tag or a buy Tag like this here uh from the uh SMA the dynamic align: start position: 0% this here uh from the uh SMA the dynamic align: start position: 0% this here uh from the uh SMA the dynamic score SMA then we're looking for the uh align: start position: 0% score SMA then we're looking for the uh align: start position: 0% score SMA then we're looking for the uh de trended price oscillator to be above align: start position: 0% de trended price oscillator to be above align: start position: 0% de trended price oscillator to be above that zero line you can see that those align: start position: 0% that zero line you can see that those align: start position: 0% that zero line you can see that those line up right here and so again that align: start position: 0% line up right here and so again that align: start position: 0% line up right here and so again that will be the signal to then enter into a align: start position: 0% will be the signal to then enter into a align: start position: 0% will be the signal to then enter into a long we'll put our trade right here align: start position: 0% long we'll put our trade right here align: start position: 0% long we'll put our trade right here we'll put our stop right here again at align: start position: 0% we'll put our stop right here again at align: start position: 0% we'll put our stop right here again at the SMA line and then we're going to align: start position: 0% the SMA line and then we're going to align: start position: 0% the SMA line and then we're going to Target the same one to 1. 5 risk reward align: start position: 0% Target the same one to 1. 5 risk reward align: start position: 0% Target the same one to 1. 5 risk reward that's actually a tad bit more than the align: start position: 0% that's actually a tad bit more than the align: start position: 0% that's actually a tad bit more than the 1 to 1. 5 but we'll go ahead and play align: start position: 0% 1 to 1. 5 but we'll go ahead and play align: start position: 0% 1 to 1. 5 but we'll go ahead and play this forward see how it works align: start position: 0% this forward see how it works align: start position: 0% this forward see how it works out and within two candles we make this align: start position: 0% out and within two candles we make this align: start position: 0% out and within two candles we make this really nice push to the upside getting align: start position: 0% really nice push to the upside getting align: start position: 0% really nice push to the upside getting us to our take profit all right so that align: start position: 0% us to our take profit all right so that align: start position: 0% us to our take profit all right so that puts us at the end of the testing right align: start position: 0% puts us at the end of the testing right align: start position: 0% puts us at the end of the testing right there before we take a look at what this align: start position: 0% there before we take a look at what this align: start position: 0% there before we take a look at what this was able to achieve if you are align: start position: 0% was able to achieve if you are align: start position: 0% was able to achieve if you are interested in a profitable

position: 0% let's go ahead and go over the numbers on the strategy so we did the 50 trade align: start position: 0% on the strategy so we did the 50 trade align: start position: 0% on the strategy so we did the 50 trade test like we normally do and out of align: start position: 0% test like we normally do and out of align: start position: 0% test like we normally do and out of those 50 trades we got 19 winning trades align: start position: 0% those 50 trades we got 19 winning trades align: start position: 0% those 50 trades we got 19 winning trades and 31 losing trades it's going to put align: start position: 0% and 31 losing trades it's going to put align: start position: 0% and 31 losing trades it's going to put it at a 38% win rate with the 1 to 1. 5 align: start position: 0% it at a 38% win rate with the 1 to 1. 5 align: start position: 0% it at a 38% win rate with the 1 to 1. 5 risk reward if you're looking to gain align: start position: 0% risk reward if you're looking to gain align: start position: 0% risk reward if you're looking to gain $600 per winning trade your total gain align: start position: 0% $600 per winning trade your total gain align: start position: 0% $600 per winning trade your total gain would be $11, 400 on the losing side you align: start position: 0% would be $11, 400 on the losing side you align: start position: 0% would be $11, 400 on the
