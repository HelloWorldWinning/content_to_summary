Description:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided content:

**Summary Outline:**

1.  **Introduction to Prop Firms:**
    *   Proprietary trading firms (prop firms) provide capital for traders to trade financial markets.
    *   Traders share a percentage of the profits with the prop firm.
    *   This allows traders to profit without using their own capital, while the firm takes on the risk.

2.  **Becoming a Funded Trader:**
    *   Requires passing an evaluation phase, involving trading on a demo account.
    *   Evaluations have specific conditions, including trading goals, profit targets, and risk limits.
    *   Prop firms have strict risk management rules: drawdown limits, daily loss limits, and position sizing rules.
    *   Passing the evaluation leads to a funded account with real money.
    *   Traders receive a profit share, sometimes as high as 95%.

3.  **Strategy for Prop Firm Challenges (Fast & High Risk-Reward):**
    *   Need a fast strategy with a high risk-to-reward ratio to pass evaluation due to time constraints.
    *   The video demonstrates using the ICT model during the Asia session on a 5-minute timeframe.

4.  **FundedNext Prop Firm:**
    *   Mentioned as a suitable prop firm, offering over 30 trading plans.
    *   Plans vary in challenge types (two-step, single step), profit targets, and commissions.
    *   FundedNext refunds the plan cost upon passing the challenge and gives an additional reward.
    *   Positive user feedback and high ratings on Trustpilot for support and ease of use.
    *   Offers competitive profit sharing, up to 95% payout.
    *   Multiple payment options are available (bank transfers, PayPal, cryptocurrencies).

5.  **Asia Kill Zone Trading Strategy (ICT Model):**
    *   **Time Range:** 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM (UTC New York Time).
    *   **Conditions for a Valid Zone:**
        *   Near an important trading area on the 1-hour time frame (e.g., fair value gap or order block).
        *   Market in an accumulation phase (forming equal highs and lows).
    *   **Manipulation Phase (5-minute timeframe):**
        *   Market distorts price movements (false breakouts).
        *   Price moves beyond the Kill Zone and hits an important level on the 1-hour timeframe.
        *   A market structure shift should form after price hits an important level.
    *   **Entry:**
        *   Price returns to the order block or fair value gap on the 5-minute chart after the market structure shift.
        *   Stop-loss is set above the entry point, and take-profit just below the Kill Zone.

6.  **Examples:**
    *   **USDJPY Example:** Valid Kill Zone, market structure shift occurs as expected.
    *   **GBPJPY Examples:**
        *   **First Kill Zone (Invalid):** Market in a bearish trend, not accumulation.
        *   **Second Kill Zone (Invalid):** No market structure shift after reaching an important 1H level
        *  **Third Kill Zone (Valid):** Market is in accumulation, then has market structure shift after reaching an important 1H level.

**Core Point:**

To become a funded trader, one needs to pass a prop firm's evaluation, typically using a fast, high risk-reward trading strategy, and understanding the specific conditions required for entering a valid trade within strategies like using Asia Kill Zone .

**Fundamental Point:**

Success in prop firm trading hinges on strict risk management and understanding the interplay of market phases, levels, and structures for precise trade execution.

**Overarching Framework:**

The content uses a problem-solution approach, starting with the goal of becoming a funded trader, introducing prop firms as a pathway, highlighting the evaluation process, and focusing on specific trading strategies and techniques using a specific prop firm (FundedNext) as an example, all within the context of utilizing the Asia Kill Zone in the ICT model to improve efficiency and clarity.

evident on the 5minute align: start position: 0% zone is clearly evident on the 5minute time frame the market is not in an align: start position: 0% time frame the market is not in an align: start position: 0% time frame the market is not in an accumulation phase we mentioned that one align: start position: 0% accumulation phase we mentioned that one align: start position: 0% accumulation phase we mentioned that one of the key characteristics of the align: start position: 0% of the key characteristics of the align: start position: 0% of the key characteristics of the accumulation phase is the presence of align: start position: 0% accumulation phase is the presence of align: start position: 0% accumulation phase is the presence of equal highs and lows however here we can align: start position: 0% equal highs and lows however here we can align: start position: 0% equal highs and lows however here we can see that the market is in a beish trend align: start position: 0% see that the market is in a beish trend align: start position: 0% see that the market is in a beish trend and instead of forming equal highs and align: start position: 0% and instead of forming equal highs and align: start position: 0% and instead of forming equal highs and lows it has formed a new lower align: start position: 0% lows it has formed a new lower align: start position: 0% lows it has formed a new lower low but do you think the second scenario align: start position: 0% low but do you think the second scenario align: start position: 0% low but do you think the second scenario is suitable for entering a trade the align: start position: 0% is suitable for entering a trade the align: start position: 0% is suitable for entering a trade the market is in an accumulation phase align: start position: 0% market is in an accumulation phase align: start position: 0% market is in an accumulation phase during the Asian Kill Zone then it align: start position: 0% during the Asian Kill Zone then it align: start position: 0% during the Asian Kill Zone then it reaches an important 1hour level and the align: start position: 0% reaches an important 1hour level and the align: start position: 0% reaches an important 1hour level and the price returns to the order block on the align: start position: 0% price returns to the order block on the align: start position: 0% price returns to the order block on the 5-minute chart we must say that despite align: start position: 0% 5-minute chart we must say that despite align: start position: 0% 5-minute chart we must say that despite all of this it still isn't a suitable align: start position: 0% all of this it still isn't a suitable align: start position: 0% all of this it still isn't a suitable entry for a trade because after reaching align: start position: 0% entry for a trade because after reaching align: start position: 0% entry for a trade because after reaching the important 1H hour level the market align: start position: 0% the important 1H hour level the market align: start position: 0% the important 1H hour level the market structure hasn't shifted remember an align: start position: 0% structure hasn't shifted remember an align: start position: 0% structure hasn't shifted remember an order block is valid for us only if it align: start position: 0% order block is valid for us only if it align: start position: 0% order block is valid for us only if it leads to a market structure shift align: start position: 0% align: start position: 0% and finally the most important example align: start position: 0% and finally the most important example align: start position: 0% and finally the most important example of this strategy it is clearly visible align: start position: 0% of this strategy it is clearly visible align: start position: 0% of this strategy it is clearly visible on the 1-hour chart that the Kill Zone align: start position: 0% on the 1-hour chart that the Kill Zone align: start position: 0% on the 1-hour chart that the Kill Zone was formed before the price reached the align: start position: 0% was formed before the price reached the align: start position: 0% was formed before the price reached the order block and it can be considered align: start position: 0% order block and it can be considered align: start position: 0% order block and it can be considered suitable for entering the align: start position: 0% suitable for entering the align: start position: 0% suitable for entering the trade however in the 5-minute time frame align: start position: 0% trade however in the 5-minute time frame align: start position: 0% trade however in the 5-minute time frame the market crossed the accumulation Zone align: start position: 0% the market crossed the accumulation Zone align: start position: 0% the market crossed the accumulation Zone twice before returning to it this means align: start position: 0% twice before returning to it this means align: start position: 0% twice before returning to it this means that if we had considered the first move align: start position: 0% that if we had considered the first move align: start position: 0% that if we had considered the first move as manipulation and a market structure align: start position: 0% as manipulation and a market structure align: start position: 0% as manipulation and a market structure shift and entered the trade it would align: start position: 0% shift and entered the trade it would align: start position: 0% shift and entered the trade it would have triggered our stop loss so what is align: start position: 0% have triggered our stop loss so what is align: start position: 0% have triggered our stop loss so what is the reason we should wait as we align: start position: 0% the reason we should wait as we align: start position: 0% the reason we should wait as we mentioned earlier the price reaching a align: start position: 0% mentioned earlier the price reaching a align: start position: 0% mentioned earlier the price reaching a key level on the 1-hour chart should align: start position: 0% key level on the 1-hour chart should align: start position: 0% key level on the 1-hour chart should lead to a market structure shift in the align: start position: 0% lead to a market structure shift in the align: start position: 0% lead to a market structure shift in the first case the price reversed without align: start position: 0% first case the price reversed without align: start position: 0% first case the price reversed without reaching the key level and then after align: start position: 0% reaching the key level and then after align: start position: 0% reaching the key level and then after breaking the previous resistance and align: start position: 0% breaking the previous resistance and align: start position: 0% breaking the previous resistance and reaching the 1-hour order block the align: start position: 0% reaching the 1-hour order block the align: start position: 0% reaching the 1-hour order block the overall market movement changed align: start position: 0% overall market movement changed align: start position: 0% overall market movement changed therefore the order block form from the align: start position: 0% therefore the order block form from the align: start position: 0% therefore the order block form from the second movie is
