Description:
Okay, here's a structured summary of the provided content, along with the requested elements:

**1. Outline and Structured Summary:**

*   **I. Introduction:**
    *   Review of the previous episode's core issue: Chinese education treats students as passive recipients of knowledge.
    *   Learning is seen as training and memorization, not dialogue.
    *   Failure is attributed to the student, not teaching methods.
*   **II. Contrast with Western Educational Philosophy:**
    *   Locke's view: Education should be tailored to children's understanding, not abstract reasoning.
    *   Educators bear the responsibility to improve methods if students struggle.
*   **III. The Problematic Dynamics of Chinese Education:**
    *   **Pressure and Competition:**
        *   Emphasis on exams and rankings create peer pressure and psychological trauma.
        *   Peer relationships become competitive instead of supportive.
    *   **Toxic Memory:**
        *   Anxiety-driven rote memorization due to deadlines and high-stakes testing.
        *   Results in fragmented, incoherent knowledge, impacting later cognitive abilities (e.g., navigation, memory).
    *   **Writing Trauma:**
        *   Formulaic writing assignments discourage true self-expression.
        *   Students lose the ability to connect with their feelings through words, leading to aversion to writing.
    *   **English Language Trauma:**
        *   Overemphasis on grammar and pronunciation correctness leads to shame and fear.
        *   Focus on input (memorization) over output (speaking, writing).
    *   **Mathematical Trauma:**
        *   High stakes associated with math performance, leading to fear and self-doubt.
        *   Misconception that mathematical ability is the primary indicator of overall intelligence and logical thinking.
*   **IV. The Misunderstanding of Logic and Critical Thinking:**
    *   Distinction between mathematical logic and critical thinking:
        *   Mathematical logic is precise and abstract; critical thinking applies to complex real-life situations.
        *   Chinese education often conflates mathematical ability with general logic and reasoning.
    *   Critical thinking involves analyzing information, evaluating arguments, and reflecting on one's own views, not just formal math skills.
    *   Aristotle's *Rhetoric* provides a basis for critical thinking, including identifying logical fallacies.
*   **V. The Broader Impact of Traumas:**
    *   Traumas are often attributed to individuals, leading to learned helplessness.
    *   Dyslexia and other learning difficulties are often overlooked and dismissed as "stupidity".
    *   Importance of parents' reading habits and communication styles for children's language development is emphasized.
    *   Monotonous, closed school environment leads to low language stimulation, inhibiting language ability.
*   **VI. The Essentialist Attribution Model and its Harmful Effects:**
     *  The education system tends to attribute success and failure to innate talent or personal perseverance, which is harmful to both 'winners' and 'losers'
     *  'Winners' develop lower self-complexity, a sense of superiority, and disdain collaboration.
     *  'Losers' internalize negative evaluations and cannot reflect on environmental factors
*   **VII. Conclusion:**
    *   No real "winners" in China's exam-oriented education; all are harmed by this model.
    *   Open invitation for viewers to communicate via email for further discussion on various topics.

**2. Core Point (One Sentence):**
The Chinese education system, with its emphasis on rote memorization, high-stakes testing, and the attribution of failure to the individual, creates widespread trauma that hinders genuine learning and the development of critical thinking skills.

**3. Fundamental Point (One Sentence):**
The core issue lies in the lack of understanding and empathy for students' individual cognitive processes, leading to a learning environment that inhibits potential rather than nurturing it.

**4. Overarching Framework:**
The overarching framework is a critique of the Chinese education system using a lens of developmental psychology and educational theory, focusing on the negative impact of its methods on students' mental well-being, cognitive development, and overall sense of self-worth, contrasting it with more student-centric approach in western philosophy.

Content:
WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en Hello everyone, I am Anthony Welcome to my channel In the previous episode We talked about A core issue of China's educational philosophy That is It presupposes that students are passive recipients of information The object of knowledge imparted by teachers Teachers are the main body of learning Students should cooperate with teachers to complete learning tasks Therefore, the essence of learning is a training Rather than dialogue Students should memorize in one direction. Understand and comprehend the meaning of authority When students have difficulty understanding China's education system It will first be attributed to the students' responsibility For example, the students are too stupid. Lack of understanding, no talent, etc. Without reflection Are educators close to students' cognitive laws? Be patient with students Is it possible? Explained in an easy-to-understand way This inward-looking approach It is easy to cause learned helplessness and various psychological traumas At the end of the previous video We quoted Locke's "Education" To explain the deep differences between Chinese and Western educational concepts Locke believed Educating and reasoning with children Should be appropriate for young children’s abilities and understanding We should not lecture young children at length. Philosophical reasoning Nor should we adopt unfamiliar principles This can only dazzle children Education for children must be easy to understand To build on what they can feel and on things that are touched This obviously includes the following meaning: Children cannot understand the teaching content First and foremost, it is the responsibility of educators Educators should take the initiative to improve their methods To stimulate children's potential The Chinese education system seems to believe that Students can't understand First of all, it is the students' own responsibility Even the more difficult the learning task is The more it can inspire students' fighting spirit The more intelligent students can be selected As for the others They are all eliminated losers therefore Many tools that could be used to improve learning In China, it is used to put pressure on students Creating pain A typical example is peer relationship In a good school environment Peers can support each other Encourage and appreciate Enables people to have a freer and richer mental state But Chinese education The ranking is through high-intensity examinations Causes comparison and psychological pressure among peers This further Suppressing students' advanced learning abilities In our video on December 1st Quote this article by Wozniak The concept of toxic memory is mentioned. Toxic memory Toxic memory It is a memory associated with anxiety and fear In education It often occurs when students are faced with deadlines. The next day of the exam As well as the time when the results and rankings are to be announced, etc. At this time, students will memorize by rote under anxiety No need for understanding Only to complete short-term tasks and goals The neural network in an anxious state is characterized by Low coherence, fragmentation Lack of deep integration of information and knowledge This often leads to the phenomenon Many Chinese Although his intelligence in other aspects is very high But it seems that many years It is difficult to complete and understand Some seemingly simple tasks For example, you can't understand the map navigation Stuttering I always can't remember some simple names of people and places. Road names, historical events, etc. Another example is dyslexia in a specific direction. For example, I feel particularly upset when reading literature. My mind goes blank when I see math problems These obstacles are very common in China Almost all of them can be traced back to adolescence Learning trauma at home and in school and profoundly affected them Learning and working abilities in adulthood For example Chinese students in primary and secondary schools Being repeatedly asked to write highly formulaic Chinese essays and accompanied by teacher criticism or public comparison This has led to many students becoming adults Still feel pain in writing Even writing a simple text at work Feeling strong resistance Even the brain is blank Don't know how to start Not even good at writing Words that express your true thoughts Once you write your true feelings I feel very ashamed Writing itself It can be used as a core means of self-exploration When a person's true thoughts When expressed through words He can experience the feeling of being heard. Even if it's just for myself This process of self-listening Very important for psychological integration But the composition of Chinese primary and secondary schools To a large extent Destroy students' normal feeling for words For example, students are asked to Conform to fixed moral standards For example, "Thanks to parents" and "Striving youth" These themes do not correspond to their true emotions We say The ability of an individual to understand his or her true feelings It requires long-term training and cultivation When writing is filled with lies and clichés for a long time individual I gradually lost the ability to accurately perceive words. I also lost the ability to write about my true feelings. certainly On the topic of Chinese language composition We will make a special video to discuss it later For example Many students learn English in primary and secondary school. Often due to grammatical errors or pronunciation problems Being laughed at by teachers or classmates Produce a strong sense of shame Even later Have the opportunity to engage in real English communication environment They still speak English Feeling extremely nervous or withdrawn This is often seen as a lack of linguistic talent. But in fact, it all stems from a bad learning environment China's English education focuses on input For example, memorizing words and reading But ignore the output That is, speaking and writing Students are forced to memorize large amounts of information But they are unable to translate this into actual communication skills. In addition, school education is not good at grammatical errors, Excessive focus on spelling errors Make students extremely afraid of making mistakes Suppressed their language expression Make students feel Learning English is a game where you can't make mistakes Who makes fewer mistakes Whoever scores higher This leads to many people speaking to foreigners Focusing too much on whether what you say is grammatical Is the word spelled correctly? Instead, it makes communication full of fear and pain. so I have seen people oppose the removal of English from the college entrance examination. This will make most Chinese students Lost the ability to communicate with the world but Does this kind of English education promote communication skills? Or did it foster a dislike for English? It’s actually hard to tell. We listed Chinese students above Learning Trauma in Writing and English But more common and profound is mathematical trauma In China's primary and secondary school examination system Mathematics occupies a very high weight And because the difficulty of math problems is high Compared with English, Chinese and other subjects Can widen the score gap Therefore, it has a decisive impact on the overall ranking of students. Especially important is In China’s education system Higher scores compared to other subjects Good math grades More likely to be seen as intelligent Smart, rational and logical thinking ability This is clearly a highly transferable skill. Poor math performance The blow to individual self-esteem must be more thorough This makes many people afraid of mathematics. Actively chose liberal arts Although Chinese education is generally bad But liberal arts education is actually much worse than science education The more serious trauma caused by mathematics Many Chinese people are very confident about their logical reasoning ability A deep self-doubt Even underestimated their own thinking ability But this is actually a huge misunderstanding Many people don’t realize Good math grades The thinking is rigorous compared to what we say in daily life The logic is not that important. Some people are good at math and physics. But when it comes to practical issues No logic or common sense. Because the logic contained in mathematics Especially mathematical logic It is a reasoning method based on mathematical symbols. It is also a highly formalized and precise tool. Its application range is relatively narrow. For example, proving mathematical theorems or designing algorithms And the person we usually say is very logical Clear thinking It means that this person has critical thinking. Critical Thinking Not limited to a strict formal notation Focus on individuals How to deal with complex situations in daily life Make reasonable judgments For example, analyzing social phenomena, resolving conflicts, and evaluating policies Evaluate the validity of others’ arguments Critical thinking also emphasizes Reflect on your own views and assumptions Identify those logical fallacies etc. But in the eyes of many Chinese This seems to be the category of liberal arts Many people understand logic as Who uses more mathematical or physical symbols? Whoever makes sense Mathematics is seen as a representation of hard logic This kind of logic of language rhetoric belongs to soft logic But in fact, this division between soft and hard is unreasonable. The relationship between hard logic and daily life Not as big as many people think. To sum up, Mathematical logic focuses on It is a precise answer to an abstract problem Critical thinking Committed to analyzing open problems in complex reality if Find a philosophical basis for critical thinking Then it is closer to Aristotle's rhetoric I will pick a passage from Rhetoric for you. On page 158 Aristotle analyzed many cases of erroneous reasoning. For example, event a happens after event b. People will think that event B is the cause of event A. But there may be no causal relationship between the two For example Someone said someone was a thief. Because he's a bad guy Aristotle pointed out that this argument is illogical. Because every thief is a bad guy But not every bad guy is a thief For example Aristotle warned people Don't be fooled by emotional arguments Don't appeal to authority These logical fallacies It is the textbook for every critical thinking course. Will discuss Therefore, critical thinking is more extensive It is not something that can be covered by mathematical logic. A person may be average in mathematics But in analyzing social phenomena When evaluating policies or solving everyday problems It is entirely possible to demonstrate strong critical thinking China's poor mathematics education Many people are afraid of numbers all their lives. Charts and data analysis This is of course very unfortunate But what is even more regrettable is that Many people are not very confident about their logical reasoning ability. and critical thinking It also caused low self-esteem In developed countries where critical thinking is taught The trauma a person suffers from in mathematics It does not spread to doubt the entire thinking ability Because students can learn social sciences, philosophy Even art to gain logical thinking ability In China Due to lack of critical thinking training Plus the illogical humanities and social science education Leading to the only logical training Focused almost entirely on mathematics and physics Science monopolizes the Chinese All impressions of reason and logic Humanities Almost synonymous with irrational and illogical This makes many people feel inferior in mathematics. It will spread to inferiority complex about overall thinking ability This can be said to be a trauma with Chinese characteristics. We listed above Trauma of the Chinese in several major disciplines In fact, there are many more Most importantly These traumas Often attributed to the parties themselves This will further deepen learned helplessness So someone asked before Why are there so many dyslexics in Western countries? Memory impairment, dyscalculia Impairment of meaning, writing difficulties Speech barriers, etc. Students with various problems In China There are far fewer students like this. The answer is simple Because these students will be labeled uniformly in China Labels of "stupid" and "low IQ" There is no detailed distinction at all “Stupid” is an essentialist attribution model He thought it was inexplicable and incomprehensible. It is a person's nature So we can only wait for some random, mysterious Unpredictable Turns That is what the Chinese often say. “This person suddenly got it. ” But it can actually be changed for example Study on executive function in children with developmental dyslexia This paper mentioned Dyslexia It has a lot to do with parents’ reading habits Highly educated parents Emphasis on children's early intellectual development More willing to tell stories to children and buy books Parent-child reading This will provide a rich language stimulation environment for children Enhance children's language production and expression skills Get developed Of course, the premise here is that parents Really like reading and thinking The higher the parents' cultural level, Vocabulary and language logic for daily communication The richer This will make it more likely to provide a free, Relaxed and diverse communication space I believe everyone still remembers The point we made in last week’s video That is, people only experience a feeling that arouses a lot of feelings. And the stage of absorbing a lot of knowledge Only then can we talk about identification Only then can we build a systematic and rigorous thinking ability The same is true for reading We say that the richer the language stimulation children perceive, the The better his reading ability is, The monotonous and closed environment of Chinese schools Equivalent to a low language stimulation environment It is precisely inhibiting students from reading and the ability to use language The process of Chinese students going to school It's a brutal knockout match. Every time we go to college, most people will be eliminated. But no matter how fierce the competition is There are always a few students who can win The school also tends to Making essentialist attributions For example, it comes down to their personal talent, perseverance Call them academic gods This makes those students who are labeled as poor students I can only be forced to accept the system's negative evaluation of myself Unable to reflect on environmental issues Because they can't explain Why can some people withstand the pressure of the environment? However Even the winning students They are also harmed by this kind of education. because In this essentialist mode of internal attribution They also have lower self-complexity They believe in individual genius or hard work. Ignoring the resources behind your success and environmental conditions Disregarding the power of institutional, environmental and social support They also despise solidarity and collaboration with others. Because of the winner's self-concept Based on "I am smarter than others" or on the basis of "I work harder" Once you fail They find it difficult to accept their own shortcomings Psychological breakdown and deep doubts about self-worth From the perspective of self-complexity There are no real winners in China's exam-oriented education That's it for today's video We will continue to discuss this topic later. Then let me say it last. If you have any confusion or questions Want to communicate with me Just contact my email directly for example You want to discuss an article with me A certain paragraph, a certain video A social phenomenon Or your diary Please send me the relevant text in advance. I will read it before the formal communication Or you want to discuss your life experience with me Confusion and emotion All are possible If you are concerned about privacy, security Any questions about payment and communication methods Please also tell me in time If you are unable to pay or join the membership Please contact me too I will provide other ways Please refer to this picture for details I will post this video Put it in the list of "Psychology and Education" Also recommend to everyone Check out my other videos in this list Thank you for watching, goodbye!
