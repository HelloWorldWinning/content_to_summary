WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en The average transaction value is less than 8 yuan but the annual revenue can far exceed 10 billion yuan Among the 650, 000 milk tea shops in the country its number is almost as much as the second to fifth place combined. By now, you should have guessed who it is that is Xiao Lin Milk Tea Shop No, no, no, we are not that great. It is Mixue Ice Cream and Tea (Mixue Bingcheng). Look, this is the ranking of global chain restaurant brands by the number of stores in 2023 Mixue has 36, 000 chain stores The top few are all established brands that have been around for over 50 years And the rise of Mixue really only happened in the past decade or so and it still maintains strong growth For example, its signature lemonade is being able to sell 1 billion cups annually Back in the day, Xiangpiaopiao's famous slogan said 700 million cups a year enough to circle the Earth twice In the first three quarters of 2023, the sale volume is 5. 8 billion cups. I don’t know how many times it can circle the earth Look there are countless popular tea brands now. Heytea, Nayuki, Ancient Tea, ChaPanda, Chagee There are many, but they are different Main point is that each has its own price range. As for Mixue, it has been focusing on the market below 10 yuan. It is no exaggeration to say that in this price range, it is a unique presence In fact, if you look at the high-priced market they may have many ways to play but when it comes to the affordable market they need support from commercial capabilities Let’s analyse the business secret The founder of Mixue is Zhang Hongchao He came from a poor family when he just graduated from middle school he already did a lot of jobs like repairing motorcycles, selling food, and farming Later, he went on to study at Henan University of Economics and Law When he was in school he started his first business in 1997 called Hanliu Shaved Ice, which sells shaved ice. This where the dream of Mixue began. However, he didn’t have it at the beginning. he was also in the midst of rapid urbanisation As soon as the store was set up it was about to be demolished In these five or six years, the store has been closed three times. and 4 demolitions Finally in 2003 right next to his alma mater he opened a small store called Mixue Bingcheng But Mixue at the time was not a milk tea shop. It sold everything, including shaved ice and homemade dishes Anyway, the focus was on offering great value for money a hamburger that costs 3 yuan a plate of fried rice for 2. 50 yuan it is very popular among students. The business gradually became prosperous In 2006 when the popularity of the Olympics was very high, there was an ice cream cone in Henan that looked like a torch and sold for nearly 20 yuan but it was still very popular. Compared with 3 yuan burger and 2. 50 yuan fried rice ice cream is not a complicated thing, why should it cost 20 yuan So Zhang Hongchao started researching how to make this torch ice cream, he bought a second-hand ice cream machine and went to the cone supplier to study the formula and managed to came out with a result Although the taste of this ice cream is not as good as the torch ice cream but price is definitely the lowest It only costs 1 yuan 1 yuan Someone selling it for 20 yuan while he sells it at only 1 yuan It instantly became popular and it is still one of his flagship products. The popularity of the ice cream also led Zhang Hongchao to open branches Relatives and friends joined in one after another which also formed the earliest franchise model of Mixue These relatives and friends were also the first batch of Mixue's franchisees In the next few years, Mixue kept branches out and developed until 2013, when the gears of fate started turning again. At that time, Mixue wanted to find a drink suitable for summer. In the end, they set their sights on lemons but lemonade is not as easy as just putting lemons into water and then it’s done. I don’t know if you have done it, but it’s either too sour or tasteless it's just not that good. It's no exaggeration to say that when optimizing this lemonade, Mixue's team tasted all kinds of lemons from around the world. Picking lemon like tasting wine so they chose the kind of lemon which the scent, sweetness and sourness is balanced. Eureka Lemon Moreover, they carefully select the weight sugar content, and juice yield of the Eureka lemon It must meet the standards Only then they'll use it The key is that drawing on the successful experience of the ice cream they also lowered the price It’s only 3 yuan. 3 yuan is basically equivalent to buying bottled iced tea at a convenience store. The key is the price you get a freshly made drink and it's made with fresh lemons So when it was launched it became Mixue’s flagship product and now it sells 1 billion cups annually Even now, after a decade In most of the region its price has only increased to 4 yuan. As for why it manages to keep the price down, we will analyse it in a bit. In the next few years fresh fruit tea and fresh milk tea like Heytea, Nayuki were popping out Unknowingly, when you go shopping bottled drinks are replaced with milk tea, fruit tea Mixue also reaped the benefits from this trend. The difference is that they actually have been deeply involved in the market under 10 yuan. With its price advantage, it has steadily become the unique presence in the market. You see, other milk tea shops almost always have to rely on new products to attract customers. It is inevitable that everyone will compete with each other and imitate each other. But the path that Mixue takes is simple and clear. As we all know, his trump card is price, but despite it being an open secret no one can imitate it. How can it achieve such an extreme price? The key is just three words supply chain management We need to bit by bit go deeper into the core of Mixue’s business In the one or two decades leading up to the 2010s franchise model like Mixue the core issue behind the closure of many chain restaurants is the supply chain For example, look at Haidilao to be so successful, you would think that its core is service. Of course, service is also a very important part. It is actually king in the construction of catering supply chain What they are good at is not just selling drinks and What they are good at is not just selling drinks and food It's the more professional industrial system behind it It's the more professional industrial system behind it One of the key reasons Mixue is so successful is that they realise the importance of supply chain the importance of the supply chain the importance of the supply chain Let me tell you It was one of the first in the milk tea industry to build its own central factory In 2012, it built its own factory in Henan to process the purchased raw materials and sell them directly to franchisees. Later, as Mixue grew bigger and bigger the base of the supply chain also needs to be expanded so in order to reduce uncertainty about upstream ingredients, Mixue simply built the factory directly in the place of origin On Qichacha, I found out that Mixue has a subsidiary called Snow King Lemon. Now it has been renamed Snow King Agriculture. The registered place is in Anyue County, Ziyang City, Sichuan. Do you know where this is? It is the main producing area of ​​Eureka Lemon In this area, they directly cooperate with local farmers to collect lemons with zero intermediate cost This is why Mixue’s lemonade only sells for 4 yuan right? This is the first major benefit of building a self-built supply chain, reducing costs. This is not over yet. With the first advantage comes the second The second major benefit is to help it grow rapidly. Pay attention, this focus is on rapidity. As the saying goes, a good soldier is a good before the army moves the supplies must be in place You need to secure your base first before you can charge forward. Around the beginning of 2014, Mixue entered a rapid growth period, they built their own warehousing and logistics center. At the time they also made a very brave decision As a franchisee, you only need to buy raw materials and transportation is all free. This helped them quickly open up the domestic market. By the end of 2020, the number of stores exceeded 10, 000 By the end of 2021, the number of stores exceeded 20, 000 Mixue took 20 years to go from its first store to its 10, 000th store From the 10, 000th to 20, 000th stores it took only 1 year Untill now Mixue's supply chain is already very large Its upstream ingredients alone cover 35 countries around the world. From buying milk in New Zealand, cocoa from Ghana, cheese from Denmark and passion fruit from Vietnam. Michelle began to go overseas in 2018 and continue this franchise model. Backed by this global supply chain, Mixue soon surpass the local brands in Southeast Asia and is now the largest ready-made tea drink in the Southeast Asian market. By the end of last year, Mixue’s stores had exceeded 36, 000 stores ranking fourth in the world. Overseas stores also exceeded 4, 000. with such an extreme supply chain it helps reduce costs and ensure growth. So instead of calling it a milk tea brand it is better to say that it is a supply chain company disguised as milk tea shop This point is also very obvious from its financial data For example, if you look at Mixue’s prospectus The revenue in the first three quarters of 2023 is more than 15 billion, of which 98% is mainly from the sales of goods and equipment to franchisees. Franchise fees and related services only account for 1. 8%. Can you see that it's not a ToC company selling milk tea basically it is more like a "shovel seller" in the milk tea industry. and the role of shovel seller brings another benefit to Mixue The third benefit of its supply chain is to help Mixue reduce risks What does it mean For example, Mixue’s Eureka Lemon will also be supplied to other milk tea brands. Milk tea brands can come and go But being the upstream of the supply chain, as a lemon seller, as long as the lemon tea, lemonade market is growing, no matter what the milk tea brand is I'll still be growing It's similar to the brands in the new energy vehicle industry they come and gp But if I am a lithium battery seller, as long as new energy market is growing then I will be growing and will not be affected by certain new energy vehicle brands. So you see, the further upstream it goes in the supply chain the stronger its ability to resist risks and help it avoid risks best Milk tea is Red Sea Market Actually Mixue’s cooperation model with franchisees is selling products without sharing the profits Is it optimal? It needs to be discussed For example, if you look at these chain brands in Europe and the U. S McDonald's and Starbucks What they adopt is actually the brand takes a cut from the franchisee's profits essentially creating a deeper form of binding They think this is more conducive to long-term development In terms of scale, Mixue is now a stable leader. But the milk tea industry only exploded in the past 10 years or so So for Mixue the bigger question now may be how to continue this leading position and further expand globally. In addition to continuing to strengthen its position in the supply chain Mixue has another trick to build IP establish their own brand power Let me tell you there is a very interesting pattern in the consumer field, that is brand with lower price its stability is higher What does it mean? For example, if you want to go to a high-end restaurant, where the average spend could be several hundred or even thousands If I eat king crab today and eat foie gras tomorrow, it will be difficult for you to have that kind of if I want to eat good food, it's foie gras, foie gras, foie gras going to the same restaurants But the relatively low-priced ones are different. For example, home-cooked food. I just love eating Kung Pao Chicken and scrambled eggs with tomatoes I really just eat them all the time I'll order them from the restaurant nearby So what I want to say is that you will see that in the expensive market, there may be various brands competing but in the low-price market segment, there are usually only one or two top brands. In other words, it is very important to occupy the minds of users in the low-price market. Like Coke, right? When I eat a hamburger, I feel like I should have a Coke. When watching a football game I feel like I should have a Coke. When the whole family is having fun, I feel like I should open a can of Coke. For many people, it has even become a staple a happy water This is the brand perception that Coca-Cola has built in consumers' minds As for Mixue it hopes that when you're thirsty you'll think of Mixue's lemonade Build up the brand perception You see, the most common way to build brand perception is through advertising and find endorsements. But Mixue is different. They didn't go after those celebrity influencers they created their Snow King. Look at other milk tea and coffee shops they're teaming up with characters like Black Wukong r the Powerpuff Girls for IP collaborations But did you notice, Mixue rarely co-brands because Snow King is its own IP. Mixue launched this IP Snow King in 2018 later they built a whole cultural campaign around the Snow King In 2019, they designed a theme song for Snow King it's both catchy and addictive With over 30, 000 stores playing it it instantly becomes popular It was later spread through user-generated content online making it even more ingrained in people's minds Now, when you think of that song don't you immediately picture a chubby white character wobbling around in your head right? At the same time, the Snow King has been stirring things up on major social platforms making videos and accumulating a lot of followers Leveraging the booming IP trend in recent years it has created a standout IP in the consumer market Last year, Mixue launched an animation called Snow King Arrives It launched for free across the entire internet views have exceeded 200 million. The rating on Bilibili is as high as 9. 9. I even watched it to see what fancy marketing is Mixue doing, but I found that it didn’t mention milk tea at all It is about Snow King trying to find his ice cream scepter. It is just a pure animation This year, the second season of the animated series just launched Snow King: Fantasy Desert It features a Dunhuang-inspired backdrop with a strong traditional Chinese aesthetic Moreover, The voice actor from Black Myth: Wukong also participated in the Snow King's animation Animation and sound effect are quite sophisticated. You have to know that entering the cultural industry is not just a matter of testing the water. I even specifically asked my friends in the animation industry about it the production cost of an animation like Snow King, the cost per minute is about hundred of thousands Each season requires an investment of tens of millions And just this month (last month) Mixue was established a company called Snow King Loves Animation and registered a trademark for Snow King I checked this category it’s not advertising it is related to entertainment, movie production and etc. Even if Mixue isn't short on money they can do many other things why would it spend so much on making an animated series? Actually it's not difficult to understand that it launched the Snow King IP. Mixue's image itself is affordable and approachable There is really no need to spend a lot of money on high-end celebrities. There's also the risk of it backfiring as netizens often say It has more than 30, 000 offline stores, which is natural traffic so it doesn't need to spend a lot of money to find influencers and celebrities And this chubby white character has no border restrictions People around the globe love it right? This is quite smart and relatively easy to understand. So why do you think they are entering the cultural industry recently? Launching animated series and building a media company. Why? I think it is just like we analysed Mixue wants people to be familiar with it through the Snow King IP makes it easier to form an emotional connection Just having an IP or a single character isn’t enough on its own If this IP wants to have a long life it needs content to support it. I have to understand this IP what kind of character does it have what skills and flaws like a person only then it's easier to form emotional connection Through animation series I get more familiar with the character. It is actually a very good way to establish a companion IP. Like Doraemon, Crayon Shin-chan they are IP that has a profound impact on your childhood It gradually becomes an IP that has a deep impact on you When it comes to animated IPs there's a very successful predecessor Do you know who it is? Those who were born in the 1980s and 1990s must remember Haier brothers The theme song comes out as soon as you open your mouth. Maybe a lot of knowledge comes from these two brothers. When you watch the animated series you probably don't even know the Haier brand but through animated series and through content it subtly imprints this image in the minds of this generation After that, when you want to buy home appliances, this perception impact may affect your purchasing decision. It is actually a longer-term process. As for Snow King animation The plot is not complicated It is aimed at children young people The Snow King has an ice cream sceptre and magic Children will like it at first sight Then next time when you see Mixue you will think of the Snow King The impression is quite good Now it has registered a company called Snow King Loves Animation. Its business scope is movies, performances, and cultural communication. You can see that after some exploration it has pretty much decided what to do in this field As for what will happen in the future will it be like Disney a Snow King movie Snow King theme park or even world renowned Snowman It’s hard to say So you see The core of these animated series and cultural content is not to pursue a short-term hit or a wave of traffic but to have a longer-term vitality to connect with users through the IP of Snow King to build the user's perception. You see, after our analysis at first glance, Mixue seems to be a chain of freshly made tea companies. Upon closer inspection, we discovered that it is a supply chain company now about to expand into a cultural company. Don't you feel that the milk tea industry is still quite complex? Although from the number of stores, Mixue is closing on Starbucks but in terms of the degree of globalisation of revenue, there is still a long way to go. To become a benchmark tea brand it also has many challenges. For example, it mainly expanding in developing countries Can it enter developed countries in future Will this cost-effective route work The model of cooperation with franchisees does it need to be adjusted? Including what will the long-term effect of the current IP strategy be These questions are left to Mixue to think about I have to hurry up and plan our Xiao Lin Milk Tea Shop.
