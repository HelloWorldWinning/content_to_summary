Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Two Methods for Processing Mermaid Code:**
    *   Method 1: Deletion/Removal
        *   Removes non-Mermaid syntax from original code.
        *   Preserves original spatial relationships.
        *   Requires precise identification of "non-Mermaid" elements.
        *   Risks removing valid syntax if rules are imperfect.
    *   Method 2: Extraction and Reconstruction
        *   Extracts and reassembles Mermaid components.
        *   Allows control over structure and formatting.
        *   Requires deep understanding of Mermaid syntax.
        *   Risks missing valid components if not properly identified.

2.  **Key Comparison Points:**
    *   **Data Preservation Risk:** Method 1 risks accidental removal of valid code; Method 2 risks missed extractions.
    *   **Semantic Understanding:** Method 2 requires deeper understanding of Mermaid syntax.
    *   **Code Quality:** Method 2 produces cleaner, standardized output; Method 1 maintains original code's style.
    *   **Edge Cases:** Method 1 struggles with Mermaid-like text in comments/strings; Method 2 struggles with complex structures/formatting.

3.  **Core Point:** Two distinct approaches exist for handling Mermaid code, each with unique strengths and weaknesses regarding syntax manipulation and data preservation.

4.  **Fundamental Point:** The core distinction lies in whether to modify existing code (Method 1) or rebuild it from components (Method 2).

5. **Overarching Framework:** The content presents a comparative analysis of two methodologies for processing and cleaning Mermaid syntax, evaluating them based on risk, understanding, code quality, and edge-case handling.

Content:
Method 1 - Deletion/Removal Approach:
This method focuses on subtraction - removing everything that isn't valid Mermaid syntax. Think of it like sculpting, where you start with a block of marble and chip away everything that isn't part of the final sculpture. The advantage is that you're working directly with the original code structure, preserving the spatial relationships and overall architecture of the valid Mermaid components. However, this approach requires precise identification of what constitutes "non-Mermaid" elements, which can be challenging if the code is deeply intertwined or if there are ambiguous cases where syntax might be valid in both Mermaid and other contexts.
Method 2 - Extraction and Reconstruction:
This approach is more like gathering ingredients to bake a cake from scratch. You identify and extract the essential Mermaid components (nodes, relationships, styling elements) and then reassemble them in a clean format. This gives you more control over the final structure and allows you to enforce consistent formatting. It's particularly powerful when the original code is highly disorganized or when you want to implement specific architectural patterns in the reconstruction phase.
Key Comparison Points:

Data Preservation Risk: Method 1 might accidentally remove valid Mermaid code if the removal rules aren't perfect, while Method 2 might miss extracting some valid components if they're not properly identified during extraction.
Semantic Understanding: Method 2 requires deeper understanding of Mermaid syntax since you need to know how to properly reconstruct the relationships, while Method 1 operates more on pattern matching and removal.
Code Quality: Method 2 typically produces cleaner, more standardized output since you're rebuilding from scratch, while Method 1 maintains more of the original code's character (for better or worse).
Edge Cases: Method 1 might struggle with comments or string literals that contain Mermaid-like syntax, while Method 2 might have difficulty with complex nested structures or unusual formatting patterns.
