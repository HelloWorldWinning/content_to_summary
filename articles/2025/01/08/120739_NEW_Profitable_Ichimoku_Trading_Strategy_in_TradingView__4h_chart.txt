Description:
### Summary Outline:

1.  **Introduction of New Strategy:**
    *   Signum introduces a new trading strategy called "Ichimoku" for the 4-hour chart.
    *   Users can access it through the "Strategies" page on the Signum platform.
2.  **Accessing the Strategy:**
    *   Users can grant themselves access to the Ichimoku strategy, similar to the existing Goan Channel strategy.
    *   The strategy has demonstrated a 3.5% net profit on Bitcoin since 2018, with a drawdown of 33% and a 3.1 profit factor.
    *   It provides quicker trading signals.
    *   Default settings include: size 100, commission 0.1, and three-tick slippage.
3.  **Importance of Proper Settings & Avoiding Scams:**
    *   The video emphasizes that many online strategies use misleading settings to appear better than they are.
    *   Users are encouraged to watch another video on how to avoid such misleading strategies.
4.  **Signum Strategy Philosophy:**
    *   New strategies are shared on Signum via video explanations.
    *   Access to these strategies is considered valuable and primarily for the Signum community.
    *   Subscribing and enabling notifications is recommended to stay informed about new strategy releases.
5.  **Disclaimer & Call to Action:**
    *   The video is not financial advice. Trading crypto is risky, and losses are possible.
    *   Users are directed to watch a free trading playlist to enhance their trading knowledge.
6.  **Adding the Ichimoku Strategy to TradingView:**
    *   Instructions for adding the strategy to TradingView:
        *   Go to Signum and click "Strategies."
        *   Click "Open Strategy" then "Add to Favorites".
        *   Click "Get Access," then enter TradingView username.
        *   Reload TradingView to ensure the access takes effect.
        *   Find the strategy in your favorites under Indicators in TradingView.
    *   The strategy is designed for the Bitcoin USD index chart on a 4-hour timeframe.
7.  **Signum Strategy Value Proposition:**
    *   Signum strategies are exclusive to members.
    *   The service cost remains the same while providing more value by adding strategies.
    *   The goal is to create the best trading automation software with unique strategies.
    *   The 4-hour timeframe strategy provides sufficient signals for a 14-day trial.
    *   The trial begins after the first successful trade.
8.  **Performance Analysis & Strategy Overview:**
    *   The video shows how to remove signal labels for clarity.
    *   The Ichimoku strategy includes conversion lines, baseline periods, and lagging calculations.
    *   Examples of trades are shown, highlighting both winning (e.g., 47%, 57%) and losing trades (e.g., 4%, 7%)
    *   The strategy aims to stay in strong trends for extended periods.
    *   The strategy has a 3,000% profit since 2018, but with a 33% max drawdown.
    *   A series of losing trades can occur and need mental preparation from traders.
9.  **Strategy on Multiple Assets:**
    *   The Ichimoku strategy works on multiple assets, not just Bitcoin.
    *   Examples of performance on:
        *   Ethereum: 3,900% profit, 43% drawdown.
        *   Solana: 24,800% profit, 43% drawdown (best risk/reward).
        *   Render: 1,400% profit, 39% drawdown.
        *    Caspa: 1,300% profit, 43% Max drawdown
        *   Cardano: 15,800% profit, 45% drawdown.
    *   Not all assets perform well (e.g., Avac, Dogecoin with high drawdowns).
    *   Users should evaluate risk and reward for each asset.
    *   Combining multiple strategies and assets is suggested.
10. **Automating the Ichimoku Strategy:**
    *   Instructions on automating the strategy using Signum:
        *   Create or log in to a Signum account.
        *   Click on "Create Bot" and connect an exchange (e.g., Bybit).
        *   Follow the tutorials to connect each exchange with API.
        *   Copy the message from Signum.
        *   Add an alert in TradingView, pasting the copied message and webhook URL.
        *   The strategy is now fully automated.
11. **How Automation works:**
     *The automation triggers a buy or sell order based on the signals
    *  The bot trades between the trading pair e.g. BTC/USDT using the USDT to buy BTC on a buy signal and Selling BTC to USDT on a sell signal.
    *   The system alternates between buying and selling.

12. **Additional Resources**
    *   Consider joining the autotrading VIP masterclass.
    *   A video is linked that shows details on automating a trading strategy with signum

performance of this strategy and at the end of the align: start position: 0% of this strategy and at the end of the align: start position: 0% of this strategy and at the end of the video I will show you how to fully align: start position: 0% video I will show you how to fully align: start position: 0% video I will show you how to fully automate the trading signals from this align: start position: 0% automate the trading signals from this align: start position: 0% automate the trading signals from this strategy so it trades for you align: start position: 0% strategy so it trades for you align:

and night without you having to click any buttons it takes align: start position: 0% having to click any buttons it takes align: start position: 0% having to click any buttons it takes only 60 seconds but for that you need to align: start position: 0% only 60 seconds but for that you need to align: start position: 0% only 60 seconds but for that you need to watch the video Until the End because align: start position: 0% watch the video Until the End because align: start position: 0% watch the video Until the End because first you need to understand if you like align: start position: 0% first you need to understand if you like align: start position: 0% first you need to understand if you like the strategy so let's check it out back align: start position: 0% the strategy so let's check it out back align: start position: 0% the strategy so let's check it out back in trading view I am on the chart and I align: start position: 0% in trading view I am on the chart and I align: start position: 0% in trading view I am on the chart and I just added the strategy to my chart and align: start position: 0% just added the strategy to my chart and align: start position: 0% just added the strategy to my chart and as you can see I have all of these text align: start position: 0% as you can see I have all of these text align: start position: 0% as you can see I have all of these text and labels and everything and as always align: start position: 0% and labels and everything and as always align: start position: 0% and labels and everything and as always I don't like this label so I click on align: start position: 0% I don't like this label so I click on align: start position: 0% I don't like this label so I click on this settings icon go to style and I align: start position: 0% this settings icon go to style and I align: start position: 0% this settings icon go to style and I remove the signal labels and the align: start position: 0% remove the signal labels and the align: start position: 0% remove the signal labels and the quantity information I don't need that align: start position: 0% quantity information I don't need that align: start position: 0% quantity information I don't need that on the chart anyway because I'm going to align: start position: 0% on the chart anyway because I'm going to align: start position: 0% on the chart anyway because I'm going to follow the trading signals with my own align: start position: 0% follow the trading signals with my own align: start position: 0% follow the trading signals with my own budget okay it doesn't matter how much align: start position: 0% budget okay it doesn't matter how much align: start position: 0% budget okay it doesn't matter how much budget trading view has here right and align: start position: 0% budget trading view has here right and align: start position: 0% budget trading view has here right and for example let's check a couple of align: start position: 0% for example let's check a couple of align: start position: 0% for example let's check a couple of Trades so we see how the strategy Works align: start position: 0% Trades so we see how the strategy Works align: start position: 0% Trades so we see how the strategy Works in general so you have the ichimoku align: start position: 0% in general so you have the ichimoku align: start position: 0% in general so you have the ichimoku cloud and also by the way if you go to align: start position: 0% cloud and also by the way if you go to align: start position: 0% cloud and also by the way if you go to the inputs all of these inputs will of align: start position: 0% the inputs all of these inputs will of align: start position: 0% the inputs all of these inputs will of course influence the strategy right so align: start position: 0% course influence the strategy right so align: start position: 0% course influence the strategy right so there is a conversion line right the align: start position: 0% there is a conversion line right the align: start position: 0% there is a conversion line right the period of that line it's a moving align: start position: 0% period of that line it's a moving align: start position: 0% period of that line it's a moving average there is a baseline period and align: start position: 0% average there is a baseline period and align: start position: 0% average there is a baseline period and there is some lag that is taking into align: start position: 0% there is some lag that is taking into align: start position: 0% there is some lag that is taking into account displacement and EMA as well align: start position: 0% account displacement and EMA as well align: start position: 0% account displacement and EMA as well right so a lot of stuff I'm not going to align: start position: 0% right so a lot of stuff I'm not going to align: start position: 0% right so a lot of stuff I'm not going to go into Ultra detail because it will align: start position: 0% go into Ultra detail because it will align: start position: 0% go into Ultra detail because it will take forever right but all of these will align: start position: 0% take forever right but all of these will align: start position: 0% take forever right but all of these will play a role and those are not normal align: start position: 0% play a role and those are not normal align: start position: 0% play a role and those are not normal EMAs other than this one of course align: start position: 0% EMAs other than this one of course align: start position: 0% EMAs other than this one of course instead they are calculated in a very align: start position: 0% instead they are calculated in a very align: start position: 0% instead they are calculated in a very interesting way to be more sophisticated align: start position: 0% interesting way to be more sophisticated align: start position: 0% interesting way to be more sophisticated okay let's put it like that so as you align: start position: 0% okay let's put it like that so as you align: start position: 0% okay let's put it like that so as you can see here there was a trade from here align: start position: 0% can see here there was a trade from here align: start position: 0% can see here there was a trade from here to here and it took well 90 days in this align: start position: 0% to here and it took well 90 days in this align: start position: 0% to here and it took well 90 days in this case because it was a very strong trend align: start position: 0% case because it was a very strong trend align: start position: 0% case because it was a very strong trend so yeah if you were part of this you align: start position: 0% so yeah if you were part of this you align: start position: 0% so yeah if you were part of this you didn't get a lot of trading signals I'm align: start position: 0% didn't get a lot of trading signals I'm align: start position: 0% didn't get a lot of trading signals I'm sorry because the trend was so powerful align: start position: 0% sorry because the trend was so powerful align: start position: 0% sorry because the trend was so powerful that it wasn't a good idea to sell in align: start position: 0% that it wasn't a good idea to sell in align: start position: 0% that it wasn't a good idea to sell in the meantime and then buy back it didn't align: start position: 0% the meantime and then buy back it didn't align: start position: 0% the meantime and then buy back it didn't really make sense right it was better to align: start position: 0% really make sense right it was better to align: start position: 0% really make sense right it was better to stay in and basically take advantage of align: start position: 0% stay in and basically take advantage of align: start position: 0% stay in and basically take advantage of this right so it made 46% almost 47% align: start position: 0% this right so it made 46% almost 47% align: start position: 0% this right so it made 46% almost 47% profit that's very nice of course not align: start position: 0% profit that's very nice of course not align: start position: 0% profit that's very nice of course not always like that sometimes it also has align: start position: 0% always like that sometimes it also has align: start position: 0% always like that sometimes it also has losing trades here 4% here also a losing align: start position: 0% losing trades here 4% here also a losing align: start position: 0% losing trades here 4% here also a losing trade of 7% this stuff happens right and align: start position: 0% trade of 7% this stuff happens right and align: start position: 0% trade of 7% this stuff happens right and so whenever it finds nice long Trend align: start position: 0% so whenever it finds nice long Trend align: start position: 0% so whenever it finds nice long Trend then it stays in the trend for as long align: start position: 0% then it stays in the trend for as long align: start position: 0% then it stays in the trend for as long as it takes right so 47% that is very align: start position: 0% as it takes right so 47% that is very align: start position: 0% as it takes right so 47% that is very nice also here this was a very nice align: start position: 0% nice also here this was a very nice align: start position: 0% nice also here this was a very nice trade 57% right so all of that is align: start position: 0% trade 57% right so all of that is align: start position: 0% trade 57% right so all of that is amazing and in total right it started align: start position: 0% amazing and in total right it started align: start position: 0% amazing and in total right it started trading from 2018 so if I go way back align: start position: 0% trading from 2018 so if I go way back align: start position: 0% trading from 2018 so if I go way back then you see that the first trades align: start position: 0% then you see that the first trades align: start position: 0% then you see that the first trades started only here right there was no align: start position: 0% started only here right there was no align: start position: 0% started only here right there was no trading before 2018 because this is the align: start position: 0% trading before 2018 because this is the align: start position: 0% trading before 2018 because this is the period the date I told you to start from align: start position: 0% period the date I told you to start from align: start position: 0% period the date I told you to start from and that's because all the other align: start position: 0% and that's because all the other align: start position: 0% and that's because all the other strategies I use and I sure my YouTube align: start position: 0% strategies I use and I sure my YouTube align: start position: 0% strategies I use and I sure my YouTube channel they all start first of January align: start position: 0% channel they all start first of January align: start position: 0% channel they all start first of January 2018 so that we can compare the results align: start position: 0% 2018 so that we can compare the results align: start position: 0% 2018 so that we can compare the results otherwise it would be pretty hard to align: start position: 0% otherwise it would be pretty hard to align: start position: 0% otherwise it would be pretty hard to compare the results right and so this is align: start position: 0% compare the results right and so this is align: start position: 0% compare the results right and so this is what it is and you can see here the align: start position: 0% what it is and you can see here the align: start position: 0% what it is and you can see here the results of the strategy on bitcoin for align: start position: 0% results of the strategy on bitcoin for align: start position: 0% results of the strategy on bitcoin for the last seven years so these are the align: start position: 0% the last seven years so these are the align: start position: 0% the last seven years so these are the results it's pretty good but of course align: start position: 0% results it's pretty good but of course align: start position: 0% results it's pretty good but of course there is always something to comment align: start position: 0% there is always something to comment align: start position: 0% there is always something to comment about and in this case I would say that align: start position: 0% about and in this case I would say that align: start position: 0% about and in this case I would say that 35% profitable trade is maybe not align: start position: 0% 35% profitable trade is maybe not align: start position: 0% 35% profitable trade is maybe not amazing but it's fine okay if you just align: start position: 0% amazing but it's fine okay if you just align: start position: 0% amazing but it's fine okay if you just let it play out and you try to turn off align: start position: 0% let it play out and you try to turn off align: start position: 0% let it play out and you try to turn off your emotions right then you should be align: start position: 0% your emotions right then you should be align: start position: 0% your emotions right then you should be be getting a good result also the Max align: start position: 0% be getting a good result also the Max align: start position: 0% be getting a good result also the Max draw down of 33% is not the best but align: start position: 0% draw down of 33% is not the best but align: start position: 0% draw down of 33% is not the best but it's still very good for the result that align: start position: 0% it's still very good for the result that align: start position: 0% it's still very good for the result that you're getting here 3, 000% is amazing align: start position: 0% you're getting here 3, 000% is amazing align: start position: 0% you're getting here 3, 000% is amazing and if you go to the list of Trades you align: start position: 0% and if you go to the list of Trades you align: start position: 0% and if you go to the list of Trades you can see there are a couple of losing align: start position: 0% can see there are a couple of losing align: start position: 0% can see there are a couple of losing trades in a row and that is because the align: start position: 0% trades in a row and that is because the align: start position: 0% trades in a row and that is because the percent profitable trades is not that align: start position: 0% percent profitable trades is not that align: start position: 0% percent profitable trades is not that high so you need to mentally prepare align: start position: 0% high so you need to mentally prepare align: start position: 0% high so you need to mentally prepare that this can happen is fully part of align: start position: 0% that this can happen is fully part of align: start position: 0% that this can happen is fully part of the game right so sometimes it has a lot align: start position: 0% the game right so sometimes it has a lot align: start position: 0% the game right so sometimes it has a lot of losing trades in a row so you need to align: start position: 0% of losing trades in a row so you need to align: start position: 0% of losing trades in a row so you need to get prepared for that and that's why align: start position: 0% get prepared for that and that's why align: start position: 0% get prepared for that and that's why this strategy has a lower and profitable align: start position: 0% this strategy has a lower and profitable align: start position: 0% this strategy has a lower and profitable trades mathematically it still works align: start position: 0% trades mathematically it still works align: start position: 0% trades mathematically it still works fine but you need to just prepare and align: start position: 0% fine but you need to just prepare and align: start position: 0% fine but you need to just prepare and not freak out okay so that is one thing align: start position: 0% not freak out okay so that is one thing align: start position: 0% not freak out okay so that is one thing you need to understand now the next align: start position: 0% you need to understand now the next align: start position: 0% you need to understand now the next thing I want to show you is how it align: start position: 0% thing I want to show you is how it align: start position: 0% thing I want to show you is how it performs on some other popular assets so align: start position: 0% performs on some other popular assets so align: start position: 0% performs on some other popular assets so you can see that this is not just align: start position: 0% you can see that this is not just align: start position: 0% you can see that this is not just working on bitcoin it's not a overfitted align: start position: 0% working on bitcoin it's not a overfitted align: start position: 0% working on bitcoin it's not a overfitted strategy for Bitcoin only instead it is align: start position: 0% strategy for Bitcoin only instead it is align: start position: 0% strategy for Bitcoin only instead it is a robust strategy that can work on align: start position: 0% a robust strategy that can work on align: start position: 0% a robust strategy that can work on multiple assets and I'm going to show align: start position: 0% multiple assets and I'm going to show align: start position: 0% multiple assets and I'm going to show you a couple and then you can take the align: start position: 0% you a couple and then you can take the align: start position: 0% you a couple and then you can take the strategy and go bananas and use it on align: start position: 0% strategy and go bananas and use it on align: start position: 0% strategy and go bananas and use it on whatever you like but stay in the crypto align: start position: 0% whatever you like but stay in the crypto align: start position: 0% whatever you like but stay in the crypto Universe because crypto is very much align: start position: 0% Universe because crypto is very much align: start position: 0% Universe because crypto is very much trending and this is a trend following align: start position: 0% trending and this is a trend following align: start position: 0% trending and this is a trend following strategy but on a 4-Hour chart but do align: start position: 0% strategy but on a 4-Hour chart but do align: start position: 0% strategy but on a 4-Hour chart but do whatever you like because this is not align: start position: 0% whatever you like because this is not align: start position: 0% whatever you like because this is not Financial advice just education let's align: start position: 0% Financial advice just education let's align: start position: 0% Financial advice just education let's check the exact same strategy on align: start position: 0% check the exact same strategy on align: start position: 0% check the exact same strategy on altcoins and see how it performed over align: start position: 0% altcoins and see how it performed over align: start position: 0% altcoins and see how it performed over there I will put myself on the bottom align: start position: 0% there I will put myself on the bottom align: start position: 0% there I will put myself on the bottom here and I will not touch any of the align: start position: 0% here and I will not touch any of the align: start position: 0% here and I will not touch any of the settings right this is the strategy on align: start position: 0% settings right this is the strategy on align: start position: 0% settings right this is the strategy on bitcoin look at the numbers same numbers align: start position: 0% bitcoin look at the numbers same numbers align: start position: 0% bitcoin look at the numbers same numbers as before now only thing I will change align: start position: 0% as before now only thing I will change align: start position: 0% as before now only thing I will change is the asset that I show on the chart align: start position: 0% is the asset that I show on the chart align: start position: 0% is the asset that I show on the chart the asset that we're going to also apply align: start position: 0% the asset that we're going to also apply align: start position: 0% the asset that we're going to also apply the strategy on so I will just click on align: start position: 0% the strategy on so I will just click on align: start position: 0% the strategy on so I will just click on ethereum for example so we can see here align: start position: 0% ethereum for example so we can see here align: start position: 0% ethereum for example so we can see here on the ethereum by the way ethereum align: start position: 0% on the ethereum by the way ethereum align: start position: 0% on the ethereum by the way ethereum index chart right you can see here 4 align: start position: 0% index chart right you can see here 4 align: start position: 0% index chart right you can see here 4 hours all the time right we can see align: start position: 0% hours all the time right we can see align: start position: 0% hours all the time right we can see 3, 900 profit with a draw down of 43% I align: start position: 0% 3, 900 profit with a draw down of 43% I align: start position: 0% 3, 900 profit with a draw down of 43% I think risk reward is quite okay on this align: start position: 0% think risk reward is quite okay on this align: start position: 0% think risk reward is quite okay on this one sure they are better strategies but align: start position: 0% one sure they are better strategies but align: start position: 0% one sure they are better strategies but it actually performs quite well on this align: start position: 0% it actually performs quite well on this align: start position: 0% it actually performs quite well on this very important asset on Solana you can align: start position: 0% very important asset on Solana you can align: start position: 0% very important asset on Solana you can see it made align: start position: 0% see it made align: start position: 0% see it made 24, 800 per profit which is actually align: start position: 0% 24, 800 per profit which is actually align: start position: 0% 24, 800 per profit which is actually 248x profit that is crazy okay the draw align: start position: 0% 248x profit that is crazy okay the draw align: start position: 0% 248x profit that is crazy okay the draw down with 43% is actually quite good align: start position: 0% down with 43% is actually quite good align: start position: 0% down with 43% is actually quite good because of the massive profit that is align: start position: 0% because of the massive profit that is align: start position: 0% because of the massive profit that is generating so it's actually even better align: start position: 0% generating so it's actually even better align: start position: 0% generating so it's actually even better than the ethereum performance right align: start position: 0% than the ethereum performance right align: start position: 0% than the ethereum performance right let's go to Rena to see a very different align: start position: 0% let's go to Rena to see a very different align: start position: 0% let's go to Rena to see a very different asset on Rena you see, 1400% profit with align: start position: 0% asset on Rena you see, 1400% profit with align: start position: 0% asset on Rena you see, 1400% profit with 39% Max Throwdown which again is okay align: start position: 0% 39% Max Throwdown which again is okay align: start position: 0% 39% Max Throwdown which again is okay for this asset but the best risk reward align: start position: 0% for this asset but the best risk reward align: start position: 0% for this asset but the best risk reward was still Solana so far let's go to align: start position: 0% was still Solana so far let's go to align: start position: 0% was still Solana so far let's go to Caspa right Cas made 1, 300% profit with align: start position: 0% Caspa right Cas made 1, 300% profit with align: start position: 0% Caspa right Cas made 1, 300% profit with 43% Max draw down which is very align: start position: 0% 43% Max draw down which is very align: start position: 0% 43% Max draw down which is very interesting because you see that this align: start position: 0% interesting because you see that this align: start position: 0% interesting because you see that this Str very often has 43% draw down so if align: start position: 0% Str very often has 43% draw down so if align: start position: 0% Str very often has 43% draw down so if you can live with that then this align: start position: 0% you can live with that then this align: start position: 0% you can live with that then this strategy can work on many assets quite align: start position: 0% strategy can work on many assets quite align: start position: 0% strategy can work on many assets quite well and also let me show you cardano align: start position: 0% well and also let me show you cardano align: start position: 0% well and also let me show you cardano because it's quite popular lately right align: start position: 0% because it's quite popular lately right align: start position: 0% because it's quite popular lately right so you see align: start position: 0% so you see align: start position: 0% so you see 15, 800 profit since 2018 and with the align: start position: 0% 15, 800 profit since 2018 and with the align: start position: 0% 15, 800 profit since 2018 and with the draw down of 45% again very close to the align: start position: 0% draw down of 45% again very close to the align: start position: 0% draw down of 45% again very close to the 40% is Max draw down so that is nice and align: start position: 0% 40% is Max draw down so that is nice and align: start position: 0% 40% is Max draw down so that is nice and those coins work very well there but if align: start position: 0% those coins work very well there but if align: start position: 0% those coins work very well there but if we go to avac for example you see the align: start position: 0% we go to avac for example you see the align: start position: 0% we go to avac for example you see the max drown is 91% you go to to Dogecoin align: start position: 0% max drown is 91% you go to to Dogecoin align: start position: 0% max drown is 91% you go to to Dogecoin you see 62% so you have to make sure align: start position: 0% you see 62% so you have to make sure align: start position: 0% you see 62% so you have to make sure right that you find the coin strategy align: start position: 0% right that you find the coin strategy align: start position: 0% right that you find the coin strategy combination that you can actually live align: start position: 0% combination that you can actually live align: start position: 0% combination that you can actually live with so that the risk reward is in your align: start position: 0% with so that the risk reward is in your align: start position: 0% with so that the risk reward is in your favor having said that this strategy align: start position: 0% favor having said that this strategy align: start position: 0% favor having said that this strategy works on hundreds of assets I showed you align: start position: 0% works on hundreds of assets I showed you align: start position: 0% works on hundreds of assets I showed you a couple where it performs well and a align: start position: 0% a couple where it performs well and a align: start position: 0% a couple where it performs well and a couple where it doesn't perform well so align: start position: 0% couple where it doesn't perform well so align: start position: 0% couple where it doesn't perform well so of course when you are using this align: start position: 0% of course when you are using this align: start position: 0% of course when you are using this strategy you always have to make your align: start position: 0% strategy you always have to make your align: start position: 0% strategy you always have to make your calculations if the Max draw down the align: start position: 0% calculations if the Max draw down the align: start position: 0% calculations if the Max draw down the risk basically that you're taking is align: start position: 0% risk basically that you're taking is align: start position: 0% risk basically that you're taking is worth it okay so it might not work on align: start position: 0% worth it okay so it might not work on align: start position: 0% worth it okay so it might not work on every single coin but then again you can align: start position: 0% every single coin but then again you can align: start position: 0% every single coin but then again you can try the Gan channel strategy in that align: start position: 0% try the Gan channel strategy in that align: start position: 0% try the Gan channel strategy in that case right so you can always combine align: start position: 0% case right so you can always combine align: start position: 0% case right so you can always combine these two strategies to create a align: start position: 0% these two strategies to create a align: start position: 0% these two strategies to create a portfolio of multiple strategies align: start position: 0% portfolio of multiple strategies align: start position: 0% portfolio of multiple strategies multiple assets that you can automate align: start position: 0% multiple assets that you can automate align: start position: 0% multiple assets that you can automate and then in total you want your align: start position: 0% and then in total you want your align: start position: 0% and then in total you want your portfolio to grow right it's not only align: start position: 0% portfolio to grow right it's not only align: start position: 0% portfolio to grow right it's not only about one coin it's about the whole align: start position: 0% about one coin it's about the whole align: start position: 0% about one coin it's about the whole portfolio right that is why Signum is so align: start position: 0% portfolio right that is why Signum is so align: start position: 0% portfolio right that is why Signum is so powerful because it allows you to align: start position: 0% powerful because it allows you to align: start position: 0% powerful because it allows you to automate a portfolio of coins and you align: start position: 0% automate a portfolio of coins and you align: start position: 0% automate a portfolio of coins and you don't have to babysit them right because align: start position: 0% don't have to babysit them right because align: start position: 0% don't have to babysit them right because you fully automated them and with time align: start position: 0% you fully automated them and with time align: start position: 0% you fully automated them and with time you're going to have access to more and align: start position: 0% you're going to have access to more and align: start position: 0% you're going to have access to more and more strategies and this way I think align: start position: 0% more strategies and this way I think align: start position: 0% more strategies and this way I think that you're definitely better off than align: start position: 0% that you're definitely better off than align: start position: 0% that you're definitely better off than anyone else who doesn't have access to align: start position: 0% anyone else who doesn't have access to align: start position: 0% anyone else who doesn't have access to these things and talking about align: start position: 0% these things and talking about align: start position: 0% these things and talking about Automation in the next section of this align: start position: 0% Automation in the next section of this align: start position: 0% Automation in the next section of this video right now I want to show you how align: start position: 0% video right now I want to show you how align: start position: 0% video right now I

want to use and I check align: start position: 0% strategy that I want to use and I check the numbers to make sure this is the align: start position: 0% the numbers to make sure this is the align: start position: 0% the numbers to make sure this is the performance that I'm automating for align: start position: 0% performance that I'm automating for align: start position: 0% performance that I'm automating for right that's the one I want great so I align: start position: 0% right that's the one I want great so I align: start position: 0% right that's the one I want great so I click on this particular ADD alert icon align: start position: 0% click on this particular ADD alert icon align: start position: 0% click on this particular ADD alert icon not any other one this one because it's align: start position: 0% not any other one this one because it's align: start position: 0% not any other one this one because it's next to the strategy and that's align: start position: 0% next to the strategy and that's align: start position: 0% next to the strategy and that's important because it has the condition align: start position: 0% important because it has the condition align: start position: 0% important because it has the condition of the strategy itself so when the align: start position: 0% of the strategy itself so when the align: start position: 0% of the strategy itself so when the strategy comes up with a buy or sell align: start position: 0% strategy comes up with a buy or sell align: start position: 0% strategy comes up with a buy or sell then trigger all of this stuff and send align: start position: 0% then trigger all of this stuff and send align: start position: 0% then trigger all of this stuff and send it to Signum right so delete whatever is align: start

actually right go back to trading view paste it here let's put the align: start position: 0% trading view paste it here let's put the align: start position: 0% trading view paste it here let's put the alert name as well go back to copy the align: start position: 0% alert name as well go back to copy the align: start position: 0% alert name as well go back to copy the alert name as well the alert name is not align: start position: 0% alert name as well the alert name is not align: start position: 0% alert name as well the alert name is not super important you can put whatever you align: start position: 0% super important you can put whatever you align: start position: 0% super important you can put whatever you like it doesn't affect the automation align: start position: 0% like it doesn't affect the automation align: start position: 0% like it doesn't affect the automation but it simply make your life easier align: start position: 0% but it simply make your life easier align: start position: 0% but it simply make your life easier right to have the same name as in Signum align: start position: 0% right to have the same name as in Signum align: start position: 0% right to have the same name as in Signum and the next thing you need to copy the align: start position: 0% and the next thing you need to copy the align: start position: 0% and the next thing you need to copy the web hook URL so the signal knows where align: start position: 0% web hook URL so the signal knows where align: start position: 0% web hook URL so the signal knows where to go right so make sure to turn on align: start position: 0% to go right so make sure to turn on align: start position: 0% to go right so make sure to turn on webhook URL right put in this particular align: start position: 0% webhook URL right put in this particular align: start position: 0% webhook URL right put in this particular URL click create and that's it right now align: start position: 0% URL click create and that's it right now align: start position: 0% URL click create and that's it right now your strategy is fully automated right align: start position: 0% your strategy is fully automated right align: start position: 0% your strategy is fully automated right that's crazy easy right cuz it doesn't align: start position: 0% that's crazy easy right cuz it doesn't align: start position: 0% that's crazy easy right cuz it doesn't look like much but it is a lot okay align: start position: 0% look like much but it is a lot okay align: start position: 0% look like much but it is a lot okay because now every single signal that align: start position: 0% because now every single signal that align: start position: 0% because now every single signal that comes from the strategy will be sent to align: start position: 0% comes from the strategy will be sent to align: start position: 0% comes from the strategy will be sent to Signum okay and Signum will then take align: start position: 0% Signum okay and Signum will then take align: start position: 0% Signum okay and Signum will then take this and it will automatically buy and align: start position: 0% this and it will automatically buy and align: start position: 0% this and it will automatically buy and sell on this connected account and on align: start position: 0% sell on this connected account and on align: start position: 0% sell on this connected account and on this account you have these assets and align: start position: 0% this account you have these assets and align: start position: 0% this account you have these assets and it will trade between Bitcoin and usdt align: start position: 0% it will trade between Bitcoin and usdt align: start position: 0% it will trade between Bitcoin and usdt back and forth right you can see here it align: start position: 0% back and forth right you can see here it align: start position: 0% back and forth right you can see here it will use usdt when buying of course align: start position: 0% will use usdt when buying of course align: start position: 0% will use usdt when buying of course right so it will take the usdt and buy align: start position: 0% right so it will take the usdt and buy align: start position: 0% right so it will take the usdt and buy Bitcoin with it when there is a Buy align: start position: 0% Bitcoin with it when there is a Buy align: start position: 0% Bitcoin with it when there is a Buy Signal and it will take Bitcoin and sell align: start position: 0% Signal and it will take Bitcoin and sell align: start position: 0% Signal and it will take Bitcoin and sell it for usdt when there is a sell signal align: start position: 0% it for usdt when there is a sell signal align: start position: 0% it for usdt when there is a sell signal and that's why the trading pair matters align: start position: 0% and that's why the trading pair matters align: start position: 0% and that's why the trading pair matters because it switches between between BTC align: start position: 0% because it switches between between BTC align: start position: 0% because it switches between between BTC usdt BTC usdt depending on the buy or align: start position: 0% usdt BTC usdt depending on the buy or align: start position: 0% usdt BTC usdt depending on the buy or sell signals right and also keep in mind align: start position: 0% sell signals right and also keep in mind align: start position: 0% sell signals right and also keep in mind that you can check the alert that you align: start position: 0% that you can check the alert that you align: start position: 0% that you can check the alert that you have just created by clicking here and align: start position: 0% have just created by clicking here and align: start position: 0% have just created by clicking here and you find the alert and this is the one align: start position: 0% you find the alert and this is the one align: start position: 0% you find the alert and this is the one that actually triggers the whole thing align: start position: 0% that actually triggers the whole thing align: start position: 0% that actually triggers the whole thing right so whenever this alert triggers it align: start position: 0% right so whenever this alert triggers it align: start position: 0% right so whenever this alert triggers it will go to Signum and the whole chain of align: start position: 0% will go to Signum and the whole chain of align: start position: 0% will go to Signum and the whole chain of events will happen right so that is the align: start position: 0% events will happen right so that is the align: start position: 0% events will happen right so that is the magic it's very easy right I know it's align: start position: 0% magic it's very easy right I know it's align: start position: 0% magic it's very easy right I know it's very easy it's very powerful as well and align: start position: 0% very easy it's very powerful as well and align: start position: 0% very easy it's very powerful as well and one more thing I want to tell you is align: start position: 0% one more thing I want to tell you is align: start position: 0% one more thing I want to tell you is that this strategy is alternating align: start position: 0% that this strategy is alternating align: start position: 0% that this strategy is alternating between buying and selling okay so it align: start position: 0% between buying and selling okay so it align: start position: 0% between buying and selling okay so it doesn't go short or anything right so align: start position: 0% doesn't go short or anything right so align: start position: 0% doesn't go short or anything right so whenever you have a Buy Signal it will align: start position: 0% whenever you have a Buy Signal it will align: start position: 0% whenever you have a Buy Signal it will wait for the sell signal right so the align: start position: 0% wait for the sell signal right so the align: start position: 0% wait for the sell signal right so the next one is the sell and when the sell align: start position: 0% next one is the sell and when the sell align: start position: 0% next one is the sell and when the sell signal was the last one then the next align: start position: 0% signal was the last one then the next align: start position: 0% signal was the last one then the next one that you wait for because here you align: start position: 0% one that you wait for because here you align: start position: 0% one that you wait for because here you created the alert right now you're align: start position: 0% created the alert right now you're align: start position: 0% created the alert right now you're waiting for signals to happen in the align: start position: 0% waiting for signals to happen in the align: start position: 0% waiting for signals to happen in the future the next signal will be a Buy align: start position: 0% future the next signal will be a Buy align: start position: 0% future the next signal will be a Buy Signal at some point right because it's align: start position: 0% Signal at some point right because it's align: start position: 0% Signal at some point right because it's always buy sell Buy sell Buy sell right align: start position: 0% always buy sell Buy sell Buy sell right align: start position: 0% always buy sell Buy sell Buy sell right so you're now waiting patiently align: start position: 0% so you're now waiting patiently align: start position: 0% so you're now waiting patiently patiently okay for the next signal to align: start position: 0% patiently okay for the next signal to align: start position: 0% patiently okay for the next signal to happen and whenever there is a buy align: start position: 0% happen and whenever there is a buy align: start position: 0% happen and whenever there is a buy signal again it will be send through the align: start position: 0% signal again it will be send through the align: start position: 0% signal again it will be send through the web hook that you have set up here to align: start position: 0% web hook that you have set up here to align: start position: 0% web hook that you have set up here to Signum and Signum will
