Description:
### Summary:

**I. Trading Strategy Overview**

   *   **Core Indicators:** Utilizes a combination of three indicators: Stochastic RSI, RSI, and MACD.
   *   **Stochastic RSI:** Identifies overbought and oversold levels; serves as the primary entry signal generator.
   *   **RSI:** Modified to be a trend confirmation indicator (using 50 as the middle line), not overbought/oversold.
   *   **MACD:** Used to confirm momentum, not for direct buy/sell signals.

**II. Entry Signals**

   *   **Buy Signal:**
        *   Stochastic RSI: Both K and D lines in oversold territory.
        *   RSI: Above the middle line (50).
        *   MACD: Line crosses above the signal line.
        *   Stochastic lines should not yet be overbought.
   *   **Sell Signal:**
        *   Stochastic RSI: Both K and D lines in overbought territory.
        *   RSI: Below the middle line (50).
        *   MACD: Line crosses below the signal line.
        *  Stochastic lines should not yet be oversold.

**III. Exit Strategy**

    *   **Stop Loss:**
        *   Buy Positions: Below the nearest swing low.
        *   Sell Positions: Above the nearest swing high.
    *   **Profit Target:** Set at 1.5 times the stop loss.

**IV. Backtesting Results**

   *   100 trades on EUR/USD 30-minute timeframe.
   *   56% win rate.
   *   Profit of $280.41 (28% gain on $1000 capital).

**V. Optimization Tips**

   *   **Limit Stop Loss:** To 0.15% of capital to reduce potential losses.
   *   **One Trade at a Time:** Avoid opening new positions before closing previous ones for better management.

**Core Point:** This trading strategy combines Stochastic RSI, RSI, and MACD to identify high probability trading opportunities by confirming entry signals, trend direction, and momentum.

**Fundamental Point:** Combining multiple indicators with specific roles, rather than using them in isolation, provides a more robust and reliable trading strategy that yields positive results.

**Overarching Framework:** The framework is a structured trading strategy that uses a combination of indicators for entry, exit, trend and momentum confirmation, followed by backtesting to validate the strategy and optimization for better results.

video for this strategy align: start position: 0% strategy align: start position: 0% strategy we are using a combination of three align: start position: 0% we are using a combination of three align: start position: 0% we are using a combination of three indicators align: start position: 0% indicators align: start position: 0% indicators the stochastic rsi align: start position: 0% the stochastic rsi align: start position: 0% the stochastic rsi and macd first let's start with the align: start position: 0% and macd first let's start with the align: start position: 0% and macd first let's start with the stochastic align: start position: 0% stochastic align: start position: 0% stochastic because that will generate our main align: start position: 0% because that will generate our main align: start position: 0% because that will generate our main entry signal align: start position: 0% entry signal align: start position: 0% entry signal the stochastic is a very simple to use align: start position: 0% the stochastic is a very simple to use align: start position: 0% the stochastic is a very simple to use indicator align: start position: 0% indicator align: start position: 0% indicator that does a very good job of identifying align: start position: 0% that does a very good job of identifying align: start position: 0% that does a very good job of identifying overbought align: start position: 0% overbought align: start position: 0% overbought and oversold levels on the market align: start position: 0% and oversold levels on the market align: start position: 0% and oversold levels on the market it consists of two parts the blue line align: start position: 0% it consists of two parts the blue line align: start position: 0% it consists of two parts the blue line which is called the k align: start position: 0% which is called the k align: start position: 0% which is called the k percentage and the orange line which is align: start position: 0% percentage and the orange line which is align: start position: 0% percentage and the orange line which is called the d percentage align: start position: 0% called the d percentage align: start position: 0% called the d percentage one of the most common mistakes that align: start position: 0% one of the most common mistakes that align: start position: 0% one of the most common mistakes that traders make when using this indicator align: start position: 0% traders make when using this indicator align: start position: 0% traders make when using this indicator is that they're trading the stochastic align: start position: 0% is that they're trading the stochastic align: start position: 0% is that they're trading the stochastic by itself align: start position: 0% by itself align: start position: 0% by itself so they take a buy position every time align: start position: 0% so they take a buy position every time align: start position: 0% so they take a buy position every time the indicator hits oversold align: start position: 0% the indicator hits oversold align: start position: 0% the indicator hits oversold and they take a sell position every time align: start position: 0% and they take a sell position every time align: start position: 0% and they take a sell position every time the indicator hits overbought align: start position: 0% the indicator hits overbought align: start position: 0% the indicator hits overbought if you're still using the indicator this align: start position: 0% if you're still using the indicator this align: start position: 0% if you're still using the indicator this way you will get a very low win rate align: start position: 0% way you will get a very low win rate align: start position: 0% way you will get a very low win rate instead you need to combine the align: start position: 0% instead you need to combine the align: start position: 0% instead you need to combine the stochastic with align: start position: 0% stochastic with align: start position: 0% stochastic with other indicators to further confirm your align: start position: 0% other indicators to further confirm your align: start position: 0% other indicators to further confirm your analysis align: start position: 0% analysis align: start position: 0% analysis and so let's move on to the second align: start position: 0% and so let's move on to the second align: start position: 0% and so let's move on to the second indicator for our strategy align: start position: 0% indicator for our strategy align: start position: 0% indicator for our strategy which is the rsi the rsi align: start position: 0% which is the rsi the rsi align: start position: 0% which is the rsi the rsi is one of the most famous indicators align: start position: 0% is one of the most famous indicators align: start position: 0% is one of the most famous indicators used in trading align: start position: 0% used in trading align: start position: 0% used in trading and a popular way of using the rsi is by align: start position: 0% and a popular way of using the rsi is by align: start position: 0% and a popular way of using the rsi is by trading it as an overbought align: start position: 0% trading it as an overbought align: start position: 0% trading it as an overbought and oversold indicator however align: start position: 0% and oversold indicator however align: start position: 0% and oversold indicator however for this combination strategy we already align: start position: 0% for this combination strategy we already align: start position: 0% for this combination strategy we already have the stochastic to do that job align: start position: 0% have the stochastic to do that job align: start position: 0% have the stochastic to do that job so having two indicators that give the align: start position: 0% so having two indicators that give the align: start position: 0% so having two indicators that give the same signals is quite useless align: start position: 0% same signals is quite useless align: start position: 0% same signals is quite useless instead we are using the rsi as a trend align: start position: 0% instead we are using the rsi as a trend align: start position: 0% instead we are using the rsi as a trend confirmation indicator and align: start position: 0% confirmation indicator and align: start position: 0% confirmation indicator and to do that first we need to go to the align: start position: 0% to do that first we need to go to the align: start position: 0% to do that first we need to go to the indicator settings align: start position: 0% indicator settings align: start position: 0% indicator settings and change both of these levels to 50. align: start position: 0% and change both of these levels to 50. align: start position: 0% and change both of these levels to 50. so now we have a single line in the align: start position: 0% so now we have a single line in the align: start position: 0% so now we have a single line in the middle like this align: start position: 0% middle like this align: start position: 0% middle like this and the way we use it to confirm a trend align: start position: 0% and the way we use it to confirm a trend align: start position: 0% and the way we use it to confirm a trend is very simple align: start position: 0% is very simple align: start position: 0% is very simple if the rsi is above the middle line it align: start position: 0% if the rsi is above the middle line it align: start position: 0% if the rsi is above the middle line it means that the price is on an uptrend align: start position: 0% means that the price is on an uptrend align: start position: 0% means that the price is on an uptrend so you only take buy positions and if align: start position: 0% so you only take buy positions and if align: start position: 0% so you only take buy positions and if the rsi is below the middle line align: start position: 0% the rsi is below the middle line align: start position: 0% the rsi is below the middle line it means that the price is on a align: start position: 0% it means that the price is on a align: start position: 0% it means that the price is on a downtrend so you only take align: start position: 0% downtrend so you only take align: start position: 0% downtrend so you only take cell positions now let's move on to the align: start position: 0% cell positions now let's move on to the align: start position: 0% cell positions now let's move on to the third indicator align: start position: 0% third indicator align: start position: 0% third indicator which is the macd the macd is one of the align: start position: 0% which is the macd the macd is one of the align: start position: 0% which is the macd the macd is one of the most popular indicators that does a very align: start position: 0% most popular indicators that does a very align: start position: 0% most popular indicators that does a very good job of detecting momentum align: start position: 0% good job of detecting momentum align: start position: 0% good job of detecting momentum and a common way of using the macd is by align: start position: 0% and a common way of using the macd is by align: start position: 0% and a common way of using the macd is by taking a buy position if the macd line align: start position: 0% taking a buy position if the macd line align: start position: 0% taking a buy position if the macd line crosses above the signal line align: start position: 0% crosses above the signal line align: start position: 0% crosses above the signal line and taking a cell position if the macd align: start position: 0% and taking a cell position if the macd align: start position: 0% and taking a cell position if the macd line crosses below the signal line align: start position: 0% line crosses below the signal line align: start position: 0% line crosses below the signal line however this strategy only works if the align: start position: 0% however this strategy only works if the align: start position: 0% however this strategy only works if the market is trending align: start position: 0% market is trending align: start position: 0% market is trending if the market is moving sideways the align: start position: 0% if the market is moving sideways the align: start position: 0% if the market is moving sideways the macd align: start position: 0% macd align: start position: 0% macd often gives false signals so that is why align: start position: 0% often gives false signals so that is why align: start position: 0% often gives false signals so that is why for this combination strategy align: start position: 0% for this combination strategy align: start position: 0% for this combination strategy we are not going to buy or sell just align: start position: 0% we are not going to buy or sell just align: start position: 0% we are not going to buy or sell just because the macd crosses over align: start position: 0% because the macd crosses over align: start position: 0% because the macd crosses over instead we are using it to give extra align: start position: 0% instead we are using it to give extra align: start position: 0% instead we are using it to give extra confirmation align: start position: 0% confirmation align: start position: 0% confirmation and making sure that the momentum is on align: start position: 0% and making sure that the momentum is on align: start position: 0% and making sure that the momentum is on our side align: start position: 0% our side align: start position: 0% our side and so this is how the stochastic rsi align: start position: 0% and so this is how the stochastic rsi align: start position: 0% and so this is how the stochastic rsi and macd strategy works first align: start position: 0% and macd strategy works first align: start position: 0% and macd strategy works first let's start with their entry signal to align: start position: 0% let's start with their entry signal to align: start position: 0% let's start with their entry signal to identify align: start position: 0% identify align: start position: 0% identify a buy signal the first step is you want align: start position: 0% a buy signal the first step is you want align: start position: 0% a buy signal the first step is you want to look at the stochastic align: start position: 0% to look at the stochastic align: start position: 0% to look at the stochastic and wait for both the k and d lines to align: start position: 0% and wait for both the k and d lines to align: start position: 0% and wait for both the k and d lines to hit oversold align: start position: 0% hit oversold align: start position: 0% hit oversold then you want to use the rsi to confirm align: start position: 0% then you want to use the rsi to confirm align: start position: 0% then you want to use the rsi to confirm the uptrend align: start position: 0% the uptrend align: start position: 0% the uptrend by making sure that it's above the align: start position: 0% by making sure that it's above the align: start position: 0% by making sure that it's above the middle line align: start position: 0% middle line align: start position: 0% middle line the next step is you want to use the align: start position: 0% the next step is you want to use the align: start position: 0% the next step is you want to use the macd to confirm the upwards momentum align: start position: 0% macd to confirm the upwards momentum align: start position: 0% macd to confirm the upwards momentum by waiting for the macd line to cross align: start position: 0% by waiting for the macd line to cross align: start position: 0% by waiting for the macd line to cross above the signal line align: start position: 0% above the signal line align: start position: 0% above the signal line once this happens however you still need align: start position: 0% once this happens however you still need align: start position: 0% once this happens however you still need to make sure that both of the stochastic align: start position: 0% to make sure that both of the stochastic align: start position: 0% to make sure that both of the stochastic lines still hasn't hit overbought yet align: start position: 0% lines still hasn't hit overbought yet align: start position: 0% lines still hasn't hit overbought yet and if all the rules were met you take a align: start position: 0% and if all the rules were met you take a align: start position: 0% and if all the rules were met you take a buy position align: start position: 0% buy position align: start position: 0% buy position let's move on to finding cell signals align: start position: 0% let's move on to finding cell signals align: start position: 0% let's move on to finding cell signals again align: start position: 0% again align: start position: 0% again the first step is you want to look at align: start position: 0% the first step is you want to look at align: start position: 0% the first step is you want to look at the stochastic align: start position: 0% the stochastic align: start position: 0% the stochastic and wait for both the k and d lines to align: start position: 0% and wait for both the k and d lines to align: start position: 0% and wait for both the k and d lines to hit overbought align: start position: 0% hit overbought align: start position: 0% hit overbought then you want to use the rsi to confirm align: start position: 0% then you want to use the rsi to confirm align: start position: 0% then you want to use the rsi to confirm the downtrend align: start position: 0% the downtrend align: start position: 0% the downtrend by making sure that it's below the align: start position: 0% by making sure that it's below the align: start position: 0% by making sure that it's below the middle line align: start position: 0% middle line align: start position: 0% middle line the next step is you want to use the align: start position: 0% the next step is you want to use the align: start position: 0% the next step is you want to use the macd to confirm the downwards momentum align: start position: 0% macd to confirm the downwards momentum align: start position: 0% macd to confirm the downwards momentum by waiting for the macd line to cross align: start position: 0% by waiting for the macd line to cross align: start position: 0% by waiting for the macd line to cross below the signal line align: start position: 0% below the signal line align: start position: 0% below the signal line and you still need to make sure that align: start position: 0% and you still need to make sure that align: start position: 0% and you still need to make sure that both of the knd line still has it hit align: start position: 0% both of the knd line still has it hit align: start position: 0% both of the knd line still has it hit oversold align: start position: 0% oversold align: start position: 0% oversold once all the rules are met you take a align: start position: 0% once all the rules are met you take a align: start position: 0% once all the rules are met you take a sell position align: start position: 0% sell position align: start position: 0% sell position [Music] align: start position:

k and d align: start position: 0% we can see that both of the k and d lines is at overbought align: start position: 0% lines is at overbought align: start position: 0% lines is at overbought meaning we're going to take a cell align: start position: 0% meaning we're going to take a cell align: start position: 0% meaning we're going to take a cell position then align: start position: 0% position then align: start position: 0% position then you want to confirm the downtrend by align: start position: 0% you want to confirm the downtrend by align: start position: 0% you want to confirm the downtrend by making sure that the rsi align: start position: 0% making sure that the rsi align: start position: 0% making sure that the rsi is below the middle line the next step align: start position: 0% is below the middle line the next step align: start position: 0% is below the middle line the next step is you want to use the macd to further align: start position: 0% is you want to use the macd to further align: start position: 0% is you want to use the macd to further confirm the downwards momentum align: start position: 0% confirm the downwards momentum align: start position: 0% confirm the downwards momentum by waiting for the macd line to cross align: start position: 0% by waiting for the macd line to cross align: start position: 0% by waiting for the macd line to cross below the signal line align: start position: 0% below the signal line align: start position: 0% below the signal line and make sure that both of the k and d align: start position: 0% and make sure that both of the k and d align: start position: 0% and make sure that both of the k and d lines still hasn't hit oversold align: start position: 0% lines still hasn't hit oversold align: start

start position: 0% so after back testing i discovered a align: start position: 0% so after back testing i discovered a couple of optimization and changes that align: start position: 0% couple of optimization and changes that align: start position: 0% couple of optimization and changes that you can implement align: start position: 0% you can implement align: start position: 0% you can implement to further increase the win rate for the align: start position: 0% to further increase the win rate for the align: start position: 0% to further increase the win rate for the strategy align:
