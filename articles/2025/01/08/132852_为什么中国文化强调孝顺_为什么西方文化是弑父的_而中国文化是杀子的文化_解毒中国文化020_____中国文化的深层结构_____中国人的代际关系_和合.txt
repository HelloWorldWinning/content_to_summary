**II. Cultural Differences:**
    *   **A. China:**
        *   Culture of "killing children," meaning the suppression of new vitality to uphold traditional values.
        *   Hierarchical authority, with the old often manipulating the young for their own benefit (e.g., during the Cultural Revolution).
        *   Emphasis on obedience and conformity rather than talent and individuality.

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en-US Why does Chinese society emphasize filial piety? Why does Western culture kill fathers while Chinese culture kills sons? Today we continue to read the deep structure of Chinese culture. Today’s chapter of this book has the answers to the above questions. The chapter we read today is China. If you want to hear more about the two topics of human intergenerational relations and the culture of child killing, you can subscribe to my YouTube. After reading this book, I will also read more books on the topic of Chinese culture to help myself check and kill. The Chinese cultural virus in the mind will jump to the state of modern civilization as soon as possible. Let's start. The intergenerational relationship of Chinese people. The first reaction of people to authority occurs in the family, because the family is the place where people are born and grow up. In the future, the attitude towards social authority is often a continuous response to family authority. Since Chinese people also engage in paternalistic rule in political life, the superiors must be close to the people like a parent-child relationship, and the subordinates must be kind to the government for their upbringing. Be grateful and give your heart to it. Therefore, the attitude towards authority that Chinese people have developed in their families since childhood has become a key to understanding the political behavior of Chinese people. The intergenerational relationship of Westerners, especially the intergenerational relationship after the industrial revolution, can be expressed in terms of Flo. The concept of the psychological entanglement of father-killing and Oedipus proposed by Ide is summarized. Using this myth to explain the intergenerational relationship of Westerners is of course only metaphorical. It only symbolically illustrates that the intergenerational relationship of Westerners emphasizes the rupture of each generation. After growing up, they have completely established themselves, allowed their own sexuality to fully sprout, completely eliminated the older generation, and completely accepted the position they occupied. In addition, in order to allow their own independent personality to emerge, they must also overcome the previous generation's relationship with them during the growth process. The shaping of one's own character is gradually eradicated in order to allow the self to emerge. This is also the only way to build the self into a strong base for introspection. Therefore, each generation has its own legitimate status of existence, allows its potential to fully bloom, and has its own new generation. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to make each generation an independent unit independent of the previous generation. The price paid for this arrangement is, of course, the tendency of intergenerational discord and the desire of each person to establish his own personality. The measures to form antagonistic personality are Westerners with cultural structural correlations. The relationship between generations is a friendship relationship based on equality of personality. This type of fractured intergenerational relationship is not the unilateral request of the next generation to the children of the previous generation. The way of education also paves the way for this future break. It is different from the habit of Chinese parents to let their underage children sleep with them. Westerners train their children to sleep alone from an early age so that they do not need to be with others often in order to cultivate independence. In addition, the spirit of the past is different from the Chinese approach of treating adults as children. Westerners often treat children with the same attitude towards adults in order to create an attitude of equality of personality. These measures are a pair of parents in an American family who are preparing to break with the next generation. Tell me that we do not treat our children as our own private property. They are just entrusted to us by God on earth. Therefore, their entire way of raising children is designed to make the next generation independent and complete individuals. If you are not willing to let your children be for the sake of feelings, Leaving oneself and causing them to be overly dependent on themselves is equivalent to harming children in societies like the West, especially the United States. Obviously, the entire Protestant culture appeals to the function of the left half of the cerebral cortex, so it emphasizes the individual's dependence on himself. Rationally organizing their upbringing from generation to generation is also to cultivate such people. For this purpose, the factor of human feelings must be relatively weakened. The result will naturally be the incompatibility between generations and the low level of human feelings in the entire society. Intergenerational relations in society are always tense because the growth of the next generation will always pose a threat to the established authority status of the previous generation. However, the East and the West have proposed different ways to solve this problem. Westerners allow each generation to To be able to fully establish oneself, the previous generation must be pushed aside, and the intergenerational relationship must be broken. Neither the upper nor the next generation will have any objection to this arrangement, because everyone has the opportunity to take turns being the previous generation and the next generation. Since each generation wants to To establish one's own independent personality, it is necessary to gradually eliminate the influence of the previous generation on oneself, and one does not want to overly impose one's will on the next generation. As for the Chinese answer to intergenerational relations, the next generation is required to completely surrender to the previous generation and They believe that only when they fully agree can it be called filial piety, so they define filial piety and unfilial piety in terms of xiao and unxiao, and xiao means similar meanings. Of course, the more they push the ancients, the more they evolve into a mentality of worshiping the ancients. This is of course the tendency of harmony in Chinese culture. This is because the emphasis on harmony is not allowed to cause any rupture. In addition, the Chinese are individuals who practice benevolence. Basically, there is no legitimacy. It must be restricted by external forces in order to define it. Therefore, whether it is the previous generation or the next generation, They all have to erase themselves and assume the attitude of focusing on the other person who defines themselves. As a result, every generation of the Chinese people is not a flower in full bloom. After being erased by the previous generation, each generation goes to re-create the next generation. Obliterate and pass on the individuality that has been flattened by the public from one generation to another. The result is to be consistent with the regime and agree with the ancient times that the more ancient the better. This arrangement is the best way to ensure that Chinese history will last forever. It is also impossible for each generation to show magnificent new things, new realms, and new worlds like in the West. As a result, each generation of the Chinese people is not a blooming flower. After being obliterated by the previous generation, each generation will obliterate the next generation and will continue to do so. The personality that has been flattened by the public is passed down from generation to generation, and the result is that everyone is consistent with the regime and agrees with the ancient times that the more reforms are better, this arrangement is the best way to ensure that Chinese history will last forever, and it will never be possible. Like the West, each generation presents magnificent new things, new realms, new worlds, and a culture of killing children. If Western culture can be regarded as a culture of killing fathers, then Chinese culture might as well be called a culture of killing children. A culture of killing fathers cannot be regarded as a death cult. Because even things that are about to wither in nature must make way for new things to ensure the continuation of nature's vitality. As for the culture of killing children, it is an out-and-out death worship because it destroys new vitality to nourish the dying. The dead tree Lu Xun pointed out during the May Fourth Movement that the Chinese people are more whimsical from old age to death, occupying the paths of young people and sucking out the air of young people. The May Fourth Enlightenment Movement and the subsequent Communist Movement can become a way to attract young people. It is not surprising that a generation of elites are the focus. However, as the first generation of leaders of the Communist Party gradually entered their old age, they seemed to repeat the same mistakes. Indeed, the May Fourth Movement was an era that was aroused by external ideological trends, so it was also a revolutionary era. However, in The contrast in intergenerational relations that emerged in this era seems to be a one-and-done phenomenon. It cannot be institutionalized in culture unless a major operation is performed on the deep structure of culture. Many such phenomena have already appeared in the political activities of the Republic of China. The cunning old man hides behind the scenes and manipulates the hot-blooded young people to charge into battle and kill heads as tools for profit in the fire. These old zombies use the blood of young people to hunt for the blood of high-ranking officials and Houlu who fought with each other between different factions during the Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards soon also became a tool for power struggles between different factions of the bureaucracy and the military. They used the blood of teenagers to ensure their authority or even dye their hair red. Therefore, the grammatical rules of cultural behavior are basically the same. It is said that the original code level at the bottom is the same. As for today, it is even more obvious to use obedience instead of talent or personality as the criterion for promoting underachievers. In a system with political leaders and various factions, this tendency is not only inevitable. Moreover, these situations that have been institutionalized reflect the political relations between generations. In the daily lives of ordinary people, intergenerational relations are certainly not so bloody. In China, there are still many cases of parents obstructing the free marriage of their children, and sometimes they are punished by law. Support, but according to some people, in terms of life, it depends on whether the previous generation or the next generation is worse. The social arrangement of relying on parents and friends at home will ensure that young people will never be able to stand on their own, and each generation will not blossom and bear fruit in China. The previous generation only hoped that their children would earn money to supplement the family income earlier rather than follow their own chosen path to develop as individuals. In Chinese culture, individuals tend to be treated as tools rather than ends.
