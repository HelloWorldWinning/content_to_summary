Description:
好的，这是对所提供内容的总结：

**1. 核心要点 (Core Point)：**

AdamW 优于 Adam-`2 的优势可能源于其“尺度无关性”更新，使其在梯度尺度差异较大的情况下表现更好。

**2. 根本要点 (Fundamental Point)：**

AdamW 可以被解释为一种近端梯度方法的近似，该方法利用正则化项的闭式近端映射，而非仅仅使用梯度信息，同时还具备“尺度无关性”的优势。

**3. 总体框架 (Overarching Framework)：**

本文从优化和实证两个角度分析了 AdamW 的优势：
    *   理论上，将 AdamW 解释为近端梯度法的近似。
    *   实证上，研究了 AdamW 的“尺度无关性”及其在深度网络训练中的优势。
    *   提出了 AdamW 在梯度尺度差异较大的问题中性能更优的假设。
    *   讨论了该研究的局限性，并指出了未来研究方向。

Content:
Adam has been widely adopted for training deep neural networks due to less hyperparameter tuning and
remarkable performance. To improve generalization, Adam is typically used in tandem with a squared `2
regularizer (referred to as Adam-`2). However, even better performance can be obtained with AdamW, which
decouples the gradient of the regularizer from the update rule of Adam-`2. Yet, we are still lacking a complete
explanation of the advantages of AdamW. In this paper, we tackle this question from both an optimization
and an empirical point of view. First, we show how to re-interpret AdamW as an approximation of a proximal
gradient method, which takes advantage of the closed-form proximal mapping of the regularizer instead of
only utilizing its gradient information as in Adam-`2. Next, we consider the property of “scale-freeness”
enjoyed by AdamW and by its proximal counterpart: their updates are invariant to component-wise rescaling
of the gradients. We provide empirical evidence across a wide range of deep learning experiments showing
a correlation between the problems in which AdamW exhibits an advantage over Adam-`2 and the degree to
which we expect the gradients of the network to exhibit multiple scales, thus motivating the hypothesis that
the advantage of AdamW could be due to the scale-free updates.

5 Conclusion and Future Works
In this paper, we provide insights for understanding the merits of AdamW from two points of view. We
first show that AdamW is an approximation of the proximal updates both theoretically and empirically. We
then identify the setting of training very deep neural networks without batch normalization in which AdamW
substantially outperforms Adam-`2 in both training and testing and show its correlation with the scale-freeness
property of AdamW. Nevertheless, we are aware of some limitations of this work as well as many directions
worth exploring.
Limitations First, we only focus on investigating the effects of scale-freeness on Adam-`2 and AdamW, but it
would be interesting to study scale-freeness more generally. Also, what we showed is just a correlation instead
of causality thus we did not rule out other possible causes beyond scale-freeness for the success of AdamW.
Indeed, rigorously proving causality for any such claim is extremely difficult - even in the hard sciences. Note
that there are papers claiming that adaptive updates have worse generalization (Wilson et al., 2017); however,
such claims have been recently partly confuted (see, e.g., Agarwal et al., 2020). On this note, despite its
empirical success, we stress that Adam will not even converge on some convex functions (Reddi et al., 2018),
thus making it hard to prove formal theoretical convergence and/or generalization guarantees.
