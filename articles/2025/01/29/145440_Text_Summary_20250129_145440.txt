Description:
**Summary:**

1. **Optimizer Function:**
    * Optimizers adjust neural network weights and learning rates.
    * Goal: To minimize losses.

2. **Adam Optimizer:**
    *  Advantage: Parameter updates are invariant to gradient scale changes.
    *  Disadvantage: Sometimes other optimizers generalize better.

3. **AdamW Optimizer:**
    * A variation of Adam.
    * Weight decay applied after step size control.
   
4. **Comparative Study:**
    * Task: Temperature forecast in Quito using neural network with uncertainty reduction.
    * Optimizers Compared: Adam, AdaMax, and AdamW.
   * Evaluation: Three error metrics were calculated per hour.
    
5. **Results:**
    * Adam and AdaMax performed similarly, with a max hourly MSE of 2.5°C.
    * AdamW reduced the error to approximately 1.3°C.

**Core Point:** AdamW demonstrated superior performance in temperature forecasting by achieving a lower mean squared error compared to Adam and AdaMax.

**Fundamental Point:** Optimizers play a crucial role in neural network training, and the choice of optimizer can significantly affect a model's performance.

**Overarching Framework:** The content provides a comparison of optimizers within a practical scenario of temperature forecasting, highlighting the effect of the optimizer choices.

Content:
The main function of an optimizer is to determine in what measure to change the weights and the learning rate of the neural network to reduce losses. One of the best known optimizers is Adam, which main advantage is the invariance of the magnitudes of the parameter updates with respect to the change of scale of the gradient. However, other optimizers are often chosen because they generalize in a better manner. AdamW is a variant of Adam where the weight decay is performed only after controlling the parameter-wise step size. In order to present a comparative scenario for optimizers in the present work, a Temperature Forecast for the Andean city of Quito using a neural network structure with uncertainty reduction was implemented and three optimizers (Adam, AdaMax and AdamW) were analyzed. In order to do the comparison three error metrics were obtained per hour in order to determine the effectiveness of the prediction. From the analysis it can be seen that Adam and AdaMax behave similarly reaching a maximum MSE per hour of 2.5°C nevertheless AdamW allows to reduce this error around 1.3°C.
