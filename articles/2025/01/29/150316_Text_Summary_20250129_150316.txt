Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Core Ideas**

*   **Adam and Regularization:** Adam is a popular optimizer for deep learning, often used with L2 regularization (Adam-λ2).
*   **AdamW Improvement:** AdamW improves upon Adam-λ2 by decoupling the gradient of the regularizer from the Adam update.
*   **Proximal Interpretation:** AdamW can be interpreted as an approximation of a proximal gradient method, leveraging the closed-form proximal mapping of the regularizer.
*   **Scale-Freeness:** AdamW, like its proximal counterpart, exhibits "scale-freeness," meaning its updates are invariant to component-wise gradient rescaling.
*   **Empirical Correlation:** The advantage of AdamW over Adam-λ2 correlates with the degree to which gradients in the network exhibit multiple scales.

**II. Conclusion**

*   **Core Point:** AdamW's improved performance likely stems from its scale-free updates, which is better suited for networks with multi-scaled gradients.
*   **Fundamental Point:** AdamW's proximal method approximation and scale-free update property offer a distinct advantage over Adam-λ2, especially in scenarios with complex gradients.

**III. Overarching Framework**

The content presents an analysis of AdamW's advantages over Adam-λ2. It investigates this by:
    1.  Proposing a theoretical re-interpretation of AdamW as a proximal method.
    2.  Identifying scale-freeness as a key property.
    3.  Providing empirical evidence correlating scale-freeness with performance gains in deep learning scenarios.

Content:
Adam has been widely adopted for training deep neural networks due to less hyperparameter tuning and
remarkable performance. To improve generalization, Adam is typically used in tandem with a squared `2
regularizer (referred to as Adam-`2). However, even better performance can be obtained with AdamW, which
decouples the gradient of the regularizer from the update rule of Adam-`2. Yet, we are still lacking a complete
explanation of the advantages of AdamW. In this paper, we tackle this question from both an optimization
and an empirical point of view. First, we show how to re-interpret AdamW as an approximation of a proximal
gradient method, which takes advantage of the closed-form proximal mapping of the regularizer instead of
only utilizing its gradient information as in Adam-`2. Next, we consider the property of “scale-freeness”
enjoyed by AdamW and by its proximal counterpart: their updates are invariant to component-wise rescaling
of the gradients. We provide empirical evidence across a wide range of deep learning experiments showing
a correlation between the problems in which AdamW exhibits an advantage over Adam-`2 and the degree to
which we expect the gradients of the network to exhibit multiple scales, thus motivating the hypothesis that
the advantage of AdamW could be due to the scale-free updates.

5 Conclusion and Future Works
In this paper, we provide insights for understanding the merits of AdamW from two points of view. We
first show that AdamW is an approximation of the proximal updates both theoretically and empirically. We
then identify the setting of training very deep neural networks without batch normalization in which AdamW
substantially outperforms Adam-`2 in both training and testing and show its correlation with the scale-freeness
property of AdamW. Nevertheless, we are aware of some limitations of this work as well as many directions
worth exploring.
Limitations First, we only focus on investigating the effects of scale-freeness on Adam-`2 and AdamW, but it
would be interesting to study scale-freeness more generally. Also, what we showed is just a correlation instead
of causality thus we did not rule out other possible causes beyond scale-freeness for the success of AdamW.
Indeed, rigorously proving causality for any such claim is extremely difficult - even in the hard sciences. Note
that there are papers claiming that adaptive updates have worse generalization (Wilson et al., 2017); however,
such claims have been recently partly confuted (see, e.g., Agarwal et al., 2020). On this note, despite its
empirical success, we stress that Adam will not even converge on some convex functions (Reddi et al., 2018),
thus making it hard to prove formal theoretical convergence and/or generalization guarantees.
