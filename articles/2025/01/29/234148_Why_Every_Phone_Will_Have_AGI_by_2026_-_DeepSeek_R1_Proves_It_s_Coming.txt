Description:
**Summary Outline:**

I.  **The AI Paradigm Shift:**
    *   Recent release of high-performing, open-source Chinese AI models (e.g., DeepSeek R1, Quinn 2.5 VL) has shocked the tech world.
    *   This led to a significant Nvidia stock decline, signaling a potential shift in the demand for high-end AI chips.
    *   AI cost is decreasing while its power increases, leading to a rapid adoption tipping point.
    *   This is driven by improved models that are smaller, faster, and more efficient.
    *   The market is now signaling that the business case for this technology is becoming unignorable.

II.  **China's Strategy and AI Efficiency:**
    *   Trade embargos on Chinese chip access have spurred innovative AI development.
    *   They doubled down on distillation, self-play, reinforcement learning, and quantization.
    *   This highlights that constraints can lead to creativity.
    *   The efficiency of AI models is still far from its theoretical limits.

III. **Terminal Race Condition:**
    *   Nations and corporations are incentivized to invest heavily in AI.
    *   There is no clear moat, meaning everyone can improve at similar rates based on investment and innovation.
    *   The optimal strategy for all actors is maximum AI investment, leading to a Nash equilibrium.
    *   This is driven by an attractor state towards having AI and superintelligence as soon as possible.

IV. **Cognitive Saturation and Local Development:**
    *   We are heading towards a cognitive saturation point where any cognitive labor can be done instantly by AI.
    *   AI models are reaching a cognitive threshold to become universal and ubiquitous.
    *   Local AI model development is now possible, making AI accessible to everyone.
    *  While computing power asymmetry will persist, there is a limit to the utility of additional superintelligence.

V. **Intelligence Utility Plateau:**
    *   There are mathematical limits to maximum intelligence.
    *   Practical limits exist in useful intelligence, as tasks have defined cognitive levels.
    *   Eventually, AI will reach a point where it can do everything that the smartest human can and even surpass it, but this does not necessarily translate to infinitely increasing performance.
    *   The focus will shift to speed and efficiency rather than just increased raw intelligence.

VI. **Infinite Data Flywheel:**
    *   Reasoning models can synthesize functionally infinite amounts of high-quality data.
    *   This data can train new models, resulting in smaller, faster, and smarter AI through a virtuous cycle.
    *   Data and algorithms are no longer moats, with infrastructure being the only significant moat.
    *   China has shown that even infrastructure is not a perfect moat.
    *   The focus should be on onshore infrastructure (data centers, semiconductors, power generation, internet).

VII.  **Challenges and Complex Systems:**
    *  The proliferation of AI models leads to a Byzantine generals problem due to unknown alignment and model quality.
    *  Alignment cannot be solved at the model level but must be solved at the network or system level.
    *   Incentives should be at the system level, and good behavior must be incentivized via technologies like blockchain and reputation management.
    *   The AI landscape will be a complex, adaptive system with various actors, similar to stock markets.

VIII. **Obsolescence of Corporations:**
    *   The purpose of corporations as organizers of labor and capital will diminish as AI and robotics automate most tasks.
    *   Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) may replace corporations as a more efficient way to organize assets.
    *   The era of big tech corporations might be coming to an end as AI democratizes technology access.
    *   Market efficiency and creative destruction will diffuse wealth and access to AI technology.

**Core Point:**
The advent of high-performing, open-source AI models is rapidly democratizing access to advanced technology, challenging existing power structures, and fundamentally altering economic paradigms.

**Fundamental Point:**
The convergence of decreasing AI costs, increasing AI capabilities, and the development of local AI models is driving a profound shift that will reshape society and economy.

**Overarching Framework:**
The content is structured around a multi-faceted analysis of the recent developments in AI, emphasizing its accelerating pace of innovation, the strategic implications for nations and corporations, the resulting economic restructuring and the shift toward ubiquitous AI and its potential impact on future organization of capital, labor and social norms.

many of you have been asking me about what the implications are of deep seek and a few other of the Chinese models that have been released that are completely and purely open source but not only are they open source they are performant uh pretty close to the closed Source models but they're also a fraction of the cost now there's a lot of ramifications that we can uh extract from this so let's get into it first and foremost if you didn't hear uh after news of this happened on the 27th uh the Nvidia stock market route was uh characterized by 177% decline the largest decline of uh in terms of uh valuation loss by any single company in any single day uh the Nvidia stock lost $600 billion of market cap in one go so that was the Catalyst was primarily deep seeks R1 um it has since rebounded just a little bit and a lot of people are confused they're like Nvidia sells the chips that it runs on but I guess the investors were a little bit spooked because they thought hey uh well if it's not going to take as many chips as we thought maybe Nvidia isn't as valuable as we thought it was going to be that's about it um now people have been talking about javon's Paradox which I've mentioned as well on a few videos which basically as and it's not just javan's Paradox by the way because there's actually two things that are happening so one the cost of AI is coming down but also the power of AI is increasing and so there's this there's this uh inflection point point I can't remember the exact economic term but it's like a preference Cascade inflection point I know I just kind of made that up where basically oh something's getting cheaper but it's also getting better and so then you get to that Tipping Point and then everyone wants it all at once um it's kind of like cars you know once cars were cheap enough and ubiquitous enough it's like oh well that just makes sense same thing with when we saw the the switch to uh smartphones where it's like well you know first generation smartphones weren't the most useful thing but eventually the utility of something gets so high particularly once we got to 4G um you know oh well smartphones are fast enough now they're powerful enough now they can do enough it's just it just makes more sense to use a smartphone than a dumb phone um and we got to that Tipping Point around what 2015 I think is when we kind of really saw that that transition that adoption accelerate so when some when the cost of something drops that quickly and then at the same time the utility is also increasing we're getting agents we're getting operators we're getting reasoning models so we're going to start to see that Tipping Point where it's like okay the business case for this technology is becoming unignorable and that's going to happen this year that's actually what the market kind of was signaling is investors said this actually changes the game and this was the first time I mean we saw Gary Marcus and and others talking to all the major news networks and it's unfortunate that it was Gary Marcus but at least we're getting attention now so these Chinese models which two of the top ones were deep seek R1 and Quinn 2. 5 VL there is a handful of others All released this week um but basically this as I've talked to people the hypothesis is and and some people predicted this by the way but the hypothesis is that by strangling uh the Chinese chip Market with uh embargos with trade embargos basically they said okay well we're going to use what we've got and we're going to double down on what works and so what they doubled down on was things like distillation and selfplay and reinforcement learning um and quantization also hang on my dogs need to get out okay sorry about that uh but yeah so the Chinese just doubled down on what worked with what they had uh we have seen this historically the Soviet Union had to do the same thing during the Cold War which is they didn't have the uh quite the engineering resources that we had in America but they were still able to stay neck and neck mostly just due to the law of constraints which was well not the law not the law of constraints but my my side law of constraints which is that uh necessity is the mother of invention but uh constraints are the father of creativity um and the Chinese have demonstrated that I mean you know you've got a nation of some of the best mathematicians in the world and they say well we don't have the data center capacity but we have the math uh let's do the math so that's really basically all there is to it there's been some conspiracy theories and other stuff about you know like maybe it's a scop or this that or the other but really like if you talk to the scientists it's like we're nowhere near the the lower bound of the energetic efficiency for these AI models so when you see something you know Leap Forward by an order of magnitude or several orders of magnitude we have seen this actually repeatedly over the last 3 or four years gpt2 was a much smaller model but it was you know not particularly smart gpt3 was a thousand times better uh literally a thousand times better and we measured the tokens of gpt3 by by the batch of a thousand tokens and now you measure them by a million tokens so when when just based on first principles here's what I'm trying to say based on first principles you can calculate okay what is the minimum cost to generate a a token we're nowhere near what that what that lower bound is this is what Sam Alman was talking about when he said towards intelligence too cheap to meter now of course he was uh you know being a little bit hubristic with that and China just came and said oh yeah we're going to do that um so this is this has been a Clarion call to the west and open Ai and Silicon Valley and everyone else to say get your act in gear so moving on this uh basically uh revitalizes uh a hypothesis that I had last year and in 2023 which I called the terminal race condition so terminal race condition basically says that the most rational behavior for Nations and corporations is to invest in Ai and that is because the first one to the prize uh basically wins now there's no moat so as I've talked about recently the fact that there's no moat means that everyone can get there at the same Pace it's just a matter of investment and it's a matter of how clever you are now the what I mean by terminal race condition is that uh well I mean you can just read it right here uh this Dynamic resembles an ash equilibrium where no player can improve their position unilaterally by deviating from the all-in AI strategy um so the Nash equilibrium is the optimal strategy for All actors is maximum AI investment that's what we're seeing here in America with uh the Trump Administration with Elon with everyone else going on so the the Nash equilibrium is you must invest in AI if you want to stay relevant as a company as a nation invest in Ai and that means uh not just positive investment but also deregulation next is the attractor state so the an attractor state is basically the the uh the gravitational pull of the current system the gravitational pull of the current system says we're going to have AGI and Asi as soon as possible and we're only accelerating so that's the attractor state so not not only are going to have uh powerful systems they're going to be ubiquitous and the reason that they're going to be ubiquitous is because well we're finding that you can make them smaller and smarter um and what by smaller I mean faster more energy efficient um and and less resource intensive so all of those kind of form a virtuous cycle there and as I've mentioned it is a multi-level race so the competition is is occurring between nations such as the USA and China primarily as well as corporations such as Microsoft Google meta and so on another way to think about this is the Red Queen Dynamic so red queen theory is basically you have to keep evolving as fast as you can just to maintain the current status quo just to maintain the current relative positioning um you cannot rest on your laurels here and the fact that you cannot rest on your laurels which is what Sam Alman and open AI were doing they're like we're so amazing you know we did 01 and we're doing 03 and we don't really have anything to worry about because we're miles ahead of the competitors well then the Chinese companies come came and said yeah a about that get wrecked um so when when you can't rest on your laurels and everyone has to invest and everyone has to move as fast as they can this creates a race Dynamic and that's why I call it terminal race condition because the end of this race is the singularity that's what I mean by terminal race condition this ends with human Humanity transcending or nuking ourselves out of existence if you followed me for any length of time there was a period of time that I was worried more about the negative outcomes I'm not really worried about those anymore and I don't really spend that much time unpacking them some people are still worried but in my audience the polls show that most of you are not worried so I'm just going to move on all right so what is this mean one of the first orders uh one of the first order impacts is that we're heading towards a cognitive saturation point which basically means any cognitive labor that needs to get done will get done and it not only will it get done it'll get done almost instantly so uh one one way to think about this is first is the cognitive threshold so a cognitive threshold is basically once you have models that are smart enough to do most things and you can copy billions of them they're going to be everywhere and not only that they're going to get lighter they're going to get faster cheaper you know all that fun stuff over time better faster cheaper safer over time which means less hallucination and you know better guard rails and yada y y um but that cognitive threshold is basically once you're smart enough to do something you can do everything in that category of difficulty once you're smart enough to get to the next level the next DC the next difficulty class that's for a tabletop RPG players so there's you're if you're int you know like there's certain problems that if your int is 10 you can't do that if your int is 15 you can do that if your int is 20 you can solve every every int throw out there so the for the D andd players and the other tabletop R RPG players you get it so right now the int of these models is at like 12 to 13 maybe 14 and so it's like okay you know you can solve a lot of problems but in a year or two they're going to be at int8 18 19 and 20 which means there's no difficulty class of any task above what our models can do um next is local development so this uh we I'll mention this a couple times in the video but but you know just a quick anecdote is two years ago 2023 I consulted for um briefly for the investment arm of Qualcomm just a couple of of uh of their of their investment guys and one of the things that they told me that has turned out to be true is they anticipated that AI would be commoditized IED basically AI models are going to get better faster smarter cheaper more efficient so on and so forth until they're going to be running on pretty much any hardware including mobile Hardware that is coming true this year so the guys at Qualcomm knew this two years ago thanks for telling me um that means we're going to be running a AGI locally within a couple years that means we're going to be running super intelligent locally within a few years um that means that it is universal access that means that this technology is intr ially going to be democratized which means that everyone's going to have access to it now with that being said there's always going to be an advantage to having more compute Firepower if you have some of those gigantic Nvidia chips that means it's not that you're just running one local AGI you can run billions of agis so there will always be a power asymmetry people who own the data centers and the servers are going to be able to run more of these things in parallel um and probably run them a little bit faster than you can on your you know laptop or cell phone or whatever that's perfectly fine but the point here though is that it will be for everyone it will be ubiquitous um but again eventually you're going to find it where it's like okay there's diminishing marginal utility to having even more agis maybe the optimal number of Super intelligences in the world is like I don't know 100, 000 or 100 million or something like that and beyond that they're just going to be sitting there twiddling their thumbs because every problem is going to be solved like that's what we that's what I mean by cognitive saturation Point that's what I mean by cognitive hyper abundance all right all right moving on so another thing to consider in this terminal raise condition is what I call I've I've called this thing several different things it's like an intelligence Optimum but the term that I'm using right now is an intelligence utility Plateau so basically there are probably mathematical limits to maximum intelligence um and there are certainly limits to useful intelligence so and basically there's always a level of uncertainty or or irreducible complexity in the universe which means from a mathematical perspective there are limits to what you can solve just through thought um eventually you know as as they said as they said in Oppenheimer Theory will only get get you so far so we we will we will expand to the sphere of which theory is the limit but then you have to run real world experiments so there are mathematical theoretical limit limits to the upper bound of what is the maximum possible intelligence Beyond which it's like okay well you actually are going to be better um better uh served by optimizing for Speed and efficiency because if you have you know something with an IQ of a billion but it takes a thousand years to render a solution that's not particularly useful if you have something with an IQ of 160 and it can render you know a thousand decisions a second that's still going to get you further faster because then you have the the the feedback loop the positive feedback loop of intelligence now also there is a practical Plateau um there are going to be so so going back to that difficulty class idea um every specific task requires only a certain level of intelligence um I remember there was someone saying like Oh I'm a chat GPT power user I'm like if you're not finding an edge case where the where the model can't serve you you're not a power user because you're not taking the model to the edge of what it can do so there are plenty of people out there that think that they're you know super smart you know they're like oh I'm I'm you know Mr power user over here it's like yeah but a high school level model is serving everything that you think you need so therefore you're operating at like a high school level sorry buddy and I by the way when 01 started getting rolled out I had some people messaging me they're like 01 is able to do everything that I can do now and so you have this this kind of gradation this graduation of okay this model is operating at an IQ of like roughly 120 another at 130 140 once the model is smarter than you it can do everything that you want it to do and as the models continue getting smarter eventually there's going to be the smartest person on the planet for whom the model does everything that they need it to do and at which point the models have transcended all human cognitive capability uh that is the intelligence utility Plateau which is basically there's no problems that that we can't ask it to solve that it won't solve but there's also probably uh it probably follows a sigmoid curve or an exponential decay where it's like okay you know the the the sphere of things that are outside of the model's capability are infinitely smaller all right you get the idea moving on uh real quick plug for all of my links and everything I want to call your attention to two particular things so number one is my patreon so it's a $5 Community with an exclusive Discord um we're always hanging out there we love talking about all kinds of stuff I have channels dedicated to all the aliens and UFOs and stuff going on um post labor economics which is what we're talking about here AI of course um neuros spicy channels LGBT uh channels all kinds of fun stuff um it's a very well moderated Community everyone gets along really well and the other thing is my learning community which is New Era Pathfinders which I've been working really hard on revamping and adding new courses right now I've got three courses started so one is about AI so just learning prompt engineering using the project features um another one is learning about psychedelics and everything that I've learned about psychedelics uh and then the the third course is unfor your life which is a new series that I just started which is everything I have learned the hard way of what not to do in life so now I'm getting my diet sleep exercise is everything in order cuz as I mentioned I've been through really serious burnout so I've learned things the hard way and I'm here to teach you okay moving on back to the show now one of the one of the first order consequences of uh everything that we've seen in the last week with uh China and deep seek and all that stuff is we will have AGI at the edge um the price is going to come down and all these things are going to be running on local models uh and local hardware this means that it will be Universal it'll be running at the edge and most importantly is that it will uh result in infrastructure bypass which means right now you can only use these models if they're running on a data center somewhere uh the best models you can if they're running in a data center somewhere and you access them via API so now we have people running you know deep seek R1 uh locally on you know an Nvidia 3090 or 4090 or whatever and this will also accelerate adoption so an acceleration of adoption will also create compounding returns so this is another example where it's not just the science that's advancing now the commercial adoption will also advance and accelerate now the most exciting part and I just came up with this idea yesterday well sort of um I was talking about this idea yesterday with some really sharp people and that is the infinite data flywheel now as we compress all human knowledge into these models and their reasoning model models that can reason from first principles you're going to get that recursive self-improvement Loop starting now it's not going to be direct it's not going to be like one model just builds the next model you know with one step there's a few steps in between there but with reasoning models you can synthesize functionally infinite amounts of highquality data and then you can use that data to train the next generation of models which is even smaller and faster and smarter and more efficient which you can then use to refine the data set and expand the data set even more and so you have this this uh virtuous cycle this compounding returns of data which means data is not emote so the algorithms were not emote the data is not emote anymore especially because of these open source models deep seek they don't care if you use their model to generate data what is what does open AI have in their terms of service don't use our models to generate data to try and train a better version of our model um okay yeah let's see how that worked out for you um so there data is not emote algorithms are not emote the only remote is in infrastructure which is this slide in the world of AGI and and super intelligence infrastructure is the only Moe um now the Chinese even demonstrated that that's not even a great Moe because as long as you can get your hands on any gpus you can do this research so data centers semiconductors power generation and internet infrastructure those are the four categories of infrastructure so it's data centers chip Fabs uh and the electricity to power it as well as the internet itself to interconnect these things that's the INF structure that you need that's it and then you have AGI you have super intelligence and by the way these models are getting smart enough that you don't even need expert researchers someone was telling me that meta was kind of having an internal panic because their top 10 researchers were all being paid more annually than it cost to train deep seek car1 they're like what are we paying you for so that's a rumor I don't know if that's actually true but it's kind of funny and I want to believe it so that's my head Cannon um so energy dominance and when you look at when you look across the political landscape and you see uh Donald Trump saying you know we're going to crack down on with tariffs and and it's going to be made in America this is why is because onshoring infrastructure um is National Security and this is one thing that I'm very much in favor of is the more data centers we have uh onshore the more semiconductors we have onshore the more solar nuclear power whatever power generation I don't care what kind it is the more we have that on Shore the better off will be because by the way AGI and Asi will help us solve everything else from aging to nuclear fusion to space travel if it's possible I it remains to be seen if warp drive is possible uh if the UFOs are to be believed then physics braking engines are possible we just have no idea how to make them um but yeah so that's really what it comes down to is there is no moat um now I've talked a little or I've alluded to some of the game theory stuff but imagine a world if you will briefly where everyone has super intelligence running in their pocket and you know you have a dozen agents just running on your person at any given time you know you're your laptop your cell phone your your your desktop every device in your house your car we're going to have AGI everywhere so then you say okay well you know not only that there's going to be a proliferation of models because some of them are going to be made in China some in America some by Google meta Microsoft whatever so we're going to have agis all over the place with unknown alignment we're going to have agis all over the place with unknown faults and blind spots and that sort of thing so this leads to What's called the Byzantine generals problem the Byzantine generals problem tldr basically says that um how do you make decisions when you can't trust the other entities or agents that you're trying to make decisions with this is a really big thing because you don't know what operating system they're running you don't know what Hardware they're running and you don't know what the model was trained on or what the what or what the models Mission even is so this is something that I've talked about quite extensively but there are system level and network level ways of dealing with this now this is where we say alignment cannot be solved at the model level this is one of the things that I've been trying to say for a long time but a lot of the purists I'll say they're saying well we need to solve alignment at the model level you were never going to uh uh solve alignment at the model level you have to sign solve it sorry you have to solve alignment at the network level at the system level and so then you have to create a Nash equilibrium where basically if you behave in misaligned ways you get punished you get resources revoked you get firewalls put around you that sort of thing so then you incentivize good behavior by monitoring people's behavior on the networks and this is where Technologies like blockchain and reputation management become absolutely critical uh and plenty of the of the crypto and blockchain folks out there have been working really hard on solving reputation management because if you as an actor have a really Stellar reputation for I have never done any hacking I I don't have any any you know marks on my record then you are more trustworthy but if you start deploying a AGI agents that are trying to hack Banks or you know steal private data then you get some black marks on your record um so that's an example of Nash equilibrium where it's you just incentivize the behavior that you want to see at the network or system level not at the individual level then Oracle verifications Cil resistance and those sorts of things all of this comes down to it boils down to you have to think about this as a complex adaptive system where you've got bunch of individual actors you've got State actors you've got corporate actors and they're all reacting to each other a good way to understand this is look at the GameStop thing with the stock market so youve got the SEC you've got GameStop you've got institutional investors you've got activist investors um that is an example of a complex adaptive system in an antagonistic or hostile environment that's what we're going to be seeing and by the way before anyone panics this is how the internet already works there's always hackers trying to get into every system I worked in it for 20 years like this is just the way the world works now it's just going to be AGI versus AGI instead of human versus human it's all just automation from our perspective finally and this is the most interesting part that I think is the obsolescence of Corporations so ask yourself what is the purpose of a corporation functionally what a corporation does is it organizes labor and capital for the provision of goods and services right now corporations are one of the most efficient ways to organize labor and capital in in such a way to Pro to provision goods and services as cheaply as possible now what about when everything is Agi and robots and it's basically okay well you get rid of the labor component entirely and it's all capital so then a corporation is just a container for Capital assets which is like okay maybe but why not move to something like Dow's decentralized autonomous organizations which are already great ways to organize assets organize ownership because then you know if you remove the human component if you remove the labor component which by the way AGI is about to just nuke the need for human cognitive labor and robots are not far behind nuking the need for human physical labor once and for all so then you have this entirely new set of economic models that are possible um of course the tongue and cheek wave describing it as fully automated luxury space communism this is the automation component AGI is the is the full automation of cognitive labor which by the way people say oh well we'll still need managers and CEOs these models are already smarter than managers and CEOs by the way um so um we will see an inevitable economic restructuring and to put it into into perspective economists have wondered what is the purpose of Corporations for a long time they're like why do corporations exist why are they why are they better at Prov providing goods and services should corporations exist in 10 or 20 years we will probably be having that conversation at a very deep level which is Maybe maybe the era of Corporations is coming to an end and then it's like you might say well then who who owns and runs the data center we can own and run the data center because the robots will manage will build and manage it and then the rest of us just Own It collectively on a on a blockchain that's where I think it's going um now will sole proprietorship and small proprietorship still exist absolutely everyone should have the right to go buy a farm and populate it with robots everyone should have the right to you know make a clothing company or a clothing store um and and and do those sorts of things but the era of big Tech corporations I think will come to an end in 10 to 20 years maybe a little bit more and if this if that sounds outlandish you like oh that's too good to be true remember that a century ago we had the robber barons that were the steel rail and oil tycoons does anyone care about rail tycoons anymore does anyone care about steel tycoons anymore no the technology moved on um and I think the same thing is going to happen to Big Tech and I think that and I think that this wave of artificial intelligence is the first sign of that to come and another way of thinking about this I don't remember where I learned this economic principle but whenever you see a massive concentration of wealth it's because the market has not found the most efficient way of democratizing that good or service yet so when we saw Standard Oil company and uh all the gigantic Rail lines a century ago that was because the market had not yet figured out the best way to efficiently uh distribute those Technologies and those goods and services right now the fact that big Tech is the biggest is all the biggest companies in the world it's like everyone else says I want a piece of that pie and over a couple decades when as everyone is saying I want a piece of that pie I want a piece of Nvidia I want a piece of Microsoft it gets distributed and diffused out into society and as I've pointed out throughout this whole video the incentive for getting that diffusion is very very high on a national level we want that diffusion on a corporate level well the big corporations stand to lose a lot Microsoft Nvidia and so on but other corporations other upstarts they stand to gain a lot um so basically you want this technology distributed as far and wide as possible as fast as possible um you want that for national uh reasons um but then the longterm consequence is what's called creative destruction so the long story short is creative destruction might uh in short destroy big Tech as we know it in the long run that's my hope at least all right thanks for watching cheers have a good one
