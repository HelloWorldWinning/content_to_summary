Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Core Problem:**
    *   Individuals, often daughters, exhibit difficulty forming connections and experience low energy levels due to early experiences with controlling parents, particularly mothers.
    *   This control manifests as boundary violations and a lack of respect for the child's personal space, leading to a feeling of being constantly intruded upon.
    *   This constant pressure can lead to a deeply ingrained habit of retreating from relationships and an inability to cope with intimacy.

2. **Causes of the Problem:**
    *   **Parental Control (Specifically Mothers):** Mothers in East Asian cultures often view crossing their daughter's boundaries as protective, not recognizing it as an infringement. Examples include entering rooms without permission, reading diaries, and monitoring belongings.
    *   **Lack of Independence:** Mothers often fail to see daughters as independent individuals, trying to control their thoughts and actions, leading to conflict when daughters attempt to deviate from their expectations. This control often includes criticism and even physical reprimands.
    *   **Emotional Dependency:** Daughters naturally love their mothers, making it difficult to reject their actions, thus perpetuating the cycle. Mothers may also seek emotional fulfillment through their daughters, deepening this intrusion and making the space between them blurry.
    *   **Cultural Norms:** Societal expectations pressure mothers to be primary caregivers of their spouse, children, and elder family members. This makes it easy for some mothers to resort to control and harsh discipline.
    *   **Misunderstanding of Care:** Mothers often equate control with love, failing to see it as a destructive force that stunts their daughters emotional growth and the way they view relationships.

3. **Consequences of the Problem:**
    *   **Avoidance of Intimacy:** A person's small and oppressed psychological space leads to a fear of relationships, causing them to feel anxious and want to withdraw when intimacy is attempted, and/or leading them to subconsciously inviting others to invade their own boundaries.
    *   **Emotional Incapacity:** They cannot process high levels of emotional exchange and lack the emotional capacity to navigate interpersonal relationships.
    *   **Potential for Relationship Interference:** Overbearing mothers may interfere with their daughters' relationships, potentially sabotaging them, due to the mother's desire for control.

4.  **Solutions and Considerations**
    *   **Family Support:** The family must collectively reduce the mother's burden by relieving some of her responsibilities, allowing her to focus less on strict control and more on a healthy parent-child relationship.
    *   **Mother's Awareness:** Mothers need to recognize that their actions stem from a place of love, but it is ultimately causing their children harm, and that they must respect their child's independence and boundaries.
    *   **Family Unit:** The overall family is the key to the healthy development of children.

**Core Point:** Early experiences with boundary violations by parents, often due to societal pressures and misguided notions of love and protection, lead to difficulties in forming healthy relationships and processing emotions in adulthood.

**Fundamental Point:**  A child's healthy emotional development depends on parents respecting their boundaries and fostering independence, which requires a collective effort of the whole family unit.

**Overarching Framework:** The overarching framework revolves around the impact of parental control, especially mothers' actions, on a child's emotional and relational development, focusing on the cause-and-effect relationship of boundary violations leading to avoidance of intimacy and emotional difficulties.
