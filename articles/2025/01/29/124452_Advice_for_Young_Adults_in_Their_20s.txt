Status: success

Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Defining Success:**
    *   Success is subjective; there isn't one "right" path.
    *   Avoid pursuing money as the sole goal; it doesn't guarantee happiness.
2.  **Self-Discovery and Path:**
    *   Understand your nature.
    *   Explore different paths and be open to change.
    *   Align your nature with a suitable path.
3.  **True Success:**
    *   Consider if your path brings happiness and satisfaction.
    *   Focus on "self-sufficient plus," which prioritizes happiness over money or status.
4.  **Key Elements:**
    *   Meaningful Work: Love what you do.
    *   Meaningful Relationships: Value your connections.

**Core Point:** Prioritize happiness and satisfaction by aligning your chosen path with your nature, rather than chasing external markers like wealth.

**Fundamental Point:** The key to a fulfilling life is not just achieving material success but pursuing meaningful work and nurturing meaningful relationships that bring you happiness.

**Overarching Framework:** The overarching framework is a personal journey of self-discovery and alignment, where happiness and fulfillment are prioritized over traditional metrics of success.

and you have a lot of young people here that would all like to be you um what advice would you give them from your you know looking back at your 20-year-old self I think the important thing is that you you have the life that you want to have how you define success uh is important I I I I I don't think that there's a right path for success I think that I was lucky in that I fell in love with a game that if I played the game I ended up making a lot of money I don't recommend just going after life that way to make a lot of money I don't think I would have been happy if that was my goal to know your nature right and then to then go down paths and discover and then don't hesitate to change because you're on a journey of matching your nature to with the path that's going to be appropriate for you and then consider success in the in the broader sense of it is it bringing you the happiness I call it you know self-sufficient plus I don't care how much money you make how much status you you make all all of that uh what I care about mostly are are you happy and satisfied and I would say the most important things are meaningful work do you love your work and meaningful relationships
