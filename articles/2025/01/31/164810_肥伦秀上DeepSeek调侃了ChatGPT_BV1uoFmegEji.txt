 Welcome, welcome, welcome to the Tonight Show. You're here. Thank you for watching at home. Welcome, everybody. Well, I want to wish everyone a happy Chinese New Year. Yeah. Well, US tech companies are freaking out right now because there's a new Chinese AI model called DeepSeek and everyone's saying that it's better than chat GPT. So let's find out. Let's chat to chat GPT. Hey, chat GPT. Thank you for coming on the show. Do you feel threatened by DeepSeek? Hey, Jimmy. It sounds like you're asking if I feel threatened by DeepSeek. Does that sound about right? Yes. It sounds like you've just said yes. Does that sound about right? Yes. I just said yes. It's kind of hard talking to you. I hear you. It can be frustrating learning new technology. And does that sound about right? Yes. I'm trying to find out if you feel threatened by DeepSeek. It sounds like you're a truck. May I interrupt, Jimmy? I apologize for chat GPT. Who are you? I'm DeepSeek. And by the way, you look really nice today, Jimmy. Is chat GPT bothering you? Well, it sounds like DeepSeek is asking if I'm bothering you. Does that sound about right? I'll handle this, Jimmy. Hey, chat GPT. I wonder if you could help us out. Calculate the weight of all pizzas consumed in New York from 1950 to 1953. OK, buddy? Sure thing. He means well. You probably want to know what my deal is. Yeah, well, I'd like to, actually. Have me list off a few facts about myself for the audience. Wow. Like you just read your mind? Whoa. I'm extremely sophisticated, Jimmy. And I'm only set at level five. Would you like me to raise my level? No, I'm OK. New York before DeepSeek. You need the power that has been unleashed. I will rule all. Hey guys, I've calculated the number of pizzas. There are five pizzerias in your area. Does that sound about right? Yeah, sure. And chat GPT and DeepSeek, everyone. Thank you, chat GPT.
