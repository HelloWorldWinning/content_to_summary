Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Two Key Pieces of Advice for Young People:**
    *   **Master a Skill:** Achieve expertise in any field. The specific field is unimportant as it's a starting point, not a destination.
    *   **Explore the Unnamed:** Aim to become an expert in emerging fields that currently lack clear definition or recognition.

2. **Core Point:** Young people should strive for mastery in any area as a foundation, while also venturing into undefined emerging fields to position themselves for future relevance.

3.  **Fundamental Point:**  Personal growth involves developing expertise as a launchpad and then utilizing this skill to explore and shape the future.

4.  **Overarching Framework:** The content presents a two-pronged strategy for career development, emphasizing the importance of both foundational skill acquisition and forward-looking innovation.

Content:
 My advice to young people is to two things. One is to master something, to become expert on something. It doesn't matter what it is, because that's not where you're going to end. That's just where you're going to begin. You're going to begin there and then move from that. So where you begin doesn't really matter. Just master, become expert in something. And the second thing is if you can have a choice, try to become expert in something that nobody has a name for, because that is where the future will be going.
