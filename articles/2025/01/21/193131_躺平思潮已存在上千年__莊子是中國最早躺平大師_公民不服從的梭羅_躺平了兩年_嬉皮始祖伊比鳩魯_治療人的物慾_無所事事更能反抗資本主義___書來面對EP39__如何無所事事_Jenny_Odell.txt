Content:
Last time I made a video explaining why young people choose to lie down The audience reacted enthusiastically The book I’m going to face today is “How to “Do Nothing”” Let me teach you how to lie down flat The author of this book is Stanford University artist Jenny Odell The first half of the book I need to first tell you the philosophy of lying flat How to escape the capitalist attention economy The second half will teach you how to turn your attention away from economics Shift to ecological coexistence and local connections with communities Realizing the philosophy of resistance to capitalism Our current legal working hours are eight hours It was won by the American labor movement at the end of the 19th century. The sports theme song at that time was sung "Eight hours of work, eight hours of rest, and eight hours of yourself. " You have eight hours to yourself to bask in the sun and smell the flowers do something useless Instead of using it for self-improvement, working overtime, and making extra money This was the original intention of workers to fight for free time But Italian philosopher Franco Berardi pointed out Since the 1980s Capitalism begins to transform human subjectivity Commercialize one’s self Promote a new idea Everyone can be an entrepreneur Everyone should treat their lives as a brand competition Real entrepreneurs can get back up no matter how many times they fail No matter what happens, make them stronger, do better, be smarter and happier Therefore, true entrepreneurial spirit must first control one's inner self, not the external reality. Labor no longer works 8 hours a day During off-duty hours, you have to freely take on cases, deliver orders, manage social media, and build your personal brand. The original 8 hours after get off work It should allow workers not to work Now these 8 hours have been colonized by capitalism Everyone thinks of themselves as running their own businesses like capitalists But life should be optimized The concept of value maximization itself has problems This is tantamount to treating life as a tool for making money Forgot that life experience itself is the purpose People make money to experience life But many people live just to make money The author said We should resist becoming productive subjects Study Zhuangzi’s Philosophy "Zhuangzi. " It is recorded in "The Human World": A carpenter visited a large oak tree The carpenter said the tree was big and useless Not suitable for use as wood If you use it to make a boat, the boat will sink; if you use it to make a coffin, the coffin will rot. It's a completely worthless tree As a result, the oak tree told the carpenter in a dream Do you want to compare me with those valuable trees? The final fate of those trees is to be chopped down. It’s just because I’m not good enough and no one can cut me down On the contrary, you can survive My uselessness is my greatest use If I use it, can it still grow such a big tree? Zhuangzi’s philosophy is particularly relevant in today’s capitalist society The more one pursues wealth, the more useful he becomes The better to be exploited by the company The result is overtime, overwork, and doing it to death On the contrary, the more useless and wasteful it becomes The more capitalism takes advantage of you, the more it can do nothing The best thing in the world is seeing the smiling faces of our guests I don't care nothing to do On the contrary, you can survive Zhuangzi's philosophy allows us to see that "useful" is actually a very narrow concept. Precisely because capitalism pursues usefulness Leading to endless overconsumption and today’s ecological crisis In comparison Many important things in life It has no use value for capitalism such as household chores such as taking care of the family Seen as unproductive by capitalism You do housework and take care of your significant other The boss won't pay you either But the entire human species can continue to reproduce In fact, it depends on the care of caregivers Capitalism that blindly pursues productivity Let us neglect those who take care of us So artist Mierle Laderman Ukeles has done a lot of "maintenance art" Trying to make visible the care work that capitalism ignores This kind of care is not limited to people Can also be extended to non-humans Like your dog, cat, or pet They provide you with physical and mental comfort after get off work These things are regarded by capitalism as unproductive and unprofitable But they are actually very important to our physical and mental adjustment So doing nothing is not really doing nothing. Instead, do things that capitalism deems unproductive Like doing housework, playing with pets If your boss asks you to work overtime We will immediately become a waste In addition to resisting becoming a productive subject We must also resist the capitalist attention economy Every time there is a new message on social media Many opinion leaders and internet celebrities will speak on Facebook IG Everyone is trying to steal your attention Because traffic is business opportunity These are the capitalist attention economies To generate more profits in exchange for your reach Rather than really caring about social connections So even Bill Gates strictly regulates the time when children can use mobile phones. Facebook engineer Justin Rosenstein prevents children from downloading apps at will Twitter engineers even designed a sliding update after Saying that your design is not good But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t participate in social media But we can choose how to participate It’s okay to reject the ways capitalism wants us to engage Capitalism can exploit your wages and housing prices But I can't take away your free will I can't force you to watch it So attention is the only resource we have at our disposal When we turn off our attention, capitalism takes advantage of us So art critic Jonathan Crary said Sleep is humanity’s last line of defense against capitalism This is why capital companies design various addictive games and streaming video platforms Let you stay up late playing games and watching TV shows Because as soon as you fall asleep, there is less flow and less contact Companies can place ads, but users can also divert their attention to resist every time an ad appears Just divert your attention Don't look, don't listen The philosopher Deleuze believes that People in contemporary society have the right to say nothing Today's society is different from the period of authoritarian rule People are not prohibited from expressing their thoughts Just the opposite In a society with free speech, people make too many rubbish comments Capitalism encourages everyone to speak out Post more on Facebook and IG Only in this way can we earn traffic In an age where people are scrambling to express their opinions Not publishing anything can give people a breather A temporary withdrawal from capitalism When capitalism wants to earn our traffic Let's show our right to say nothing There is a concept in the medieval Catholic tradition It’s called Contemptus Mundi It is to reject this world spiritually Think that the pleasures in this world are short-lived and false Not as good as the eternal God This concept can also be used to combat today’s attention economy Although we have physical limitations It's hard to escape capitalism But we can still say no to capitalism on a spiritual level When social media steals our attention Make you think there is something new every day New controversies, new YouTube videos The discussions we see on Facebook are not reality But the reality created by capitalism At this time we can revive the medieval "renunciation of the world" reject this false reality Don’t read, don’t like, don’t share retain the right to say nothing In addition to resisting the attention economy There is also a more thorough way of lying flat It’s about escaping capitalism. A 28-year-old mainland internet celebrity was laid off due to the epidemic After returning to his hometown in Liaoning, he relied on unemployment benefits to live frugally in the countryside. I have no ambitions in life, I just want to be a happy layman The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus can be said to be the earliest ancestor of lying down He found that urbanites just want to satisfy their empty desires But never satisfied with what they have So in order to make more money You have to work all the time As a result, it keeps going in circles Don’t know the source of happiness So Epicurus left the city and the public Buy a vegetable garden in the countryside on the outskirts of Athens Build your own school locally Trying to use school education to transform people's desires Epicurus believed Live a self-sufficient life in the countryside On the contrary, it allows you to see your desires clearly You will find that many material desires are created by advertising. Not that you really want those products The happiness that people really want is called Ataraxia What is Ataraxia? That is, the soul is free from worldly concerns Get inner peace The human soul needs more than material satisfaction But friendship because of the importance of friendship Therefore, the Epicurean Academy was the only school at that time that admitted non-Greeks, slaves, and women. Invite everyone to come and lie down together Enjoy the happiness of not making money Look at it from the current perspective Epicurus’ schools were like “addiction treatment centers” Human beings are addicted to money and material desires need to be treated So lying down is not just passive resistance. It’s more of a philosophy to treat one’s own desires Epicurus’s act of escaping from material desires The hippie movement became popular again in the United States in the 1960s At that time, young people in the United States were dissatisfied with the government's initiation of the Vietnam War and the apartheid system. Believe that the older generation and those in power are the source of social chaos In addition, the Age of Aquarius movement was popular in society at that time. I think it started in the 1960s Human civilization has entered Aquarius Symbolizing the shift from the material level to the spiritual and environmental level? ? ? Therefore, many young people refuse to buy cars or houses. Raise money with friends to buy a piece of land in the countryside Create your own ideal community commune in rural areas More than 1, 000 communes appeared in the United States from 1965 to 1970s But let’s not think that we can just escape capitalism can build utopia The vast majority of people in these communes are middle-class white people Many people actually bring their existing problems to the communes For example, men have never washed dishes or cooked before So in the commune, women are responsible for these things Many women flee again after discovering these problems Escape brings the problem outside Therefore, the ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus once criticized Epicurus: Are you encouraging everyone to avoid problems? Neglect of civic responsibilities If everyone does what you do, they will subvert the country and destroy the family So the author thinks that we should lie down It’s not about escaping capitalism and never coming back. It happened to be after taking a break from myself for a while Can have a clearer understanding of how the world works See the world clearly and then return to bring changes In 2008, Deloitte accounting firm hired an employee Colleagues asked her what she was doing She said she didn't do anything, she was just thinking about what to do. What are you waiting for. . . ? No, I'm just thinking about what I should do in the elevator Colleagues asked her where she was going She said I wasn't going anywhere Where are you going? I'm just waiting in the elevator for a moment OK I'm trying this mobile place Sure This person has nothing to do in the company It makes other colleagues very impatient It was revealed later It turns out this is an action art piece by artist Pilvi Takala Deliberately pretending to be an idle employee unproductive See how others react The results are experimentally proven Idleness has the potential to threaten work order When you deliberately interrupt your daily work routine People around you will find it strange This reflects that we have actually internalized the work order into our bones. This social experiment is not an escape from capitalism Instead, actively create a structure of rejection. Refusal to be a productive subject the art of refusal Diogenes, a Cynic who dates back to ancient Greece The philosophy of Diogenes is to despise everything that the world considers worthy of pursuit. Because there are cracks in everything society should abide by For example, he believes that education only makes it easier for young people to find jobs after they leave society. Instead of teaching people how to live a good life So the textbook is not worth reading at all He takes action Go and glue the textbook pages together This philosophy of action was very appreciated by Alexander the Great Came here specially to visit Diogenes Tell him: If you need anything, just tell me Diogenes replied: I need you to get out of the way, you're blocking my sunlight When the Macedonians were about to attack his city-state Corinth Everyone is ready to prepare for war Everyone guessed that Diogenes must have nothing to do again Unexpectedly, Diogenes was busy pushing his pottery instead Others ask him what are you doing? He just said Make yourself look as busy as you guys through this irony Revealing what the secular public considers worthy of busyness In fact, I'm just pretending to be busy. You think you are fighting for the economy Work hard to make money In fact, it’s all just mediocrity So Plato called Diogenes the crazy Socrates. Socrates used dialogue to stimulate people's philosophical thinking But Diogenes used action art to awaken the world Unlike Epicurus, who fled to the countryside and built his own utopia Instead, stay in the city and use your actions to prove that the busyness of urbanites is not worth it. Diogenes deliberately wanted to stay in this society Use action to create a rejection in place Tell you what to do when society asks you to You just don't do this Taiwan-born performance artist Hsieh Teh-ching can be said to be the Taiwanese version of Diogenes His artistic performances are full of rejection on the spot For example, his 1985 work "No Art Piece" Just don’t create anything for a whole year Not looking at works of art Not talking about art Living a life without art for a year Why is this kind of doing nothing an art? Xie Deqing said People always say that to make life full of meaning, you must fill up your time But what if we clear the time? Hsieh Teh-ching's performance art is like a kind of in-situ rejection of Taiwanese society Because children in Taiwan have their schedules filled up by their parents since childhood. As if this is a productive life Only when you grow up can you have a good job Taiwanese people all live this kind of arranged punch-in life. Reject this violent structure Hsieh Deqing lived a life of doing nothing for a year This kind of rejection is an art of living I would say all I'm doing is living Because all art comes from life Live life, live art, that is, spend time Let time pass, that's what I'm doing Rejection on the spot can sometimes even lead to social change Like Thoreau, the founder of American civil disobedience He once went to live in seclusion by Walden Pond and lay in bed for two years. Thoreau said: I stay away from the crowd and live a simple life in a cabin because I want to live cautiously See what things are fundamental to life Eliminate all unnecessary things in life So that when I die, I will realize that I have never lived at all The two years of seclusion experience Allowed Thoreau to look at American society at that time from a distance At that time, Americans were all flocking to praise slavery. Waging war against Mexico But Thoreau wrote "On Civil Disobedience": American soldiers who went to fight in Mexico are no more worthy of respect than a piece of soil He advocated "If the essence of the law is to make you an accomplice to injustice, then I would say, just break the law. " If enough people in society choose to exercise moral judgment Instead of continuing to play this unfair game Then this game has a chance to change This theory of civil disobedience became a political philosophy Further influence on later Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. And the reason why Thoreau was able to refine this theory It was because of his seclusion experience that he was able to change his perspective Looking at problems from outside the system Of course, not everyone can easily practice "refuse on the spot" If you are already a low-paid person It’s too late to work hard to make money to support the family It's impossible to say I won't go to work tomorrow This is why mass rejection campaigns always happen to students Because students don’t need to support their families yet Can resist state violence and capitalism regardless of the consequences Now let's do an attention experiment Please count the people looking at the white shirts How many times did they pass the ball in total? The answer is 16 times But when you count the times Have you noticed A chimpanzee appears on the screen This experiment was designed by psychologist Daniel Simons Used to prove that people cannot see things outside their attention span You can't see the chimpanzee if you only look at the man in the white shirt Inattentional blindness We often ignore what is right in front of us Capitalism has caused people in contemporary society to suffer from inattentional blindness Just swiping on my phone Not paying attention to things around you Because there are always new messages on our phones to distract us Within a few minutes I wanted to check my phone In fact, William James, the father of psychology, discovered long ago Human attention is inherently Just assume that there must be something new to pay attention to So attention tends to be attached to new things Distraction is normal On the contrary, it requires willpower to concentrate. So resist the attention economy We must allow things that we have not noticed before to enter our consciousness. What to do? We can create a structure that focuses attention Imagine when you fall in love You'll feel like the world around you completely disappears Because all your attention is on your lover This is how love creates a structure of attention Many works of art can achieve the same effect For example, artist Scott Polach curated art exhibitions 「Applause encouraged」Applause encouraged in this exhibition Participants are prohibited from using mobile phones I could only sit there and watch the sunset for 30 minutes When the sun goes down, please applaud This brief detachment Let your attention be focused on the sunset After it’s over, you’ll see the world from a new perspective Another more famous example It's 4 minutes and 33 seconds of American musician John Cage Nothing is played in this piece of music You can't hear any piano sound for 4 minutes and 33 seconds Only the small sounds from the audience are heard So in fact, every performance is performed by the audience present. Let the audience feel that all the sounds around us can be music What's even more amazing is After leaving the concert hall You will find that the world you hear becomes different Because the performance of 4 minutes and 33 seconds creates a rupture of attention after a moment of silence On the contrary, it will highlight the subtle sounds after amplification Every sound around you becomes crystal clear Your ears finally truly hear the world This is taking advantage of a moment of idleness to create the structure for yourself to focus When we are commuting to and from get off work Most people probably use their mobile phones on the MRT and buses. Focus on the online space And ignore the strangers around you Or every time there is an earthquake in Taiwan The first thing many people do is post on Facebook Originally, the earthquake was supposed to be a natural disaster that brought people back from the Internet to reality. But our attention is controlled by social media In fact, encounters in cyberspace You saw the post on Facebook Or dating software, online communities All set according to your preferences has very clear instrumental value Exclude people you don’t want to see in other words Encounter in cyberspace is a created reality Deliberately use your preferences to attract your attention In the end, we will only come into contact with people who have the same opinions and interests as us But the real philosophy of lying down We must reject the utilitarian orientation of capitalism Make friends without purpose Resisting the attention economy look at the strangers around you Might not help your career Doesn't make you more productive There is no way for you to find love But treat strangers with a Buddhist mentality On the contrary, it will bring more surprises in life Such encounters with strangers are not limited to humans Can also be non-human Because animals and plants can also be our neighbors In fact, before the 18th century, capitalism had not yet expanded to all parts of the world. Many aboriginal languages ​​use anthropomorphic titles to describe mountains, rivers and land. But in the process of capitalist colonization These deep relationships with animals and plants have been belittled as "superstition" and "unscientific" Many Aboriginal languages ​​have been lost Learn the colonizer's language instead That is English In English, it is used to refer to animals and plants Treat animals and plants as lower than humans Ignores hundreds of years of interaction between human ancestors and plants and animals In fact, both parties have evolved together Ecologist Robin Wall Kimmerer points out: The aborigines of North America have collected a plant called cogongrass since ancient times. This collection habit has made cogongrass gradually become dependent on humans. If humans collect too much, it will damage the ecology But if humans don’t collect it, this species will become extinct. Plants and humans need each other's attention to survive So resisting the attention economy is not passively resisting capitalism. Instead, we actively return attention to local ecological areas. Environmental campaigner Peter Berg calls this Bioregionalism Bioregionalism Stop treating humans as the center Animals, plants, mountains and forests can all be our neighbors Start to get to know the local animals, plants, mountains, forests, and rivers and think about how humans and local ecology depend on each other For example, in Taiwan, 500, 000 purple-spotted butterflies used to come to Taiwan to spend the winter every year. But capitalism causes global warming As a result, the number of purple-spotted butterflies coming to Taiwan is decreasing. As a result, people’s eyeballs cannot be separated from their mobile phones You won’t notice that the surrounding ecology has been changed by capitalism On the contrary, Taiwan's aboriginal Rukai people regard the purple-spotted butterfly as a friend. When friends stop visiting your home this year Let them be alert to the seriousness of the problem This bioregionalism is a revolt against capitalism Because capitalism hopes to cut off the connection between man and nature Let people regard nature as a resource that can be commodified The last step in fighting the attention economy Just focus on localization When we lie down and scroll through Facebook and IG See gossip news, industry matches, celebrity controversies Our brains are actually unable to organize this content into a meaningful whole Because they are not related to each other in the first place Media scholar Danah Boyd calls this a breakdown in context The success of many personal brands and Internet celebrities is to take advantage of the collapse of the context In order to make their posts and videos reach more audiences They often interpret things out of context This way you can please everyone Therefore, social media and self-media do not actually promote discussion. Instead, it causes the veins to disappear Resist the business logic of capitalism’s pursuit of traffic We can re-localize communities The philosopher Hannah Olam pointed out many social changes in history It all happens in the space of appearance (space of appearance) Such as cafes, bars, parks People show up in real space, discuss and act together The arguments from both sides stirred up new sparks Only then will new collective strength be generated But on social media The two sides with different opinions usually become more polarized the more they discuss it. Instead, in the space of the real world Can filter out the villagers who only have one mouth to speak For example, a park is a space for showing up Because the park you see now Each relies on local residents showing up to resist capitalist land development. Only then can it survive For example, Glen Canyon Park in San Francisco There is a trail called Gum Tree Girls It is to commemorate the three women who took the lead in blocking the then government to have the highway go through this canyon park Parks are a successful example of resistance to capitalism So to understand who in the past successfully protected the park we see now It’s a way to connect with the local community Showing up to resist also debunks the productivity myth of capitalism Capitalism believes that productivity is building new things But actually Many new constructions are destroying original ecosystems, communities, and public spaces It’s just that these damages are invisible to capitalism So we should not mistakenly think that lying down means opposing progress. The lie-flat philosophy just proves that doing nothing can make more progress than capitalism For example, the Japanese agriculturist Masanobu Fukuoka He invented a natural farming method that does nothing. He once saw an abandoned field covered with green grass Discover that the land has its own wisdom Therefore, we came up with a farming method that does not require fertilizers or irrigation. Direct sow seeds in the fall and use clover instead of traditional fertilizers Not deliberately pursuing capitalist agricultural productivity On the contrary, it can lead to more prosperous orchards Masanobu Fukuoka wrote this philosophy in the book "The Revolution of a Straw" Shocking the Western Ecological Circle West Berkeley local government in the United States in 2017 Want to build a building on the site of a local Aboriginal shell midden He said he wanted to turn this place into a profitable commercial space. Local residents collectively protest Request that the sanctity of this site be preserved cannot be commercialized Instead, they sing, dance and hold ceremonies locally Tribal leader Ruth Orta worked with even landscape architects Transform an underground shell mound into a large-scale memorial site The site has no commercial value But it can let the world witness local culture This is the real progress of a society In today’s video, we systematically introduce the philosophy of lying flat Zhuangzi’s philosophy teaches us to resist the subject of productive forces The more useless I am The more capitalism takes hold of me, there is nothing I can do Deleuzian philosophy teaches us the right to say nothing There is something new on social media that we need to leave a message for we just stay silent Epicurean philosophy teaches us to cure our desires See clearly that the material desires instilled by capitalism cannot make people happy at all The philosophy of Diorgnes and Thoreau teaches us to refuse on the spot When capitalism is rife with injustice We must practice civil disobedience Bioregionalism teaches us to turn our attention to local ecology Rebuilding the connection between people and nature Repair the ecological environment destroyed by capitalism Hanna-Olan's philosophy teaches us the space to show up Show up to resist and protect the unproductive things On the contrary, it can bring real progress to society
