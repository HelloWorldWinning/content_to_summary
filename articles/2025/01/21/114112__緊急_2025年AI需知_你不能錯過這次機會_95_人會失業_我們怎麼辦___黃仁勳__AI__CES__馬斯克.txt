PaPa We are all fuc**d If you know about artificial intelligence What if you still stay on ChatGPT? You were out early. What most people know about artificial intelligence Thought it was just helping us It’s so easy to improve productivity In fact, AI has developed to Will replace 95% of our jobs So in this video I will show you the latest AI development And we will boldly predict The development of AI in 2025 Give you the only way out So everyone remember to listen carefully. Then when PaPa started to study in depth What about what is going to happen in 2025? He thought he could make predictions However he was wrong Big mistake The actual situation is much bigger than we imagined The following will introduce you in detail immediately After analyzing all about 2025 Popular Videos on Artificial Intelligence Trends Chief Information Officer, Technology Founder and reports from top investors and sorted out those What about the connection point that no one has talked about yet? We really don’t know what will happen in 2025 I'm shocked This is no ordinary technology update But human beings are entering a new era Such a testimony It’s really once in a lifetime so i do this I spent a lot of time and effort researching Let me show you right away The world’s top AI bosses What they foresee in 2025 What major changes are about to happen? Remember to fasten your seat belt Artificial intelligence is now packaged into microservices The software is smart inside You can talk to the software Because it understands what you mean You can also connect the software with other software You can connect this AI with other AIs Co-create an AI agent Do you remember Sam Altman? The development of GPT-4 was initially suspended. Is it because he saw that this would turn on AGI? Many people seem to be afraid of AGI. Because many people don't want to Artificial intelligence develops into intelligent organisms When the time comes It might find humans in the way and is disobedient But it turns out that at that time Sam Altman What he worries about is compared with the development of AI in 2025 The worries I had at the beginning were just a piece of cake. Wow! Even Sam Altman Such a cautious artificial intelligence expert He describes it this way Then we can imagine There are definitely many, many The impact of artificial intelligence on us It is unimaginable for us ordinary people now So we must not underestimate The impact of artificial intelligence on our lives It could even overturn our entire world. Do you know Another giant Elon Musk Predicted in April last year in one year We'll see the beginnings of superintelligence And Google’s product team Already in December last year Made this product so crazy Have you seen it? The speed of AI development Even if it exceeds the most optimistic Elon Musk’s predictions No wonder Elon Musk This person is usually very stingy. Look at what he does to his son and his wife No money at all Now we have to persuade the U. S. government Consider giving everyone a basic income What is basic income? Just do nothing Have income every month Can be obtained from the government Then why have this one? Even if you don't do anything, you still have a basic income. It means he has seen it Probably the job of 95% of people will be replaced by artificial intelligence There will be no job in the future Then of course now Elon Musk This idea is just a concept The future U. S. government Will everyone be given the minimum income? The U. S. government already owes so much debt Will you have this ability in the future? if you are like us Not a resident of the United States Is there such a benefit? When these jobs disappear What do we rely on to live? In this crisis, we must be prepared for danger in times of peace. Consider it carefully Otherwise one day we wake up Our jobs disappeared Change it by then then it's too late Imagine We can only type Can I still find a job? Unless of course you're typing this with the Hong Kong government There are still many typist jobs now at the hong kong government But there is no guarantee that one day People like Elon Musk to help the Hong Kong government cut spending These jobs will disappear too These old people What new jobs can I find? So we should take advantage of our youth When you can still learn new things Transform quickly Let me share some scientific knowledge with you AI can be divided into 5 levels Just like us humans go to school Imagine It is a Baby in itself Through continuous data training It can do more things Then its kindergarten is the first level It is the most well-known ChatGPT. At the time, you might have thought that its answer was so imprecise. But actually it was just in kindergarten at that time In just one year That it has finished primary school Promoted to middle school What about when I was in elementary school? It goes beyond simply answering questions It can be inferred What data is reasonable What data is unreasonable I can give you a more precise answer. And on the third floor At the stage of agency? It can already replace people Go do something Let me give you some real examples. Where is the first agent? it went to amazon. com And after searching around Find a certain toilet paper with the best value for money Then it pays and completed the entire purchase What about the other Agent? Just ordered pizza Also paid smoothly and completed the job What about the third agent? He found another agent Ask it to design an advertisement for it and completed the promotion work So you can see The current agent is already A group of swans took action Instead of just one agent working alone This group of agents work together It can be more powerful than a company Because they work for you around the clock and learn and execute faster Then this phenomenon Described as a "cluster" by Bloomberg and Sequoia Capital And 2025 is exactly the "Year of Clusters" It will be just a single Agent in 2024 The agent is working on a task And in 2025 there will be a group of agents The entire network consists of working together sometimes cooperate Sometimes there is competition to solve problems Imagine this scenario You hand a project over to a group of AI agents An AI agent is responsible for breaking down the problem Another is responsible for researching solutions Others test different methods There is also one responsible for supervising quality All this is done in an instant This is not a plot in a science fiction novel. Such a system is currently being constructed Automation in 2025 Nothing happens until you turn it on And once it is turned on It will do all the work in one go Complete all at once So the CIO of Goldman Sachs recently shattered all of his conservative predictions He said he had never seen anything like this before. The speed at which these AIs develop Even better than he is on Amazon The cloud computing revolution we are witnessing is even faster His research shows that by 2025 We have more than just artificial intelligence tools We will also have artificial intelligence employees Think about it Just like you have human colleagues now Then you will have artificial intelligence colleagues And the craziest thing is What will many companies do in 2024? Already quietly preparing for this change We'll have a hybrid workforce in 2025 That is, artificial intelligence subjects plus humans so we will see In the beginning we will be "people" Use artificial intelligence tools to help us Increase our Productivity productivity but after There will be artificial intelligence working with us After a while We are tool people who manage a bunch of artificial intelligence In the end, he is the manager of artificial intelligence to manage these artificial intelligence workers In the end, this boss human Made this group of artificial intelligence will also be disappeared Because there will eventually be an artificial intelligence boss Go ask the AI ​​execs To manage AI workers But everyone should remember one thing Artificial intelligence actually does not require management So their architecture will be more Flat Flatter and more efficient Then the companies we run as human beings will also have to transform. But the good news is Human creativity is still unlimited Just like the emergence of cars Take New York City in one day The workers who shoveled horse shit The job completely disappeared But now in New York City There are more taxi drivers One day Self-driving cars will replace taxi drivers Then if they are creative I will start my next career again. The key is that we can no longer rely on Professional knowledge learned in school Go apply for life Have a job It's about constantly using our creativity to keep pace with the times and is ahead of the times So during this time We can make a lot of money using artificial intelligence But this time won’t be soon Because in the near future Artificial intelligence will be better Use artificial intelligence to make money So we have to hurry But about AI in 2025 The wildest predictions come from inside Google On December 30, 2024 Google's AI chief says we are heading straight Artificial Super Intelligence ASI is gone Not 10 years from now Not 5 years from now But he saw signs this will happen faster Google has always been in the field of artificial intelligence development is the most conservative speaker As their own AI leaders What about when we start talking about super intelligence? Something unprecedented is definitely happening behind the scenes When you realize that Google in December 2024 Stable qubit announced A full 50 years ahead of schedule We're actually already advancing quantum computing And Google is working on real quantum chips Get a head start what we are talking about now is Computing power across multiple universes This has become possible So let me summarize it for you. In 2022 ChatGPT Launch Artificial intelligence kindergarten started We talk to ChatGPT Have conversations with other artificial intelligences We give an instruction it gives an answer By 2024 Already developed to AI Agents AI Agents let's imagine After we gave an instruction That AI is just like a human Help us do something automatically And it can be accomplished The 2025 annual meeting will be about the development of AI clusters Not an AI agent at this time It's a group of AI agents. like the whole team The whole company appears There is investigation that shows an AI agent Its output is 25 times that of humans So imagine After 2025 We can no longer sell time Because the AI ​​agent is No need to rest And do things Hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of times faster than humans We can no longer sell our expertise Because AI learns much faster than us The knowledge we gain after studying in college AI can learn in seconds And it’s not like the ones we studied in university It's already outdated What they learn is more immediate So in the age of AI We still have to sell our brain power Like the industrial revolution, the advent of the steam engine and electricity Let people and animals who previously worked physically All become useless The cows are already basking in the sun on the grass today No need to plow the fields anymore There is no need for a typist today either Unless you still work for the Hong Kong government Those hundreds of civil servants typing What work is left to do? First of all, we are competing with AI Imagine If we were hiring a person If this person is replaced by AI That AI will increase production capacity 25 times So the boss during this period can make a lot of money In fact, I have personally witnessed this kind of thing. Before mainland China opened up, Lots of clothing and electronics It is produced in a factory in Hong Kong Later, mainland China opened up Suddenly the boss in Hong Kong Moved the factory to mainland China Labor costs in mainland China are much lower Able to bear hardships and stand hard work So the boss in Hong Kong They will bring some of their trusted senior officials with them. Go to the mainland to manage these workers Because of cost reduction Hong Kong bosses in the 1990s Make a lot of money My dad was in that era Also make a little money After 2000 Those high-level officials sent from Hong Kong to the mainland for official business No need to go Because the boss has found a cheaper one in mainland China And he manages mainland employees Better management So if you are still doing management today You also need to be prepared for danger Because the boss will also find out AI Agents do not need to be managed They will be very active 24 hours a day to perform their tasks So management jobs will also disappear. Then with the emergence of cluster AI, in the very near future AI and AI can collaborate can make money together In fact, the position of being a boss will also be replaced by AI What's left at the end It’s trust, brand and relationship between people This cannot be replaced by AI Imagine this video today Is entirely made of numbers Chief PaPa and Athena Let me tell you Maybe the content is still exactly the same. But there is a lack of interpersonal relationships So this relationship It cannot be replaced by AI another job It cannot be replaced by AI It just requires a lot of parameters And between the decision and the result There are a lot of random changes For example, let’s buy stocks We need to consider a lot of information And after making a judgment There are many unexpected things or random things achieve investment results up or down Profit or loss Talk to us about the right and wrong decisions no direct relationship This will make AI difficult From big data Get a very simple relationship So if you want to know more In the new AI era what's the job If you can still let us use it I prepared one for everyone A more in-depth video to discuss Especially when it comes to what the school didn’t teach us 5 ways to make money Because today's school was produced in the industrial era Train us to be better workers Better professional talents And these jobs All will be replaced by AI What we need is in the era of AI Leveraging AI Doing things AI can’t do This way our income will be greatly improved So in the era of AI 99% of jobs will be replaced 1% of jobs will earn more than 25 times We use AI Connect with our own values income we can earn It will also double significantly So this may be the era of AI The only way out You can find it in the information column Find link to learn more This video is free and open to everyone for a limited time That PaPa AI is developing so fast So many people will lose their jobs Will the government halt the development of AI? Then the development of artificial intelligence is too fast And there is no way the government can stop it Because now China and the United States are in a technological competition The United States does not do China will do it China wants to surpass the United States will also invest heavily in What we are looking at now Or the development of AI in the United States? Because the United States is in AI development Still a little ahead of China But China is behind it I am also chasing hard we see china In the past, in many industries and sectors There are examples of overtaking in corners later on. I don’t rule out China’s artificial intelligence Also in the short term Developing faster than the United States Give us greater impact and influence Like China’s latest DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Has surpassed ChatGPT in many aspects And the emergence of bean bags It also gave Wen Xinyiyan a new opponent. Kuaishou also launched Keling Following America's Sora Wow! So it can be seen that AI is really Change every aspect of our lives and work So my brother Rich Will keep everyone's attention Investment opportunities brought by AI And I will help you pay close attention The impact of AI on work Then remember to subscribe to our channel Don’t miss our latest sharing So now that you see it, give yourself a thumbs up Give us a like too Then you are welcome to tell us in the message area What are your thoughts on the development of AI?
