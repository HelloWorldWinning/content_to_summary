Description:
好的，这是对你提供的文本的总结，包括核心观点、基本观点、总体框架，以及一个使用 Mermaid 语法生成的概念地图：

**1. 核心观点 (Core Point):**
笛卡尔通过普遍怀疑的方法，最终得出“我思故我在”这一不可动摇的真理，并以此为基础，尝试构建一个可靠的知识体系。
(Descartes, through the method of universal doubt, ultimately arrives at the irrefutable truth of "I think, therefore I am," and uses this as the foundation to try and build a reliable system of knowledge.)

**2. 基本观点 (Fundamental Point):**
人类知识的确定性必须建立在不受感官欺骗、逻辑自洽的理性基础之上，而并非仅仅依赖经验。
(The certainty of human knowledge must be built on a rational foundation free from sensory deception and logical self-consistency, and not merely on experience.)

**3. 总体框架 (Overarching Framework):**
笛卡尔的《第一哲学沉思录》通过三个主要的步骤，即普遍怀疑、确立“我思”的存在、以及证明上帝的存在和不欺骗性，逐步建立一个基于理性的知识体系，以对抗感官的不可靠性以及可能存在的欺骗。
(Descartes' *Meditations on First Philosophy* establishes a rational system of knowledge by using three key steps: universal doubt, establishing the existence of "I think," and proving God's existence and non-deceptive nature. This system aims to combat the unreliability of the senses and potential deception.)

Philosophy is so refreshing, it makes you so happy Each episode introduces you to a philosophical thinker In the past few episodes, we have introduced the three philosophers of ancient Greece. Now we are finally entering modern philosophy Introducing Descartes, the founder of the European rational Enlightenment. Descartes was born in 1596 in the small French village of La Haye It is now called Descartes Village His family is a landed aristocrat Received aristocratic education since childhood Because there was no philosophy department at that time If you want to receive knowledge and education, you must enter the Catholic Church Descartes entered the Jesuits to study mathematics and physics It was also here that I came into contact with the skepticism of medieval philosophy. Makes people doubt their own rational abilities Not enough to understand the truth of the world In the end, you will be humble enough to believe in God Later, Descartes would turn this skepticism around and question God. At the age of 22, the Thirty Years War broke out in Europe Descartes actually joined the Dutch army, possibly to move to the Netherlands Because the French Catholic Church was so powerful at that time little freedom of speech The Netherlands was the country with the freest speech in Europe at the time So Descartes later moved to Amsterdam Lived there for over 20 years While in the Netherlands, I wrote a book "Methodology" in French. Intellectuals at that time all wrote in Latin Descartes deliberately wrote in French It is because he believes that philosophical methods and rational thinking It is regardless of class or gender. Everyone has the ability to do it At a time when women had no way to receive education, Descartes had already popularized philosophy It can be said to be very advanced. This "Methodology" later became the prototype of "Meditations" Descartes published Meditations at the age of 45 The original text is called "Meditations on First Philosophy", with a total of 6 meditations First philosophy means metaphysics Metaphysics is thinking about the existence of God, soul, and world Why talk about soul and God It is possible that Descartes wanted to attract Jesuits to read his book Because the church at that time was an institution that monopolized the authority of knowledge. To change the perspective of human knowledge You have to talk to the intellectuals of the time So today’s video Let us introduce this classic work "Meditations" First in the first meditation Descartes said: Everyone should give themselves at least one chance in life Doubt all the knowledge learned from childhood to university After dismantling all past knowledge Let’s rebuild the foundation of knowledge Descartes called this the "method of universal doubt" As long as there is a little bit of doubt, it means it is not trustworthy. It cannot be regarded as the basis of truth and must be eliminated. Now Descartes asks you to recall: Have you ever experienced being deceived by your senses? Discovered that what we see with our senses is actually false In 1629, a sun dog occurred in Rome. Three suns appear in the sky Apparently an optical illusion Descartes became fascinated with the study of optics ever since Human vision is found to be unreliable Then Descartes went even further and doubted i sit by the fire It's the same feeling as when I dreamed I was sitting by the fire Is there an objective standard that can distinguish dreams from reality? if there is not How do I know I'm not dreaming now? Is it possible that our entire life is a dream? Both Chinese philosophy and Japanese philosophy have discussed this issue In "Full Start" The protagonist has implanted a Cartesian suspicion of his own wife. Make her think reality is just a dream In the end, she chose to commit suicide Here we must pay attention Descartes' skepticism is a tool It is to enable people to access certain knowledge Rather than being used to guide life actions Descartes did not say that all sensory perceptions are false. life may be a dream So if you jump off a building, you can wake up. This is not Descartes' position Doubt is just a tool to help you seek knowledge So how did Descartes respond to this dream problem? He used a painting metaphor The image in my dream They must all be copies of elements that have been experienced before. It's impossible to create something out of nothing Even if you dream of a snake with a human face This is also a combination of real people and snakes No matter how strange the images in the dream are, Still based on reality So even if our life is actually a dream It doesn’t mean that there are no elements of reality in dreams. We can still find certain things in our dreams What does it look like? Knowledge like mathematics still holds true in dreams If you dream that you are taking a math test The mathematics in the dream will still be 1+1 =2 A square doesn't have 5 sides either If you solve a math problem in your dream Still solved a math problem So there are actually many great mathematicians and physicists Can't think of an answer in life Later, I found the answer in my dreams. Like quantum physicist Wolfgang Pauli I just saw the number 137 in my dream This number turns out to be the fine structure constant of the atom. Later, Pauli went to find Jung to interpret his dreams. became a famous case in the history of psychoanalysis This means that mathematical knowledge is still true even in dreams This allowed Descartes to find a deterministic basis So is mathematics the most certain truth? No, Descartes had to doubt even more thoroughly. Even mathematics is doubtful Because even the most unshakable mathematical knowledge may be false But I can prove that there are things in philosophy that are beyond doubt Doesn't that mean that philosophy is more reliable and fundamental than mathematics? Now Descartes says Is it possible that there is a god lying to me? Make me think that mathematical knowledge is the truth? Or maybe man was flawed when he was created As a result, no matter what the inference is, it is wrong? Just like artificial intelligence is not perfect yet So the answer it gives you will also be wrong to god Human beings are artificial intelligence created by God Not perfect compared to God In this way, even mathematical knowledge is no longer credible. Or imagine that there is an evil spirit lying to me Make me mistakenly believe that the world in front of me exists But it’s actually just an illusion Because human sensory experience is all about perception sending signals to the brain So even if you send a false stimulus signal The brain will also feel that it is real reality This isn't real? What is reality? How do you define reality? If you are talking about something you feel, smell, taste, see That reality is just an electronic signal interpreted by your brain Man may just be a brain that has been deceived Maybe not even a body This is the thought experiment "The Unified Brain" proposed by the philosopher Putnam The prototype is Descartes’ evil spirit Why did Descartes raise this problem of evil spirits? Because in 17th century Europe Rumors of witches often circulated in the Catholic Church The most famous case was that of 1634 There are reports of people being possessed by evil spirits at the monastery in the Loudun area A local priest, Urbain Grandier, was accused of witchcraft Must be tried in court But all witch-hunting courts will encounter a problem: If a witch could cast a spell to deceive a judge The judge may lose the ability to make rational judgments The result of the trial is simply not credible. If even the court responsible for arbitrating right and wrong, truth and falsehood could be deceived Then there is no ultimate guarantee for human knowledge The Taiwanese movie "Two Eyes" actually plays out this incident. After the policeman who handled the case rationally was haunted by an evil spirit The judgments made by the police began to lose their rationality. turned into superstition There is no way to handle the case As long as the evil spirit problem is not solved Human knowledge is not guaranteed Even mathematics that is closest to the truth may be false So the entire modern Western philosophy is actually an exorcism session. To get rid of the evil spirit of Descartes The pursuit of certainty in human knowledge Ensure that humans will not be deceived Then Descartes will propose his answer After doubting that everything is untrustworthy Descartes is trying to find something that is beyond doubt Archimedes only needs to find a point outside the earth You can use levers to lift the earth Similarly, Descartes believed that as long as he could find something beyond doubt can be used to construct the entire philosophical system Human knowledge system is like a tree Philosophy and metaphysics are the foundation, physics is the backbone Other disciplines are branches We have already demonstrated in the previous meditation Everything I've ever experienced could just be a dream Maybe the evil spirits want me to believe Now Descartes further argued: If I dream that I'm walking I'm not actually walking This is just an illusion in my mind So you can't say I walk therefore I exist Because you're not walking at all But if you suspect that you dreamed that you were walking When you doubt in your dream, you can be sure that your mind exists Even if what I think is false It doesn’t matter if it’s all just a dream I can at least be sure There is a subject who doubts these contents You use reason in your dreams Use reason with you when you're awake is using the same ability Just like you solved a math problem in your dream Still solved a math problem This reasoning was actually inspired by the philosopher Augustine Augustine said: You can lie to me as much as you can But the more you cheat On the contrary, the more it proves that I exist Because there must be something out there that you are deceiving Otherwise who is being deceived? So Descartes said: "If I am deceived, there is no doubt that I exist." Every time I suspect I'm being cheated, I exist And doubt is a kind of thinking activity So when I think I exist This is what "I think, therefore I am" means It is not a causal logical proposition but an existential proposition It means that "I think" automatically implies "being" In comparison My actions may not exist Because I might be dreaming Not really in action My body doesn’t necessarily exist either Because maybe the evil spirit deceived me Make me think I have this body This highlights the difference between humans and animals Your dog may dream about walking But he won't doubt that what he's walking on is a dream I won’t doubt that my body is fake So for Descartes, animals have no cogito But what does this “I” that I think therefore “I” am refer to? I'm not referring to your body by this. Because the body does not necessarily exist Could that be the brain? After all, I can't think without a brain. But this view only became popular after the rise of brain science in the 20th century. Descartes believed that the brain was a material entity just like the body. May be deceived by dreams and evil spirits So I can't be any physical entity but a spiritual entity that engages in skeptical thinking Descartes called Cogito Man is composed of two entities The physical body is a physical entity I think is a spiritual entity Some philosophical books equate Descartes' cogito with "consciousness" This is actually not correct Because what we are talking about now as consciousness refers to brain activity. But what Descartes said about the cogito is that it continues to exist even after your brain stops functioning. So the cogito is actually closer to what we call the soul Now we finally have certain knowledge The real world is suspect But there is no doubt that I think This led Descartes to draw a conclusion The nature of mind is easier to understand than the nature of matter We know that the nature of the mind is the cogito What is the nature of matter? Descartes said, look at a piece of honey looks yellow Tastes sweet It feels hard But if you heat this piece of honey and melt it its shape, color, size, taste Everything has become different So is the same piece of honey still there? Of course it exists It has not evaporated But my eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body all feel different things The sensory knowledge I acquired in the last second The next second it suddenly stopped working. So we have to ask what is constant behind this? Honey can change form But no matter how it changes It will take up space and have length, width and height This is called "extension" in philosophy Even though the physical world is constantly changing We can still grasp an unchanging essence It is the expansion of matter: it has length, width, height, volume, and position. Descartes believed that this was the difference between humans and animals. If you show a dog a piece of solid honey With melted honey It cannot recognize that the two are actually the same thing But humans can Because people don’t know through their senses Rather, reason tells us Although honey has changed its form But it still continues in the same time and space So it must be the same thing in other words When you see a piece of honey deformed You think you are using emotion But the practical thing is rationality Only then can I be sure that this is the same thing. After the emergence of contemporary virtual reality technology Descartes’s sensory skepticism often appears in movies In "Spider-Man: Far From Home" Mysterio can change his appearance using virtual reality At this point Spider-Man must rely on non-sensory knowledge To confirm that the other person is the same person Happy, is that you? Happy, is that you? 当然是我 Is it me? Yeah, of course it's me. Stop and tell me something only you know Stop! Tell me something only you would know. Something only I know... Only I would know... Do you remember that time we went to Germany? Remember we went to Germany? You ordered a paid video in the room You pay-per-viewed a video in your room? They didn’t list the title but at checkout They didn't list titles, but I could tell by the price As soon as I looked at the price, I knew you had watched porn it was an adult film at the front desk. You still don’t know how I found out And you didn't know how I knew. Okay, I know it’s you, stop talking okay fine. it's you. Stop. Descartes's theory overturned the mainstream Aristotelian philosophy at the time Aristotle said that the essence of honey is not expansion. It’s the principle and purpose behind bees producing honey. This is the key to what makes honey different from nectar But for Descartes Human beings cannot determine whether the properties of nectar and honey are just illusions of human senses. The only thing that is certain is that they all have extension, length, width and height. This makes Descartes' philosophy the origin of modern geometry The XYZ axes of geometry we use today were invented by Descartes. So they are called Cartesian coordinates This is the first time that humans have used mathematical methods to understand geometry. In the world of geometry, knowing an object means calculating its extension It doesn’t matter what the color, temperature, or taste of the object is. Because they can change So later the 20th century philosopher Husserl said Cartesian philosophy is the mathematization of nature On the one hand, it paves the way for the scientific revolution in the West But it also sowed the seeds of crisis for modern society. Thinking that mathematical rationality can solve problems in nature After finding the certain knowledge that only "I think" exists Descartes now wants to provide us with a reliable criterion for truth Descartes said: When you see 2+3=5 You won’t ask again why it can’t be equal to 6 Or like the Pythagorean theorem of geometry I can prove it to you with a few pictures. No need to say anything more This is as clear as mathematics No need to explain We can no longer doubt it It is a standard for something to be true Descartes called it clear or distinct. On the contrary, liberal arts knowledge often requires a lot of explanations Because this knowledge is not clear and clear There are a lot of things to be suspicious of We said in the first meditation Maybe I thought the math knowledge was correct It's because God is lying to me This problem is more serious than the evil spirit problem Because this directly questions that God may be an evil spirit deceiving mankind. Like Taiwan’s previous ghost film “The Curse” That is, people think they are worshiping "gods" or "buddhas" Later it was discovered that it was actually an evil spirit In this way, the certainty of knowledge is shaken So now Descartes has to go toe-to-toe to answer God's deceptive question First prove the existence of God Let’s prove again that God doesn’t lie to people How to prove it Descartes first distinguished three concepts of people: The first is foreign concepts First encounter it in reality, and then form these concepts in your mind Because Descartes' opponents at that time were all empiricists. Believe that ideas must originate from sensory experience To have the concept of horses, you must first see horses After seeing many horses, you will gradually form an abstract concept of horses. So God must not be like this Because God has no image and cannot be known through the senses The second idea is a fabricated idea For example, monsters in fairy tales do not exist in the real world. Just human fiction Is it possible that God is just a fictional concept created by humans? Descartes said Although God does not exist in the real world, this does not mean that He is fictional Think about it if you have a favorite food But it has been discontinued and does not exist in this world When you desire something that does not exist, your desire is still real In 1998, McDonald’s promoted the Disney movie Mulan In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film Mulan, At that time they made a new sauce for Chicken McNuggets called Sichuan Sauce where they created a new sauce for the mcnuggets called szechuan sauce 很好吃 and it's delicious. Later they stopped selling them and now they are gone And then it got rid of it and now it's gone. I can only taste it in my memory this is the only place we're gonna be able to try. it is in my memory. Desire for something that does not exist is not a false delusion The opposite of You think you can still eat the food even though it is no longer on sale. This is just an illusion. Even if no one has ever seen God in real life It does not mean that people’s concept of God is false. So Descartes said that the idea of ​​God is neither foreign nor fabricated. It's an innate concept Descartes believed that cogito, mathematics, and God were all innate concepts. Just because you are born doesn’t mean it will automatically appear in your heart. Mathematics concepts are innate But only with the guidance of a teacher can people's natural abilities be stimulated. Likewise, the idea of ​​reason and God is innate But this does not mean that everyone will use reason or believe in God. Just say it like Descartes The Aboriginal people of Canada have innate knowledge of reason and God. It's just that they don't know Descartes believed that reason, the ability to know God, did not distinguish between races. Instead, after the rise of racism in the 18th century Later philosophers Kant, Hegel, Heidegger They all believe that only Europeans are rational So the Chinese audience friends here No, don’t get me wrong, I’m not targeting you. I mean everyone here is trash. So Descartes’ views are actually very ahead of his time. Later the 20th century linguist Noam Chomsky called himself a Cartesian the idea that grammatical structures are innate Because when children are learning language Can understand sentence structures that have never been heard before Moreover, when children say something wrong, parents will not correct them, but find it funny. That child should continue to say wrong things but in fact no This means that grammar is the same as mathematics It is all knowledge that is innate in the human mind. Now we know for sure that God is not a fantasy It's an innate concept So how can we prove that having this concept guarantees the existence of God? Descartes proposed two arguments First, human perception is limited and imperfect Because people will have doubts and uncertainties But God is an infinite concept, all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good How can finite humans conceive of an infinite God? Infinite existence should also have an infinite reason Because there must be a cause if there is an effect But imperfect humans cannot conceive of a perfect God The concept of God must not have been thought up by humans themselves But God implanted it in human hearts So God must exist Here comes the second argument You think you exist because your parents gave birth to you But Descartes said In life, every moment is independent You existed at one moment, and it cannot be inferred that you will continue to exist at the next moment. Because existence has no inertia The material world cannot exist on its own Unless there is some force that continues to ensure the existence of the world ??? This power is God Even if your parents gave birth to your body If there were no God maintaining the existence of the material world every moment The entire universe may cease to exist in the next second. The reason why we can continue to exist proves that God must exist So Descartes' universe is a bit like a movie Halfway through the movie, if the power suddenly goes off The whole movie just disappeared There must be an announcer (God) out there supervising To ensure that the movie can be played completely Now Descartes came up with a proof of the existence of God But that doesn’t break the possibility that God is a liar Descartes said: Since God is perfect and infinite There's no way he could be a liar Because deception represents an imperfection, a shortcoming Only people can be deceived and deceived If God is not a liar The problem in the first meditation is solved etc. Descartes sounds a lot like a circular argument here You say God must be a perfect being Then I ask you how do you know that this God exists? You also said that because humans are limited Must be guaranteed by God to exist Then why does this God not lie to people? You also said that because God is a perfect being The whole argument sounds like a bullshit. So later people criticized Descartes did not really solve the problem of "God deceives people" In today's video, we introduce the first three meditations of Descartes' "Meditations" The first meditation, using universal doubt, denies the reality of the senses Second Meditation, discovering that the nature of the mind is the cogito And my thinking guarantees my existence Third Meditation, proving that God exists and that God is not a liar These three meditative steps In fact, it reflects the tradition of "spiritual training" that Descartes received in the Jesuits. The church’s spiritual exercises first allow believers to close their senses and deny external reality. Let’s cleanse the impurities in the soul Finally become one with God These three steps correspond exactly to First Meditation on Skepticism second contemplative inner self Third Meditation on Affirming God So Descartes actually philosophized the church tradition. But these three musings also leave many questions If the cogito is a spiritual entity, what is its relationship to my body? If God really exists, why did he create imperfect humans whose senses are deceived? The proof of God has been criticized as a circular argument. How did Descartes explain it? When a philosopher's thoughts are contradictory These contradictions often have deeper meanings It highlights some of the pressures and limitations that philosophers face when constructing theories In the next video, we will continue to explore the last three meditations of Descartes. Answer these questions for everyone
