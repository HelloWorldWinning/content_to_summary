Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   Copper prices are highly volatile and difficult to predict using traditional statistical models.
    *   Accurate copper price prediction is crucial due to its economic importance.
2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   A hybrid Neural Network model is proposed for copper price forecasting.
    *   This model integrates:
        *   **Wavelet Transform:** Used for data denoising and removing irrelevant information.
        *   **Bayesian Optimization:** Used for hyperparameter tuning in the neural network.
        *   **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU):** Used for time series forecasting.
3.  **Results:**
    *   The hybrid model (using either LSTM or GRU) demonstrated accurate short- and long-term copper price predictions.
    *   Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both LSTM and GRU models were below 3%.
    *   The model is robust to noise and efficiently finds optimized hyperparameters.
4.  **Broader Applicability:**
    *   The model's methodology can be readily applied to predict the prices of other commodities, like stocks.

**Core Point:** A hybrid neural network model combining Wavelet Transform, Bayesian Optimization, and LSTM/GRU can effectively predict volatile copper prices with high accuracy and robustness.

**Fundamental Point:** This research demonstrates a practical methodology using advanced neural network techniques to address the challenges of forecasting complex time-series data such as commodity prices.

**Overarching Framework:** This research employs a data-driven modeling approach using a hybrid neural network framework to tackle the complexities of time-series forecasting in commodity markets. It leverages signal processing (Wavelet Transform), optimization (Bayesian Optimization), and deep learning (LSTM/GRU) to improve prediction accuracy.

The metal prices play an important role in many aspects of economics. Copper, a widely used metal in the industry, has received an extensive attention recently. Due to the high fluctuations in copper price that makes it difficult to predict especially when using the traditional statistical models, in this work, a hybrid Neural Network with Bayesian Optimization and Wavelet Transform is applied to forecast the copper price in both short- and long-terms, in which Bayesian Optimization Algorithm is used on the hyperparameter searching task, the Wavelet Transform is applied to denoise the data and eliminate the irrelevant information, and Long Short Time Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are employed to train the data and predict future copper price, respectively. The results indicate that our methods, either LSTM or GRU, can appropriately predict the copper price for both short- and long-terms with mean squared error both below 3% and this hybrid Neural Network is robust to remove the irrelevant information and search the optimized set of hyperparameters. Meanwhile, it is easily and readily applicable to predict the prices of other commodities (i.e., stock market).
