Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   Copper prices are highly volatile, making accurate prediction challenging with traditional statistical models.

2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   A hybrid Neural Network model is used for copper price forecasting.
    *   **Components:**
        *   **Bayesian Optimization:** Optimizes hyperparameters of the neural network.
        *   **Wavelet Transform:** Denoises the data and eliminates irrelevant information.
        *   **LSTM/GRU:**  Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units to train and predict price data.

3.  **Results:**
    *   The hybrid models (LSTM and GRU) can effectively forecast copper prices in both short and long term.
    *   Mean Squared Error (MSE) is below 3% for both models.
    *   The hybrid method is robust against noisy data and effectively optimizes model parameters.

4.  **Broader Implications:**
    *   The methodology is readily applicable to predict prices of other commodities, such as in the stock market.

**Core Point:** A hybrid neural network combining Bayesian optimization, wavelet transform, and LSTM/GRU effectively predicts volatile copper prices in both short and long terms with high accuracy.

**Fundamental Point:** Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques can overcome the limitations of traditional statistical models in forecasting complex and volatile commodity prices.

**Overarching Framework:** The content introduces a novel hybrid machine learning framework for improved commodity price forecasting that combines data preprocessing, parameter optimization, and time series prediction.

Content:
The metal prices play an important role in many aspects of economics. Copper, a widely used metal in the industry, has received an extensive attention recently. Due to the high fluctuations in copper price that makes it difficult to predict especially when using the traditional statistical models, in this work, a hybrid Neural Network with Bayesian Optimization and Wavelet Transform is applied to forecast the copper price in both short- and long-terms, in which Bayesian Optimization Algorithm is used on the hyperparameter searching task, the Wavelet Transform is applied to denoise the data and eliminate the irrelevant information, and Long Short Time Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are employed to train the data and predict future copper price, respectively. The results indicate that our methods, either LSTM or GRU, can appropriately predict the copper price for both short- and long-terms with mean squared error both below 3% and this hybrid Neural Network is robust to remove the irrelevant information and search the optimized set of hyperparameters. Meanwhile, it is easily and readily applicable to predict the prices of other commodities (i.e., stock market).
