Description:
Okay, here's a summary of the provided content, adhering to your specific requirements:

**Summary Outline:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   Stock market collapses (drops >10%) are difficult to predict due to market volatility.
    *   Various factors trigger these crashes (corporate results, geopolitical issues, financial crises, pandemics, etc.).

2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   A Hybridized Feature Selection (HFS) model is developed to predict stock market crises.

3.  **Model Steps:**
    *   **Step 1:** HFS removes unnecessary stock financial attributes.
    *   **Step 2:** Naive Bayes classifies strong fundamental stocks.
    *   **Step 3:** Stochastic Relative Strength Index (StochRSI) identifies stock price bubbles.
    *   **Step 4:** Moving average statistics pinpoint crisis points in stock prices.
    *   **Step 5:** Deep learning (GRU, LSTM) predicts crises.

4.  **Evaluation:**
    *   RMSE, MSE, and MAE are used to evaluate model performance.
    *   HFS-based GRU model outperforms the HFS-based LSTM model.

5.  **Dataset:**
    *   The model was tested using Pakistan stock market data.

6.  **Future Research:**
    *   Explore additional technical factors for predictions.
    *   Further optimize the GRU approach with new optimizers.

**Core Point:**
A hybridized feature selection approach combined with deep learning techniques can effectively predict stock market crises.

**Fundamental Point:**
Predicting stock market crashes requires a multi-faceted approach combining feature selection, fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and advanced learning models.

**Overarching Framework:**
The overarching framework is a data-driven, multi-step approach that leverages feature selection, fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and machine learning to predict stock market crises.

Content:
A Stock market collapse occurs when stock prices drop by more than 10% across all main indexes. Predicting a stock market crisis is difficult because of the increased volatility in the stock market. Stock price drops can be triggered by a variety of factors, including corporate results, geopolitical tensions, financial crises, and pandemic events. For scholars and investors, predicting a crisis is a difficult endeavor. We developed a model for the prediction of stock crisis using Hybridized Feature Selection (HFS) approach. Firstly, we went for the suggestion of the HFS method for the removal of stock's unnecessary financial attributes. The Naive Bayes approach, on the other hand, is used for the classification of strong fundamental stocks. In the third step, Stochastic Relative Strength Index (StochRSI) is employed to identify a stock price bubble. In the fourth step, we identified the stock market crisis point in stock prices through moving average statistics. The fifth is the prediction of stock crises by using deep learning algorithms such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are implemented for assessing the performance of the models. The HFS-based GRU technique outperformed the HFS-based LSTM method to anticipate the stock crisis. To complete the task, the experiments used Pakistan datasets. The researchers can look at additional technical factors to forecast when a crisis would occur in the future. With a new optimizer, the GRU approach may be improved and fine-tuned even more.
