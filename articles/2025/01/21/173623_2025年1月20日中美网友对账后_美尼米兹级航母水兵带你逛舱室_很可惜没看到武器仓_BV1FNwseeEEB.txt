 I got the reach and the teeth of a killing machine Well I need to bleed you with a high ghost ring Best believe I'm in the zone to be From a end to my hand and behind the sea Boy I'm real, I'm a shit when you come to me Cause I'm weird, I'm a one of a kind and I'll bring death To the place you're about to be Another river of blood running under my feet Boys in a fire that long ago Stand next to me, you'll never stand alone I'm last to leave, but the first to go Lord, make me death before you make me I'll feed on the fear of the devil inside Of the enemy faces in my sight Aim with a hand, shoot with a mind Cue with a heart like Arctic ice I am a soldier and I'm marching on I am a soldier and I'm marching on I am a warrior, this is my song I am a warrior and this is my song I'm last to enroll with the rise in war They've reached to the ground of an enemy shore We into the blood spilled on the floor If another one stands I'll kill some more Pull it in the beach in the fire And eat like a cigarette thrown to gasoline If death don't bring you fear I swear You'll fear these marching feet Come to the nightmare, come to me Deep down in the dark with a devil of me In the mall with the trolls and the razor Deep with a brimstone burns in the angel wings Rolled the gods of a cross your path In my silhouette hangs like a body mat Hope is a moment now long past The shadow of death is the one I cast I am a soldier and I'm marching on I am a warrior and this is my song My eyes are steel and my gaze is low I drive my hands, I am a warrior and this is my song We're not just going to shoot the bastard We're going to cut out their living guts And use them to reach the dreads of our tanks We're going to murder those lousy bastards By the bush Now I'm deflating, I need to unthink the rage When the least of me is still out of your reason The kill of a city is gonna do the deed Until the river runs dry and will last my dreams The cheer that the air with the head held high I'll stand in the path of the enemy line Feel no fear, I know my pride For God and control into a life I am a soldier and I'm marching on I am a warrior and this is my song My eyes are steel and my gaze is low I am a warrior and this is my song I am a warrior and this is my song I've got the reach and the teeth of a killing machine Where the need to bleed you with the light goes green Best believe I'm in the zone to be From a end to my aim to me, aim to see What a real emotion when you come with me Cause I'm weird, I'm a one of a kind And I'll bring death To the place you're about to be Another river of blood running under my feet Poisoning a fire that long ago Stand next to me, you'll never stand alone I'm last to me, but the first to go Lord, make me death before you make me I'll feed all the fear of the devil inside Of the enemy faces in my sight Aim with a hand who shoot with a mind Feel the heart like our king guys I am a soldier and I'm marching on I am a soldier and I'm marching on I am a warrior and this is my song I am a warrior and this is my song I'm last to the road with a rising water They waste to the ground of an enemy shore We into the woods filled on the floor And if another one stands I'll kill some more Pull it in the breach and a fire and be like a cigarette thrown The gas to me, if death don't bring you fear I swear you'll fear these marching feet Come to the nightmare, come to me Deep down in the dark with the devil me In the mall where the trolls in the raisage Where the brimstone burns and the angel reeks Rolled the goth to our cross or path In the silhouette hangs like a bodyguard Hope is a moment now long past The shadow of death is the one I cast I am a soldier and I'm marching on I am a warrior and this is my song My eyes are steel and my gaze is on my track
