Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Artistic Concept:**
    *   The artist uses a "vaginal engine" concept to describe movement.
    *   A chain attached to a red camera records these movements.

2.  **Movement and Color Shift:**
    *   Initially, red color is concentrated in the internal organs.
    *   Movement (shaking head, wagging tail) causes the red to descend.
    *   Red color shifts to the lower body, especially the legs and feet.
    *   The hands, feet, and head become pure red, implying blood flow to extremities.

3.  **Core Point:** The artistic performance visually depicts the redirection of energy and blood flow from the core to the extremities through movement captured by a "vaginal engine" concept.

4.  **Fundamental Point:** The piece explores the physical and energetic transformation of the body through the recording of movement and the shifting of color.

5.  **Overarching Framework:** The content utilizes a metaphorical "vaginal engine" to visually and symbolically express the internal dynamic of energy flow within a body, recorded through movement and color changes.

Content:
 The artist recorded every movement as a vaginal engine using a chain for red camera. It's clear that from the shaking the head and, wagging the tail to dispel hard fire, the red areas originally, concentrated in the internal organs, gradually sink to the lower body. The lower legs and feet become warmer. The hands, feet and head of pure red, as key and blood being directed to the extremities.
