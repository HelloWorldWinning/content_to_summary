Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Core Problem:**

*   The increasing adoption of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) requires accurate site-adaptive forecasting models.
*   Traditional methods developing individual models for each DSG are not feasible due to the large number of DSGs and limited historical data.

**II. Proposed Solution:**

*   Adapt the attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to forecast DSG power output.
*   Utilize a single, generalized model trained on existing DSG data and applicable to unseen DSGs.
*   Evaluate the model, named Solar TFT (STFT), on real-world data from 188 DSGs.

**III. Experimental Results & Findings:**

*   STFT outperforms the persistence model significantly, with improvements of 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10, 20, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively, when tested on unseen DSGs.
*   STFT also shows improved forecast accuracy compared to an LSTM model, with gains of 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% at 10, 20, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively.
*   STFT demonstrates robustness across varying weather conditions, especially in handling high-variability periods like weather transitions.
*   STFT has a higher computational cost compared to other deep-learning models.

**IV. Trade-off:**

*   A trade-off between higher forecasting accuracy (STFT) and lower computational efficiency must be considered.

**V. Core Point:**

The proposed Solar TFT model offers a generalized solution for forecasting power output in distributed solar generation systems, demonstrating superior accuracy over existing methods, particularly in challenging conditions, albeit at a higher computational cost.

**VI. Fundamental Point:**

This work validates the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in a temporal fusion transformer model for multi-step forecasting of distributed solar power generation, offering a practical approach to addressing real-world prediction challenges.

**VII. Overarching Framework:**

This research utilizes machine learning, specifically by adapting a temporal fusion transformer, to address the challenge of forecasting power output in distributed solar generation networks, accounting for limited historical data by seeking a generalized forecasting model.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
