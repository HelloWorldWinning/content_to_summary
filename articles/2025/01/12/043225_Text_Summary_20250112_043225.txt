Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   The rise of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) requires accurate forecasting models for individual sites.
    *   Traditional methods, which create separate models for each DSG, are not practical due to the large number of DSGs and limited historical data.

2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Adapt the attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model, called Solar TFT (STFT), for DSG forecasting.
    *   Validate the STFT model using 188 real-world DSG datasets, testing its generalizability to unseen DSGs.

3. **Results:**
    *  STFT outperforms the persistence model by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% for 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively, demonstrating significant improvement.
    *  Compared to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, STFT achieves 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% better accuracy for the same forecast horizons.
    * STFT shows advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods.

4. **Trade-offs:**
    * STFT model is more complex and computationally expensive than other deep-learning models.
    * The trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational cost must be considered for implementation.

5. **Weather Condition Analysis:**
    * STFT performs well under all weather conditions (clear, partly cloudy, and overcast).
    * It demonstrates specific benefits in high variability periods like weather transitions.

**Core Point:** The study validates the STFT model's superior accuracy in forecasting DSG power output, especially on unseen sites and during periods of high variability.

**Fundamental Point:** Applying a generalized, attention-based model like STFT offers a viable solution for accurate short-term solar forecasting for numerous distributed sites with limited historical data, even with the cost of greater complexity.

**Overarching Framework:** This research focuses on addressing the challenges of forecasting distributed solar power generation at scale by adapting a sophisticated machine learning model and validating it across real-world data, highlighting its advantages and limitations.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
