Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Challenge:**
    *   The rise of small-scale distributed solar generation (DSG) requires accurate forecasting for unseen DSGs.
    *   Developing individual models for each DSG is not feasible due to their numerousness and a lack of historical data.

2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Adapt an attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model, named solar TFT (STFT), for multi-step time series forecasting.
    *   Validate the generalizability of the self-attention mechanism using 188 real-world operational DSG datasets.

3.  **Results:**
    *   STFT significantly outperforms the persistence model, with improvements of 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively.
    *   STFT also surpasses representative deep-learning models like LSTM, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the same horizons.

4. **Trade-offs:**
   * STFT's model architecture is more complex, leading to higher computational costs compared to other deep-learning models.
   * The balance between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered.

5.  **Weather Impact:**
    *   STFT performs well in all conditions, excelling in high variability periods, including weather transitions.

**Core Point:**
The self-attention mechanism of the adapted TFT model (STFT) offers improved forecast accuracy and generalizability for distributed solar generation (DSG) power output prediction, especially in unseen and highly variable conditions.

**Fundamental Point:**
While more computationally expensive, the STFT model presents a significant step forward for improving the accuracy of DSG forecasts by leveraging its sophisticated self-attention mechanism for complex time series forecasting, especially in the absence of large amounts of historical data.

**Overarching Framework:**
The study addresses the challenge of forecasting power output for numerous small-scale, urban distributed solar generators (DSGs) with limited historical data. It proposes and evaluates an adapted attention-based TFT model (STFT) to enhance forecast accuracy and generalizability. This framework revolves around the need for efficient and accurate forecasting models for widespread DSGs, and how STFT addresses that using self-attention mechanisms, while acknowledging computational trade-offs.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
