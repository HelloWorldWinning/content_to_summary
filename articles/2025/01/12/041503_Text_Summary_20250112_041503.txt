Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   Small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) requires accurate forecasting.
    *   Lack of historical data for individual DSGs makes conventional modeling approaches impractical.
    *   The need for a generalizable model applicable to unseen DSGs.

2.  **Solution:**
    *   Adaptation of the attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model (named Solar TFT or STFT).
    *   Validated on 188 real-world operational DSG datasets.
    *   Exploits the generalizability of the self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting.

3.  **Results:**
    *   STFT significantly improves upon the persistence model, with improvements of 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% for 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively.
    *   STFT outperforms specialized time series deep learning models like LSTM by 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% at the same forecast horizons.
    *   STFT is especially effective during high variability and weather transition periods.

4.  **Limitations:**
    *   STFT has higher computational cost than other deep learning models due to its more complex architecture.
    *   A trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency needs to be considered in real applications.

**Core Point:** The proposed Solar TFT (STFT) model provides more accurate multi-step time series forecasts for distributed solar generation (DSG), even for unseen DSGs without training data, by adapting the self-attention mechanism.

**Fundamental Point:** The research demonstrates that adapting the TFT model's self-attention mechanism can provide a generalizable and accurate solution for forecasting power outputs in distributed solar generation (DSG), particularly where historical data is scarce.

**Overarching Framework:** The work explores a transfer learning-like approach for distributed solar forecasting, using the attention mechanism of a transformer model to achieve generalizability across multiple sites, moving beyond site-specific models. The study identifies a practical trade-off between increased accuracy and computational cost, emphasizing the need for context-specific deployment decisions.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
