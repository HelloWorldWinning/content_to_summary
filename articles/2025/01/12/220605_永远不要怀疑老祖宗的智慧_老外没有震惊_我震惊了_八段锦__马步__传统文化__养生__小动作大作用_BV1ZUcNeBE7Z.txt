Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Core Idea:**
    *   The artwork depicts the artist's body as a "vaginal engine," with movements recorded using a chain for red camera.
    *   The recording captures a shift of heat/redness within the body.
    *  Initially, heat/redness is concentrated in the internal organs.
    *   Through movement (shaking, wagging), the heat/redness sinks to the lower body.
    *  The extremities (hands, feet, head) become the focal point of red.

2.  **Core Point:** The artwork uses movement to visually represent a redistribution of internal heat, portrayed as a shift in red, within the body.

3.  **Fundamental Point:** The artwork explores the body's internal dynamics and the flow of energy through physical motion.

4.  **Overarching Framework:** The content describes a conceptual artwork that uses the body, movement, and color (red) to express a metaphorical transformation or energy transfer, likely related to personal or physical experience.

Content:
 The artist recorded every movement as a vaginal engine using a chain for red camera. It's clear that from the shaking the head and, wagging the tail to dispel hard fire, the red areas originally, concentrated in the internal organs, gradually sink to the lower body. The lower legs and feet become warmer. The hands, feet and head of pure red, as key and blood being directed to the extremities.
