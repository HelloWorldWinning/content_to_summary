Description:
Okay, here's a summary of the provided text, adhering to your requirements:

**I. Outlined Summary:**

1.  **Core Question & Thesis:**
    *   The text explores why Chinese people seem prone to harming and exploiting each other, citing deep-seated cultural and psychological factors.
    *   It questions if people are treated as ends or merely as tools.

2.  **Chinese vs. Western Cultural Values:**
    *   **Western (Christian) Perspective:**
        *   Individuals are seen as having souls and are responsible to God, existing to save themselves.
        *   People are treated as both a means and an end, with an emphasis on individual autonomy and boundaries.
    *   **Chinese Perspective:**
        *   People are often viewed as tools to serve others or as a means to an end.
        *   Emphasis on relationships and mutual obligation rather than individual worth.
        *   Lack of transcendent values and individual definition outside of social relationships.

3. **The "Tool" Mentality:**
     * Chinese culture encourages viewing individuals as tools within reciprocal relationships.
      *   Parents raise children for old-age support, and children support parents, highlighting a transactional approach.
      *   Emotions and sincerity exist, but are often intertwined with self-interest and expectation of return.

4. **Emotional Manipulation & Lack of Boundaries:**
    *   Chinese culture is deeply rooted in emotional connection ("Heart culture"), leading to blurred boundaries between genuine and insincere interactions.
    *   Friendships are often intertwined with perceived benefits, where the strong provide emotional care, while the dependent accept it, and may confuse it with friendship.
    *   Even seemingly selfless actions often carry an underlying motivation for self-promotion or establishing moral superiority.
     *  This often leads to situations where favors are given with the expectation of future repayment, blurring justice and benefit.
    * The lack of clear personal boundaries often leads to people being viewed as tools for each other, and this can be seen even in business relationships.
    * The Chinese are adept at using emotional connections to manipulate others, targeting the emotional (middle brain) instead of logical (left brain) processing.

5.  **Deep City and Distrust:**
     *    Chinese culture emphasizes emotional connection, which while creating strong social bonds also leads to distrust and deep-rooted "city".
      *   People often don’t reveal their true selves to strangers for fear of manipulation.
    *   This deep "city" is reflected in the fortified structure of China’s past and present, with the Great Wall and the Great Firewall being physical manifestations of this.
      *The core of Chinese society is built on concentric circles of selfishness, where trust decreases the further one moves from the inner circle.
    * This reinforces a sense that every individual acts as "a small China," building internal walls and external barriers.

**II. Core Point:**

Chinese culture, deeply rooted in relational interdependence and a lack of transcendent values, tends to view individuals as tools rather than ends, which fuels exploitation, emotional manipulation, and distrust within society.

**III. Fundamental Point:**

The fundamental difference lies in whether a culture emphasizes individual worth and boundaries (Western) or reciprocal obligations and interdependence (Chinese), which leads to contrasting ways of relating to one another.

**IV. Overarching Framework:**

The overarching framework is a comparison between Western individualistic (soul-centric, purpose-driven) culture and the Chinese relational, interdependent (body-centric, tool-driven) culture, emphasizing the impact of these different value systems on interpersonal relationships.

Why do Chinese people like to harm and exploit each other? Why do most of the Chinese people have very deep cities? China built the Great Wall in ancient times, and in the Internet era, we are still building national firewalls. What are the deep cultural and psychological factors in this? Today we continue to read the book The Deep Structure of Chinese Culture. Today's reading There are answers to the above questions in the chapter. Today I read the topic of Are People Tools or Purposes? If you want to listen to more content, you can subscribe to the YouTube channel. After reading this book, I will read more books on the topic of detoxifying Chinese culture to help myself. Kill the Chinese cultural virus in your mind and achieve cultural exodus at the individual level. Let’s jump to the state of modern civilization as soon as possible. Let’s get started. Are people tools or purposes? Even in situations of caring for each other, Chinese people often do not exclude the factor of taking advantage of each other. Because in the Chinese conscience system, people tend to become tools rather than goals. The philosopher Kant with a Lutheran cultural background said that whether you treat yourself or others, you must treat yourself as an end and not as a tool. Indeed, Western Christian culture It is believed that every individual has a soul, which is a divine being on earth, and that he is only responsible to God. His purpose in the world is only to save himself in nature. Therefore, Westerners tend to treat everyone as a process at the same time. It is also a purpose. However, the Chinese tend to regard everyone as a type and a tool. There is no transcendent factor in the underlying source code of the Chinese. Everyone must use the corresponding relationship between two people to define themselves. In this mutual relationship, The program design defined by the other party also emphasizes that the other party is the priority at all times. In other words, it must be done without self-interest and only to benefit others. In other words, one must use oneself as a tool and others as the purpose. The design of this corresponding relationship naturally requires both parties to do it. This makes it possible for everyone to become each other's tools. Therefore, although Chinese parents and children have emotional factors, the motive of raising children to provide for old age cannot be completely eliminated. Although Chinese filial piety has an element of sincerity, it cannot completely eliminate the reality of relying on parents for support. Considering a soulless and body-oriented culture can indeed only lead to this situation. Westerners who are unsympathetic and unsympathetic do not seem to like making friends, especially Americans, who prefer to be alone. They do not seem to care about others, but They do not interfere and have always been accustomed to relying on themselves. They rarely think about how to use others as bargaining chips. They are more wary of being manipulated from the future. If they make a few friends in small quantities, it is mostly based on pure friendship motives and often The humane Chinese people are built on appreciating each other's integrity. They like to make friends and especially like to take care of others and be taken care of by others. This feeling is sincere to a large extent because Chinese culture is a culture rooted in the brain. The Chinese have a middle-level culture of heart that even empathizes with the universe. However, the result of this overflowing of emotions often leads to an unclear state of boundaries between true and false friendships. For example, in ancient times, slave owners called slaves guests, but later on, the relationship between landlords and tenant farmers Room is also regarded as a relationship between master and client. Even in modern times, people who rent a house to others are still likened to the proprietor who entertains guests, and people who rent other people's houses are still likened to the guests being entertained. This is similar to the English landlord and tenant. The names are also derived from the titles of landlords and tenants in the feudal era. The former means the owner of the property, while the latter means the holder of the right to use it. Therefore, it is a completely cold legal relationship, unlike why it is necessary to say "profit". The Chinese, who are just benevolent and righteous, are so humane. In fact, in the grammatical relationship of the deep structure of Chinese culture, this kind of promiscuity of emotions is similar to the style of extolling unity and selflessness into the sky. Since the Chinese can use unity to Struggles can also use the public to benefit one 's own interests, so there is also a tendency to turn friends into tools. In daily interactions, a person who is not self-interested, only benefits others, and always takes care of others. Of course, it cannot be said that he is not sincere, but it cannot be completely ruled out that he wants to establish himself. The motive of moral superiority, for example, when Chinese people rush to pay after eating in a restaurant, it is not a gesture of belittling oneself, but an act of promoting oneself. Although this is harmless, because in the Chinese programming of two people defining one person, one person It is impossible to stand completely on one's own footing to elevate an individual. He can only do so by stepping on the collective. The only way to do it is to obliterate yourself first. This is what Lao Tzu said. The opposite is the way of the weak. Therefore, it is easy to have the style of asking others to owe you a favor by giving first. Now that you have become a creditor, you can mobilize the other party to do things for you in the future. Indeed, some Chinese people will clearly say that they will help you after helping others. I won’t help you in vain. You have to repay me in the future. Even if the other party is unable to repay me, at least let him be grateful to me. Therefore, the boundary between justice and benefit has never been clear to the Chinese. However, within the scope of friendship, the intention of money transactions can also appear. As for the necessity, People who are often cared for by others are mostly weakened individuals. They tend to confuse dependence with friendship. They must make friends because they need to be with others emotionally or because they hope that even their own affairs will be handled by others. We are not saying that this is how Chinese people make friends. We are just saying that in this culture of the heart, everything is emotionalized. Therefore, even the world outside of pure friendship is also emotionalized. Chinese people tend to treat anyone and anything. Everything is given a layer of human touch, so even profit-seeking behavior must first involve friendship. This tendency certainly exists between individuals and between companies. In China's overly physical culture, only a few people can make friends. It is rare for a soul to contact you, but most of them are to help you settle down and live a life. Sometimes even marriage is the same. In the eyes of Westerners, this kind of care for others is for purposes other than friendship. Therefore, it is always suspected of manipulating others. Such a method of subverting other people's underlying source code is obviously not to appeal to the other party's ability to think rationally and criticize, which is the function of the left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex, but to attack the heart, that is, to attack the middle layer of the brain, which is the animal emotion that is well developed in mammals. Therefore, there is a suspicion of using emotions to control others. Nietzsche's point of view can well represent this kind of vigilance. Whenever there is an occasion for sacrificial service and a benevolent vision, there is also a desire to dominate the will of others, where the weak sneak in along secret paths. The castle even enters the heart of the strongest and gains power - "Thus Spoke Zarathustra". This is obviously the philosophy of the left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex. However, if you look at the above-mentioned leftist united front method from a Western perspective, it is wrong. It's fair because what Nietzsche refers to as the weak is the way to subvert the strong. However, in China's feminine culture, only those who can give more emotions are truly strong. Therefore, there is a phenomenon that the benevolent are invincible. For those who often need to be taken care of emotionally. For the Chinese, it cannot be said to be subverted because they do not have individual needs but want to be with others, and the friendship of others is naturally undesirable. As for their own conscience, its content is also redundant, as Wang Yangming defined it, so it is a Things that cannot be handed over. As for those who use emotional methods to convert other people's hearts, such as the activists in the patriotic movement of overseas students, they themselves do not have to think in terms of middle-level thinking. Therefore, if they use their own hearts to connect with the hearts of others, It is only natural to have a common heart for the motherland. In this sense, it cannot be said to control and manipulate. The Chinese have a tendency to use human relations to serve purposes other than friendship. Naturally, such purposes are not limited to the above-mentioned selflessness. Patriotism or classism can also be the selfishness of some people. This is why Westerners, who have strong self-boundaries produced by the Protestant culture, rarely use any city government and advocate that the boundaries of employment and self are not clear when they strongly advocate individualism. The Chinese, however, use a harmonious approach to achieve peace and harmony. On the contrary, they are very deep-rooted and often advocate the need to be on guard against others. Americans, on the other hand, are known for their naivety. They are not afraid to tell you all their details at once. Because they rarely think of using others as bargaining chips, they naturally don’t expect others to do this to them. If they encounter the latter situation, their strong self-boundary will automatically recall the defensive function so that they are not afraid to say no to others because They don't need to be a human being but emphasize that they must be a human being. Therefore, there is no fearful pressure from people to say that they cannot be a human being. Although the Chinese people engage in "I am you" and "you are me", the result is that they often get stuck step by step. Chinese people rarely reveal their true identity to people they are not familiar with, lest the other party keep a file in their mind and then do some actions to cater to you in order to achieve their own goals in a way of taking before giving. Without the posture of harmony, we cannot get rid of the shame of being a human being. This phenomenon can only be deep in the city. This phenomenon is the same as the phenomenon of fortification at every level in China, a unified world with unclear boundaries between the central and local areas. In fact, every level is a manifestation of the deep structure of culture. In ancient times, every stronghold with city walls was a country. Therefore, the Chinese character "guo" has the image of being surrounded. In a certain sense, every city is very deep. The Chinese are all a small China and use their selfishness as the basis to draw concentric circles and create small circles according to the level of life. China is a big circle. Although we say that we have friends all over the world, we use the world's largest wall to separate ourselves from the outside world. In ancient times, it was the Great Wall. Today, it is the Great Firewall.
