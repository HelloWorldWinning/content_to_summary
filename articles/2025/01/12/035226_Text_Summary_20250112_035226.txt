Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   The rise of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) necessitates accurate forecasting models for future power outputs.
    *   Developing individual models for each DSG is not economically feasible due to the large number of DSGs and a lack of historical data.

2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Adapt the attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model, named Solar TFT (STFT), to 188 real-world operational DSG datasets.
    *   This validates the generalizability of the self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting.

3.  **Results:**
    *   STFT significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to the persistence model and a long short-term memory (LSTM) model for unseen DSGs.
    *   Improvements are 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively.
    *   Improvements are 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% over the LSTM model at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively.

4.  **Considerations:**
    *   STFT's model architecture is more complex, and it has higher computational costs compared to simpler models, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.
    *   STFT shows particular advantages in high-variability periods, particularly during weather transitions, where simpler models struggle with lagged predictions.

5.  **Core Point:** The Solar TFT (STFT) model, adapted from the Temporal Fusion Transformer, offers superior forecasting accuracy for unseen distributed solar generation (DSG) sites, especially in volatile conditions, though it requires higher computational resources.

6.  **Fundamental Point:** The application of attention-based mechanisms, as exemplified by the STFT model, demonstrates a path forward for accurate and generalizable forecasting of distributed renewable energy resources, even with limited historical data.

7.  **Overarching Framework:** The content explores the problem of forecasting power outputs for numerous small-scale, distributed solar generators and proposes a solution using a deep learning model, the Solar Temporal Fusion Transformer (STFT), which leverages the self-attention mechanism to improve multi-step time series forecasting accuracy. This framework addresses challenges such as limited historical data and the need for generalization across unseen DSG sites. The evaluation considers both accuracy and computational trade-offs, along with analyzing the performance of different weather conditions.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
