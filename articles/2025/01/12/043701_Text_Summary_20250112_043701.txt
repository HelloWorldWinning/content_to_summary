Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Core Ideas:**

*   **Challenge:** Predicting power output for numerous small-scale urban Distributed Solar Generation (DSG) sites with limited historical data, making individual models for each DSG impractical.
*   **Solution:** Adapting the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model, specifically a Solar TFT (STFT), to forecast power output for unseen DSGs.
*   **Methodology:** Applying the STFT model, leveraging the self-attention mechanism, to 188 real-world operational DSG datasets.
*   **Results:**
    *   STFT significantly outperforms the persistence model in 10, 20, and 30-minute forecasts.
    *   STFT shows improved forecast accuracy over Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models in 10, 20, and 30-minute forecasts.
    *   STFT excels during periods of high variability, especially during weather transitions.
*   **Trade-off:** STFT has higher computational cost than other deep learning models.
*   **Weather Analysis:** The performance of STFT was analyzed under clear, partly cloudy, and overcast conditions, highlighting its strength during weather transitions.

**II. Conclusions:**

*   **Core Point:**  The proposed STFT model, adapted from the attention-based temporal fusion transformer, demonstrates strong generalization capabilities in forecasting power outputs for unseen distributed solar generation sites, outperforming persistence and LSTM models, especially under conditions of high variability.
*   **Fundamental Point:** The self-attention mechanism within the Temporal Fusion Transformer proves to be highly effective in handling complex time series data for solar generation, even when historical data is limited, suggesting a shift towards more generalizable forecasting methods.

**III. Overarching Framework:**

This research is framed around the challenge of forecasting solar power generation in a distributed network, where individual modeling is not feasible. The study leverages a sophisticated time-series model (STFT) with an aim to improve accuracy and generalizability when dealing with unseen datasets and variable weather conditions, with a trade-off in computational complexity.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
