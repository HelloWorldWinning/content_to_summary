Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Problem Statement:**
   * The rise of small-scale urban Distributed Solar Generation (DSG) necessitates accurate forecasting for unseen DSGs.
   * Traditional individual models for each DSG are not economically feasible due to a lack of historical data and numerous DSGs.

**II. Proposed Solution:**
   * Adapt the attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model for DSG power output forecasting.
   * The proposed Solar TFT (STFT) model leverages the self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting.
   * Validation uses 188 real-world operational DSG datasets.

**III. Experimental Results:**
   * STFT outperforms the persistence model by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively, when applied to unseen DSGs without training data.
   * STFT demonstrates enhanced forecast accuracy compared to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, with improvements of 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute horizons, respectively.
   * STFT exhibits particularly strong performance during high-variability and weather transition periods compared to other models, where other models often experience time lag and larger errors.

**IV. Considerations:**
   * STFT has a more complex architecture and higher computational cost than other models.
   * A trade-off exists between accuracy and computational efficiency.
   * The forecast performance is analyzed under clear, partly cloudy, and overcast weather conditions.

**Core Point:** The self-attention mechanism in the adapted Solar TFT (STFT) model effectively improves the accuracy of multi-step time series forecasting for unseen distributed solar generation (DSG), showcasing its potential for real-world applications.

**Fundamental Point:**  The need for site-adaptive forecasting models for urban distributed solar generation is addressed by the STFT's enhanced generalizability and accuracy, particularly during periods of high variability and weather transitions.

**Overarching Framework:**
This research uses data-driven approaches to address a forecasting problem. It highlights the need to move away from single-model approaches for each instance of renewable energy generation and considers the trade off between accuracy and computational complexity in the context of a deep learning application.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
