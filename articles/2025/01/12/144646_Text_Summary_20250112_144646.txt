Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   The concept of Smart Buildings was introduced by the Energy Performance Building Directive to promote energy efficiency and user engagement.
    *   Definitions of smart buildings vary in literature, lacking a unified understanding.
    *   Building energy retrofit is crucial for achieving nearly Zero-Energy Building (nZEB) targets.
    *   A large portion of existing buildings will still be in use by 2050, necessitating upgrades.

2.  **Smart Retrofitting:**
    *   Existing retrofitting strategies must evolve into Smart Retrofitting to meet nZEB goals.
    *   Smart retrofitting should enable buildings to respond to dynamic external conditions (weather, grid).
    *   The research aims to define smartness in buildings, identify features and technologies.
    *   The research also explores challenges for smart retrofit applications.

3.  **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    *   The research reviews existing KPIs for evaluating smart building performance.
    *   A need for quantified guidelines is identified to improve energy and technology innovation.
    *   Nine groups of performance indicators are developed as a result.
    *   The work highlights existing literature gaps and future research possibilities.

4.  **Core Point:** The development of a quantified approach for smart retrofitting, supported by performance indicators, is crucial for transitioning existing buildings towards nearly Zero-Energy status while addressing dynamic external factors.

5.  **Fundamental Point:**  The integration of smart technologies into building retrofitting is essential to improve energy efficiency and adaptability of buildings and achieve long-term sustainability goals, especially considering the large existing building stock.

6.  **Overarching Framework:**
    *   **Problem:** Inconsistent definitions and lack of quantifiable guidelines for smart buildings and retrofitting.
    *   **Solution:** Review existing concepts and develop a structured set of KPIs and framework for smart building retrofitting.
    *   **Goal:** Achieving nZEB targets and increased energy flexibility by enabling buildings to respond to dynamic conditions.

Content:
The concept of Smart Buildings was introduced by the Energy Performance Building Directive, with the aim to promote energy flexibility, renewable energy production and user interaction. A wide range of definitions have been introduced in the literature to characterize smart buildings yet, at present, its' concept and features are not clearly and uniquely defined. Simultaneously, building energy retrofit concept has been introduced to facilitate achieving the nearly Zero-Energy Building target and reduce energy consumption in existing buildings. Up to 90 % of the existing European building stock will still be standing and in use in 2050. Thus, there is a need to upgrade the existing retrofitting strategies into Smart Retrofitting, to achieve the nearly Zero Energy Building target and be able to respond to external dynamic conditions such as the weather and the grid. The aim of this research is first to review the concept of smartness in the built environment, highlighting the main features, functions, and technologies of smart buildings, also discussing the possible challenges for smart retrofit applications. The second part of the paper reviews the existing Key Performance Indicators that measure the performance and success in achieving goals in smart buildings. The need to develop a quantified guideline to improve energy and technological innovation is the basis for the increase of the smartness in buildings. Consequently, a set of nine groups of representative performance indicators for smart buildings is developed. This work shows current gaps in the literature and highlights the space for foreseeable future research.
