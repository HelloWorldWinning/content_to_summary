Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Problem:**

*   The rise of small-scale distributed solar generation (DSG) necessitates accurate forecasting models.
*   Traditional approaches of creating individual models for each DSG are not cost-effective due to the sheer number and lack of historical data.
*   The challenge is to develop a model that can generalize well to unseen DSGs without specific training data.

**II. Proposed Solution:**

*   Adapt the attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model, named Solar TFT (STFT), to real-world DSG data.
*   Validate the generalizability of the self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting.

**III. Experimental Results:**

*   STFT improves significantly compared to the persistence model (11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% improvements at 10, 20, and 30-minute forecasts).
*   STFT outperforms representative deep learning models, such as LSTM, (3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at 10, 20, and 30-minute forecasts).
*   STFT demonstrates robustness in high-variability periods and weather transition periods where other models lag.
*   Higher computational cost is associated with the more complex model architecture of STFT compared to other models.

**IV. Considerations:**

*   There is a trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational efficiency that must be considered in practical applications.
*   The study considers the performance of the model in clear, partly cloudy, and overcast weather conditions.

**Core Point:** The study demonstrates that the Solar TFT (STFT) model, leveraging the self-attention mechanism of TFT, can provide accurate multi-step forecasts for unseen distributed solar generation (DSG) units, outperforming conventional and deep learning models.

**Fundamental Point:**  The effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms in handling temporal dependencies allows for a generalized forecasting model suitable for numerous DSG units, even in the absence of training data.

**Overarching Framework:** The framework involves leveraging a novel model (STFT) based on attention mechanisms to address the practical challenge of forecasting in numerous distributed solar generation systems with limited historical data, validating its generalizability and comparing it against standard benchmark models.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
