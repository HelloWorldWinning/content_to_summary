Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Core Idea:**
    *   The artist used a camera attached to a chain, recording movements as a "vaginal engine".
    *   The recorded movements show the shifting of "red areas" within the body.
    *   Initially concentrated internally, the "red areas" move towards the lower body.
    *   The extremities (legs, feet, hands, and head) become prominently red.

2.  **Core Point:** The artwork visualizes a dynamic shift of internal energy, represented by "red areas," from the core to the extremities of the body through movement.

3.  **Fundamental Point:** The piece explores the relationship between movement, internal energy, and the manifestation of that energy in the physical body.

4.  **Overarching Framework:** The framework is based on an artistic exploration of bodily movement as a means to redistribute internal energy, which is visually represented by the changing concentration of a red visual element within a body.

Content:
 The artist recorded every movement as a vaginal engine using a chain for red camera. It's clear that from the shaking the head and, wagging the tail to dispel hard fire, the red areas originally, concentrated in the internal organs, gradually sink to the lower body. The lower legs and feet become warmer. The hands, feet and head of pure red, as key and blood being directed to the extremities.
