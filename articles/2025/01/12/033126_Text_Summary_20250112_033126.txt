Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   Small-scale distributed solar generation (DSG) is increasing in urban areas.
    *   Accurate forecasting models are needed for these DSGs.
    *   It's not feasible to train individual models for each DSG due to lack of historical data.
2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Adapt the attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model.
    *   The adapted model is named Solar TFT (STFT).
    *   Validate the generalizability of self-attention for multi-step forecasting on 188 real-world operational DSG data.
3.  **Results:**
    *   STFT improves over the persistence model by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% for 10, 20, and 30-minute forecasts when adapted to unseen DSGs without training data.
    *   STFT outperforms a long short-term memory (LSTM) model by 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% for the same forecast horizons.
    *   STFT performs especially well during weather transitions.
4.  **Considerations:**
    *   STFT has higher computational costs and complexity compared to other deep learning models, such as LSTM.

**Core Point:**

The Solar Temporal Fusion Transformer (STFT) model, leveraging the self-attention mechanism, demonstrates superior forecasting accuracy for unseen distributed solar generation systems, particularly during high variability periods.

**Fundamental Point:**

Adapting advanced machine learning models like TFT to leverage self-attention can achieve significantly more accurate and generalizable solar power forecasts across diverse and unseen installations compared to conventional or simpler models, even under limited data conditions.

**Overarching Framework:**

The study explores the adaptation of a temporal fusion transformer model for multi-step time series forecasting in the context of distributed solar generation, focusing on enhancing forecast accuracy for unseen sites with limited data, and ultimately, demonstrates the effectiveness of self-attention based modeling.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
