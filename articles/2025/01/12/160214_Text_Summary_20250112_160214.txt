Abstract: Ensemble learning methods have gained significant attention in the realm of stock - market prediction due to their ability to
combine multiple models for enhanced accuracy and robustness. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various
ensemble learning techniques, including bagging, boosting, and stacking, applied to the task of predicting stock - market movements. Our
evaluation encompasses a diverse set of financial markets and time periods, considering both traditional machine learning algorithms
and deep learning architectures as base models. We systematically compare the performance of ensemble methods against individual
models and benchmark strategies, utilizing a range of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 - score. Additionally,
we investigate the impact of ensemble size, diversity of base models, and ensemble composition on predictive performance. Our findings
provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and practical considerations of ensemble learning for stock - market prediction, offering
guidance for researchers and practitioners in the field of financial forecasting.
