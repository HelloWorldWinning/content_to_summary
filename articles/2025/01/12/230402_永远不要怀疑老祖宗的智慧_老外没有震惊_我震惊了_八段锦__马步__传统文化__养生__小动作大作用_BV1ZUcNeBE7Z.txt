Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Movement Recording:** The artist documented body movements as if they were generated by a "vaginal engine."
2.  **Red Camera & Chain:** This recording was achieved using a red camera attached by a chain.
3.  **Shifting Heat/Redness:** The heat or red color initially concentrated in the internal organs gradually moves downward.
    *   Head shaking and tail wagging are actions related to the dispersion of the concentrated "hard fire" (or heat).
4.  **Lower Body Warmth:** The lower legs and feet become warmer as the red coloration shifts.
5.  **Extremities as Focus:** Ultimately, the hands, feet, and head, turning a pure red, become the focus, which implies a concentration of blood or energy flow to these extremities.

**Core Point:** The artistic performance visualizes a shift of internal heat/energy from the core to the extremities, expressed through movement and color change.

**Fundamental Point:** The artwork explores the concept of internal energy flow and its manifestation through physical movement, visualized by changes in color concentration, thus creating a symbolic connection between the body and its internal workings.

**Overarching Framework:** The overarching framework is a **physical and metaphorical journey of energy/heat distribution within the body, visualized through art as movement, color, and a symbolic "vaginal engine".**

Content:
 The artist recorded every movement as a vaginal engine using a chain for red camera. It's clear that from the shaking the head and, wagging the tail to dispel hard fire, the red areas originally, concentrated in the internal organs, gradually sink to the lower body. The lower legs and feet become warmer. The hands, feet and head of pure red, as key and blood being directed to the extremities.
