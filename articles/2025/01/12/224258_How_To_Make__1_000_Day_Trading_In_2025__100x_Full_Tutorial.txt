Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   The video introduces a day trading strategy aimed at finding multiple $1,000+ opportunities daily.
    *   The strategy emphasizes mastering a few key concepts rather than relying on numerous indicators or luck.
    *   The goal is to show viewers how to start with little or no money and apply the framework.

2.  **Charting Basics and Trends:**
    *   Understanding trends is crucial for the trading model.
    *   Trends are identified by higher highs and higher lows in uptrends and lower highs and lower lows in downtrends.
    *   A "break of structure" confirms the continuation of a trend.
    *   Trendlines are used to predict potential price points and continuations of the trend.
    *   Change of character is a key term, indicating when a fundamental rule of a trend is broken, which often suggests a trend reversal.
    *   Underside and overside retests are critical contact points before a significant directional change.

3.  **Elliot Wave Theory:**
    *   Trends often develop in five-wave structures followed by a corrective ABC wave.
    *   Rules for identifying Elliot waves: wave two cannot exceed the bottom of wave one, wave four cannot go below the high of wave one, and the rule of alternation for corrective waves.
    *   Fibonacci extension tool is used to predict where wave five might end, often at the 1.618 multiple of wave one.
    *   Combining Elliot Wave theory with trend lines allows one to time tops and bottoms more effectively.

4.  **Risk Management & Position Sizing:**
    *   The video emphasizes that trading success lies in risk management and position sizing, more than technical analysis.
    *   The concept of "R factor" (risk reward ratio) is introduced: making more when right than losing when wrong.
    *   Maintaining uniform dollar risk is critical for any trading strategy.
    *   The quantity of units to buy is determined by the dollar amount to risk divided by the difference between the entry price and stop-loss price.
    *   Trading math matters, not being right all the time.

5.  **Statistical Probability and the Central Limit Theorem:**
    *   The central limit theorem requires a sample size of at least 30 trades to get accurate averages.
    *   Focus should shift from potential profit per trade to following trading rules to determine a winning percentage.
    *   The importance of data collection and backtesting for making accurate predictions and consistently profitable trades.
    *   The need to follow a process and ensure proof of concept for one's trading model.

6.  **Entry Model:**
    *   The trading model consists of these steps:
        *   Identify a trend.
        *   Find indications of a reversal using price channels, trend breaks, retests, and Elliot Wave Theory.
        *   Wait for a "change of character" in a reversal-prone area.
        *   Enter at the midpoint of a fair value gap (FVG).
        *   The stop loss is placed under the candle producing the FVG.
    *   Fair value gaps (FVGs) are areas of imbalance in price, used for entry points.
    *   The stop loss is moved to break even once a break of structure is confirmed, then the trade is trailed to an important FVG on a higher time frame.
    *   The goal is to let massive trends play out while reducing risk and locking in profits.

7.  **Scaling and Practice:**
    *   A trading journal is used to track trades and data to determine average winning percentages.
    *   Trading View can be used with a fair value gap indicator and step-by-step forward play to test the strategy in real time.
    *   A script was created with AI to simulate potential returns based on win rates and risk factors.

8. **Conclusion**

*   **Core Point:** This strategy focuses on identifying trends, anticipating reversals, entering at optimal points, and using effective risk management to achieve profitability.
*   **Fundamental Point:** Consistent risk management, following a trading plan, and focusing on risk reward ratios are more crucial than being right on every trade for long term profitability.

9.  **Overarching Framework:**
    The content presents a structured approach to trading, moving from understanding market trends and chart analysis, through to risk management and trade execution. The framework comprises of:
    *   **Market Analysis:** Using charting techniques and theories like Elliot Waves to assess trends and potential reversal points.
    *   **Risk Management:** Calculating risk reward ratios and implementing stop loss strategies to protect capital.
    *   **Trade Execution:** Identifying key entry points through fair value gaps, and scaling profits through risk reduction techniques.
    *   **Data Analysis:** Collecting and analyzing historical data to refine strategy and improve probability of profitability.

ladies and gentlemen you're in for quite the treat because whether you're coming into this video with some experience or you're brand new looking for a way to start trading I'm going to show you exactly what I do on a daily basis to be able to find $1, 000 plus trade opportunities multiple times per day which often allows me to be able to make $3 $4, 000 in a single session risking $500 alongside our ever growing team that are doing things like 25 Xing their risk on some of their trades growing their accounts multiple x's in a really short amount of time doing things like 70 trade win streaks using the exact Frameworks that I'm going to be sharing with you today and this isn't because we're using a million different indicators we trying to get lucky with news or following some Voodoo ICT concept this is because we've mastered a few simple Concepts to be able to enter the market in key areas and profit off of following Trends by trading this one simple strategy that gives us these multiple thousand plus dollar opportunities several times per day so in this video not only am I going to share with you the framework of this strategy but I'm also going to show you what the process should look like starting with a small amount of money or even no money I'm going to show you a ton of examples of me doing this live so you'll have this framework and hopefully be able to learn from and apply it to your own trading my goal on this channel and the reason why we're growing at the rate that we are is because I always want to prioritize value to you guys with an option to advance it further while keeping it fair to the private side but providing value to everyone all right that's exactly what we're going to do in today's video so let's dive in all right so before we dive into the actual strategy itself I'm going to show you some key simple charting Basics that are going to show you how I look at the market overall and by the way in this video I'm going to start basic and be able to take you to fairly Advanced even if you know very little or nothing about trading right now so if by the end of the video I was right make sure you hit hit the like button and let me know in the comments in order to trade this model we have to understand what we're trying to achieve overall the first thing that we have to do is understand Trends themselves so anytime the market is moving significantly up or significantly down this is happening in the form of Trends we can actually read Trends in a bunch of different ways but of course the overall goal is to be able to find out when these Trends are happening and be able to either enter into the trends as they're moving to then be able to sell it at a higher price for profit or find a previous Trend and be able to anticipate where we think this is going to reverse to be able to enter in at the very beginning of a trend and to be able to make a large amount of money by getting in really early on a trend and making profit as it moves up all right and when we're looking at charts these Trends are going to be represented by groups of these candles so you can see uptrend here downtrend here but in order for us to start really reading Trends accurately we need to understand the characteristics of Trends so that we know when something changes which is going to allow us to get in very early in Trends and be able to have a lot of upside potential so in trading we consider a trend where there is a high a low and then a higher high followed by a higher low but this point can only be confirmed as a higher low if something happens called a break of structure so these breaks of structures is what's going to confirm to us that we either have the potential for the beginning of a new trend as we get our first pushup then once we have a push up a correction another pushup a correction and then a break of structure again then we have our high low higher high and confirmed higher low which checks this off as a trend okay and these details as we're reading Trends are going to become more and more important as we get through the video all right and the reason this is important is because if we know the characteristics of a trend when it stops having those characteristics after there is an uptrend there's either consolidation where price moves sideways or there's a beginning of a new trend in which case if there is a beginning of a new trend in the opposite direction we can position ourselves at the very beginning of that Trend and there's a bunch of different ways to read the current Trend that we're in be able to enter that Trend or predict a new trend and get in at the very bottom all right so I want to show you a few ways that we can predict and sort of evaluate the movement of Trends and then we're going to look on some charts and I'm going to show you some examples all right so the first thing that we can do if we have our first second third point we can actually use trend lines along this high and this high and then dropping that parallel line down to this second point to then be able to predict a possible fourth point and a continuation up into the trend so if we look at an example like this we have a downtrend here where we have movement like this and then it actually breaks out creates a new high Zone here so now we a potential new uptrend which would be our high or low this point is higher than this point so once again if we draw a line from here to here down to this level we have some reason to believe that the price could potentially bounce off of that area before continuing to make a move higher you can see price bounces off of that area before then moving higher all right and so we'll notice with these Trends we sort of see these invisible walls as the price keeps reacting off of these same areas we can draw these trend lines off of when this momentum in a certain area fails to create one of these new break of structures and now produces a lower low now that fundamental rule of an uptrend has been broken and this is something called a change of character and this is a key term to remember for later into the video all right this is important for a few reasons so you'll see as we have these multiple points of contact being created notice how the price contacts this lower Trend once and then quickly once again and then finally has a point where it breaks underneath this line not only is this telling us that there's a potential for an overall shift in momentum okay but often times what we'll see is the price come up and Rec contct the underside of this trend I call these overside or Underside retests in which case this can often times be the last contact point before a massive change in Direction and if we look at this in terms of a trend we could be catching the first dip in the trend before seeing a full continuation in that Trend if we are to see a confirmation in that change in Direction all right there's one final strategy that I use whenever I'm evaluating Trends which is always looking at Trends in regards to something called Elliot wave theory okay bear with me because if you're a beginner this is where it's going to start to sound really confusing but I think I can break it down pretty simply for you in Elliot wave theory for whatever reason there's a natural phenomenon in people's emotion and how Trends tend to develop that causes them to develop in five wave structures where we have a 1 2 3 4 five followed by a corrective move of an a BC okay I have a lot of videos where I dive into this in detail but there's a few critical rules that sort of allow us to be able to justify whether this is an Elliot wave Trend in which case we can really start to use other tools to be able to time perfect tops in reversal points of Trends all right the first first rule that I look for to confirm whether this is an Elliot wave is that the two- wave cannot exceed the bottom of the one wave so in this situation this two level can't go below the start of this cuz obviously that wouldn't constitute as a higher low the second is that the wave four cannot go below the high of wave 1 so technically an Elliot wave this four wave shouldn't really go below this high of one okay what I'm looking for is really to see if there's a reaction off of that level which is once again confirming Elliot wave and the third thing is something called the rule of alternation which basically states that if one of these sort of pullback waves is simple the other one should be complex all right so if the movement of this wave is fairly simple this wave should be fairly weird and complex okay in vice versa if this one is weird and complex this one should be fairly simple so anytime I'm looking at a trend if I have this five wave structure that is following all of these rules if I can count 1 2 3 4 five waves and we're already in the fifth wave I'm already setting myself up on the chart to be in the general area to potentially be looking for some sort of reversal this is where we can wait for a change of character this is where we can wait for Underside retests this is also where I can use a tool that I use in conjunction with Elliot wave theory which basically shows us that if we consider this Wave 1 a factor of one all right there's a tool that we can use to multiply by what's called a Fibonacci golden ratio which is basically this number that for whatever reason everything in the universe and in nature in general is built off of often times the wave five will fall at the 1. 618 multiple of our first wave I know this sounds fairly complicated but if you're using trading view you can go over to your tool in Fibonacci and you can click on this trend based FIB extension and then all you have to do is measure from the bottom to that first push up by clicking at the bottom at the top and then going back down to the bottom all right and that's going to give us the 1618 2618 Etc so if we have all of these rules lining up in addition to them hitting into one of these multiples at the high of wave five obviously this is a drawing so I didn't set it up to work out that way okay so let's say it did for example say my Wave 1 was here if we now have the scenario where we're matching up with one of these multiples this is giving me even further reason to believe if we do have new lower low produced we could be at the very beginning of a brand new trend this is a pretty surface level version I dive way more into this of course on the private side of our trading team but also in other YouTube videos I'll link the technical analysis guide at the end of this video if you want to watch it where I really dive into more advanced concepts but looking at Trends in terms of this with break of structures by counting waves if we're in the general vicinities this is my first step of sort of timing and stting to set up reversals on Trends okay so of course the hard part and this is the part that most people mess up is one thinking that they need to be right all the time and two actually being able to get into the market at the time setting up the positions and understanding the trading math that goes into it okay so now I want to move into a critical mathematical understanding that is going to completely flip the way you think about trading and probably be that a hot light bald moment when it comes to actually getting into the market and setting up positions you're going to need to know this when we start talking about the actual strategy of where I enter the market and why in trading most of the battle is actually the math and position sizing rather than understanding patterns and understanding how to do charting Etc a lot of people know technical analysis but not a lot of people are actually able to be profitable off of it because of what I'm going to show you in just a second okay so in professional trading we use something called r factor and as human beings we have an issue with being wrong and losing money right it's just part of life in trading okay it has nothing to do with being right it's about setting yourself up in the market so that when you are right you're making more than when you're wrong so say for example we have reason to believe that we should be entering the market right here each time you set up a position you have something called a stop- loss which is this red value here and then you have something right here called your take profit and the ratio between these two factors is called your risk reward ratio you can see in this situation if price moves here before moving here I have a risk reward ratio of four meaning I'll make four times as much money if I'm right then if I'm wrong okay so this area right here is what we're going to consider our risk factor okay so if we enter here we have our take profit level right there and our stop- loss value here say we want to risk $50 on this trade in this situation our potential profit would be $197 if we move our stop loss up you can see the potential profit increases significantly but obviously the probability of you timing this exact level and having it go all the way up here before coming down here then statistically becomes less likely okay in vice versa if we make our stop loss a lot wider the statistical probability of us getting a move up here before here becomes obviously bigger bigger you can see now potential profits only $119 but the odds of it happening are higher so of course when we're designing trading systems we're trying to use analysis to set up the most optimal conditions for us to be right as much as we can so that when we are right we're making much more than what we're losing when we're wrong okay we can see a table that shows that threshold of whether you are not profitable your break even or you're profitable but this proves my point if you're able to make three times what you're risking on a single trade and you're able to do that 30% of the the time meaning you're wrong 70% of the time you're still going to be able to be profitable at trading okay if you can make 5x what you're risking and you can do it just over 20% of the time you're still going to be statistically profitable that means that you're wrong 80% of the time all right and that's what really makes this strategy so exciting because you can see this is one of our private team members and as you can see he's working in these risk factors he's not even talking about money and his account is up 800% and he just started about 3 weeks ago with a 52% win rate but notice how a lot of his tra are actually that 1 to5 and that 1: 4 risk reward ratio at a 52% 1: 5 52% is going to be extremely profitable all right and you'll see in a trade that I just took last week that I'm going to review in a second all right I Clos this trade out for about four to five risk factors so once again in this 1 to5 threshold so all you really need is about a 20% win rate in that situation and as we can be more selective about our analysis the goal is to get it up over that and that's what we've been able to do however this is only possible if we're keeping our dollar amount risk uniform each time we take a position because say for example we want to enter a position here so we go ahead and enter with 20 salana right at here all right and we're able to make $229 all right and then say for example we want to enter here with our stop loss here we go ahead and buy with 20 units again this time we're wrong and now instead of risking $50 we're risking $100 still with using the same amount of units okay so we can't be basing it off of a certain unit amount the risk has to be uniform in order for the whole entire trading formula to actually work all right so when we're thinking about trading we should be thinking about it in terms of risk factors or R so in order to create consistent R you want to take the dollar amount that you want to risk you're going to take your entry price minus your stop-loss price and that's going to give you the quantity that you need to buy at your entry in order to risk that certain dollar amount that you want all right if you want this tool that does it right on screen for you on trading View and gives you the whole table go in the description of this video follow me on Instagram DM me the word tools and it's going to be in this entire tool suite for you a on with all of the other stuff that we do on this channel for trading all right but if we look at this example we can do this right in our head where if we take our entry value at 19168 subtract that by our stop- loss value of 186. 65 that'll give us $471 if we take $50 risk divided by 4. 71 that'll give us roughly 10. 6 units in order to risk $50 okay once again if we click on our entry take profit stop loss value we're on a risk $50 you can see that will give us the exact amount of units to enter to keep our risk factor consistent if you don't do that you might as well throw everything else out the window throw out this strategy that I'm going to show you okay you have to keep your risk consistent in trading for everything else to follow through all right the second math concept that I really want you guys to understand and this is a huge psychological one I'm probably going to expand on this in other videos but it's really critical for trading in general before I share with you guys the entry model and this has to do with statistical probability which that's what trading is each time you take a position there's a certain percent chance of it going right versus it going wrong and how much money you're expected to make when it does in order for us to know what your average gain or loss is on a trade or the winning percentage we need to follow the same exact process and allow something called the central limit theorem to unfold if you're new and this sounds confusing stick with me I know I can explain it to you say for example we're flipping a coin all right everyone knows there's heads and tails and there's a 50% chance of either getting heads or getting Tails everyone is confident that over time that percentage is what happens but I could sit here and flip heads heads and heads three times in a row but just to sort of go to my point even though we all can agree that statistically we're going to get each outcome 50% of the time in statistics you need a sample size of at least 30 based on the central limit theorem in order to actually get your averages over time so what a lot of times people do when they start trading is they'll take a few trades and then they'll start running all the numbers oh if I can only do this every single day I'll be rich by then or d d and it's just like you have to understand a bell curve distribution and what the bell curve is going to do is it's going to actually give us the average over a certain data set which in this case is your trades you need to let your trades unfold and you need to say what percentage of the time am I right and how much money am I making when I am right okay and once you have that sample size of 30 then you can determine whether you're going to move into using real funds and things like that okay and this sort of shifts the perspective of how much money can I make on each trade to how closely can I follow my trading rules that we're going to get to in a second here with my own data to be able to know what my actual winning percentage and average average risk reward is per trade okay and with me doing that on the chart with doing my analysis where does that put me on this chart okay we've actually done this over thousands of data points we put together a whole back testing team okay we have all sorts of examples of this strategy I believe in testing we ended up with an over four expectancy which brings us over into this green area okay if anyone's telling you that they're over here they're probably lying to you it's almost near impossible to be there you're really going to be in trading right on this line and it's a very subtle difference between making money or not trading that's why you have to be really consistent that's why you have to keep your risk uniform that's why you have to follow your rules you have to test that's why it's so important to not over complicate things but follow a repeatable process and really make sure that you have that proof of concept in your model know it works and that's sort of what I'm talking about with you guys being able to test this out for yourselves before you're even investing money into it further a lot of people on YouTube just want deposits they want people to start spending money immediately that's not how I am I spent years mastering this and all I'm doing is boiling it down into more digestible process for you guys so that you can speed up your progress over time and there's a lot of team members that are learning three four weeks and being able to start this process that took me years and years just because I'm boiling it down into a way more digestible form doesn't have to be that complicated but you have to be strict and you have to treat it like a business all right so now using all of the things that we've learned so far let's start applying this to the actual trading strategy our entry model where specifically I enter on these Trends to be able to allow these really nice trades to play out for this entry system what I'm first doing is finding and identifying a trend okay and what we're doing with this system is we're finding a trend we're waiting for it to hopefully end show signs of reversals and then trying to build a position to trade the very beginning of a new trend okay so Step One is finding a trend step two is is finding some sort of indication of a reversal okay so we talked about price channels we talked about Trend breaks okay we talked about Trend break retests and we talked about predicting highs with Elliot wave okay also you can use things like RS we have an inevit trade Pro Plus indicator which is once again in that tool Suite if you're interested that will give you these highlights strips of points in the market where we have these significant pushes that often time lead to these reversal points you can see dip here dip here that was almost the exact bottom before the trend all right and on the private side of our team we actually ran analysis with a ton of different indicators to be able to come up with a custom indicator that will give us ripe environments for potential reversals that in conjunction with other things will tell us whether or not to actually consider these as real reversal points all right this is where it gets somewhat technical so remember what we were talking about with the change of character on Trends step three is going to be waiting for for a change of character in a reversal prone area all right so if we're looking at this on a chart we found our downtrend here Second Step we're finding a reversal indication we have our change of character right here all right in step four this is where we're going to be entering at something called a fair value Gap all right and if you're new to trading I'm going to explain a fair value Gap to you basically if we take one two three candles here in a bullish direction we're going to take the wick of this candle to the wick of the third candle and the space in between here is what's called a bullish fair value Gap all right in this situation where we have 1 2 three bearish candles if we go from the low of this Wick to the high of this Wick this is also a bearish fair value Gap and what we're doing in this model is we're waiting for that reversal indication and then we're finding this midpoint between that fair value Gap and at the midpoint this is where I'm entering in at the markets and our stop-loss value is being put underneath the fair value Gap producing candle okay so stop under the candle that produced the fair value Gap all right so if we're looking at this situation here this candle here that sort of caused this displacement has left a gap in between here so now we know we've had a major push out of this current Trend so if we do get a pull back down into this Zone all right these fair value gaps are often areas where the price will bounce off and then take a continuation okay you can see in this situation this would be where we place our position price comes up pushes back down into the midpoint of the fair value Gap and gets us into the trade and one of the most important things that you can do in trading is starting to reduce risk as the trade goes into your direction you get initial reaction you want to take risk off the table at a place where it makes sense so that now you can only make money and you no longer are risking any of your capital okay so once a break of structure like we learned about in a trend a continuation of the new trend that we're now in on is confirmed as a candle closes Above This previous High okay so this would be our high okay now that we have a candle closing above that high we would move our stop loss flat so now we can't lose any money and now we're letting the trade run in our Direction okay but you can see off of our initial risk we're already up 3. 55 risk factors on this trade all right and the goal with this is to allow these massive Trends to really play out so it's either that this trend continues to move down then I take my -1 r or the trade moves crazy in my direction now I'm reducing risk and then what I'm doing is we're basically waiting for a 1 to four risk reward ratio to hit and then I'm going out into a larger time frame cuz we're trading this on a 1 minute frequency so each candle represents one minute worth of price movement I'll go down into something like a 5 minute time frame and then I'll try to find an important fair value gap on the opposite side of the trend so notice how that the midpoint point of this fair value Gap is right here at this red line now in this situation I would be fairly comfortable allowing this red line to be hit all right and then all I'm doing is trailing the second fair value Gap all right so as we get a push I'll bring my stop loss up to here all right so then my stop loss is going to go up to this second fair value Gap all right and then it finally gets stopped out in the money for 8. 8 risk factors on this specific example all right this is obviously bar replay but you can see dc22 8. 3 risk reward on smog you can see his entry was down here take profit profit was all the way up here 7. 2 risk factor again Robin with the 25 risk reward all right so let's take a look at me setting this trade up in real time so I identified my Trend I placed my stop loss here with my entry at my midpoint of my fair value Gap okay this indicator right here is a proprietary indicator that we have used with all of our data testing we had a bunch of different indicators and we figured out when to actually take these fair value gaps seriously which allowed us to drastically increase our winning percentage we had a sell indicator right here so I took the fair value Gap as an entry I'm up about $400 on this position okay and watch How I manage this trade okay so you'll see I didn't reduce my risk yet okay because you'll notice this candle didn't close below this level so our rule number three didn't come to fruition notice how we get a change of character here all right so then I went in and adjusted my stop loss back to the entry okay I was noticing pretty key support levels here on this chart so I took this trade off the table for about $2, 000 in profit all right here's another example of me doing this so I have my Trend here I've identified my sell signal we have our fair value Gap with h change of character I enter the position this time the stop loss was outside the high here cuz it was a little tight in general all right I wait for a change of character to go underneath this low I reduce my risk down to zero okay I wait for a fair value gap on the overall trend here all right I was up about 222300 and I just wanted to be done with the trade I made five risk factors so I closed out my trade in this area of support all right here's another trade example okay so we have our sell indication I tap into the midpoint of the fair value Gap stop loss over this candle price breaks down through that level I set my stop loss to zero I'm targeting this as my first key area of support this trade was a little bit annoying so price comes down tags that perfect level that we have drawn out I'm up $2, 000 and watch how fast this flipped this is the reality of trading so price vacuums off of that level comes straight up and tags my trade out for break even all right and then the price continue to just go way past that point but that's just to show you why we do what we do if we have the trend moving in our direction we don't want to lose a full amount of money because we're looking to trade Trend reversals all right so here's another trade setup that we have look I'm geared up to try to make about $3, 500 we have my change of character okay price comes up and fills me through here but notice how my overside retest is right where my stop- loss was placed I started to get concerns that this was going to come up hit my stop loss okay so I ended up taking this trade still trade went up against me all right and so I locked in my negative one risk factor so once again the goal isn't to not lose trades it's about containing those losses and keeping those losses small and letting all my winners be $2, 500 $3, 000 multiple times per day you take5 $5500 hits and all you're aiming to do is be on this side of the chart all right so now let's talk about scaling this and what this is going to look like as you start to put this into practice all right so I actually built out a tool for you once again it's in that tool Suite if you follow me on Instagram and DM me tools I'll send it over to you but this is my personal trading desk where I basically Journal all of the trades that I take I have all of my criteria here I have my daily checklist here and my total Equity curve so this is just an example of what you can do but what you should be doing is testing this model out for yourself inputting your p&l in your win or loss rate which is going to give you your average winning percentage all right and then we just filter for win we can see our average risk reward if we're risking $10 our average win is a 1 to5 if we have a $45 win 61 23 and 78 that gives us an average of 1. 51 risk reward all right and what you can do to practice this is basically go over to your trading view choose whatever instruments that you want to use I like to use salana and ethereum primarily and if you just hit shift forward you can play these candles forward one by one okay so what I like to do is add the Luxe algo fair value Gap indicator onto my chart okay you can set a custom threshold here all right and then what you can do is just play this forward and wait for different opportunities to take trades all right so for me I have my sell indicator here which once again is only for the private side of our trading team so now I know we have a fair value Gap here I would set up my entry stop loss over this candle 1 to four initial Target price comes up fills that creates a change of character risk goes down to zero okay so that's Zer R now we have a buy side signal I can do all of my analysis that I would like to do tags me into my position reduce risk at the break of structure targeting 1 to four trailing the second fair value Gap it's a realistically i' probably move my stop loss up to this value now I'm trailing this one all right so there we lock in 8. 6 R so price never really comes up and Taps into that zone so I take this off the table all right so now we have our Trend here we have that change of character fair value Gap midpoint stop loss at break even 1 to four hit realistically I'm moving my stop- loss after this new break of structure all right so then we get stopped out here that's 1. 3 okay so even in two trades I was able to make 9. 9 total risk factors all right so if I'm risking $500 we multiply it by 9. 9 in that trading session I would have had a total profit of about $4, 900 if I was doing it with $50 I would have been able to walk away with about $500 risk risking $50 per trade and I think it's important for you guys to really see where this can scale so when I'm building trading systems I'm using something called posit Cloud which I can run something called r script which I basically just built with AI that I can basically run is going to show me based on a win rate my risk per trade and my average profit per trade which we can find with this what my expected outcome would look like over time so let's say for even example you have a 35% win rate your expected profit is 1 to 4 which with the system is relatively small even starting with $500 you can see after 74 trades with a random assortment of losses we can double our total trading account in 74 trades so if we're taking about three trades a day that's 24 days so we're trading about 4 days a week that's 16 trades per month so even with only being right 35% of the time and letting your winners run okay the data shows and we have all sorts of proof concept of this working in real life okay I do full day trading sessions with me showing you guys I'll put a playlist at the end of the video if you understand the math of this trading and you're doing it properly this is how you can scale we saw one of our team members has 52% win rate that's like 49 trades in order to double your trading account all right so if you're taking three trades a day that's 16 trading days you can see some members are taking a ton of different trades on the given day so he's able to get an 800% growth in something like 3 weeks and you can see I've always looked at support and resistance patterns but nevit trade has helped me structure my trades with specific strategies okay so once again diving into not only this framework but so much more on the private side of our team is allowing us to develop a ton of crazy things all right we're only going to continue to get better into 2025 all right and sort of just to prove this concept of scaling for the New Year I'm going to trade some of my days obviously not all of them cuz I still want to make money trading so I want to trade with large sums but some of the trading days I'm going to be trading on a $100 account and I'm going to be documenting it primarily on Instagram so if you want to follow me on Instagram I'm going to be dropping reals about it sort of teaching what I'm doing what I'm going through emotionally as I'm growing that small amount the goal is to be able to start with1 and be able to make $1, 000 in a single day at a certain point to show you that this math is really what matters and not how much money you're starting with or getting lucky or trying to read news or do anything crazy and then however long that takes me at the end I'm going to have it on YouTube and explain the whole process as well all right so if you're interested in that follow me on in Instagram subscribe to the channel if you haven't already if I helped you understand complex Concepts make sure you hit the like button for the video okay check out these playlists to learn more but until next time I'll see you all in the next one
