Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Core Idea:**
    *   The paper explores using the LightGBM algorithm to predict cryptocurrency price trends (whether prices will fall or not fall).
    *   This model utilizes daily data from 42 cryptocurrencies combined with key economic indicators.
    *   The results show that LightGBM outperforms other methods in robustness and that the strength of the crypto market affects prediction accuracy.

2.  **Core Point:**
    *   The LightGBM model, leveraging combined cryptocurrency and economic data, can effectively predict price trends, showing superior robustness.

3.  **Fundamental Point:**
     *   By accurately forecasting price trends, LightGBM can assist investors in creating optimized cryptocurrency portfolios and managing associated risks.

4.  **Overarching Framework:**
    *   The study establishes a predictive model for cryptocurrency prices using machine learning by leveraging market data and economic indicators. This framework provides a quantitative basis for investment decision making.

Forecasting cryptocurrency prices is crucial for investors. In this paper, we adopt a novel Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithm, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), to forecast the price trend (falling, or not falling) of cryptocurrency market. In order to utilize market information, we combine the daily data of 42 kinds of primary cryptocurrencies with key economic indicators. Results show that the robustness of the LightGBM model is better than the other methods, and the comprehensive strength of the cryptocurrencies impacts the forecasting performance. This can effectively guide investors in constructing an appropriate cryptocurrency portfolio and mitigate risks.
