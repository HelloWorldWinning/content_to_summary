Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Background and Problem:**

*   The rise of small-scale urban Distributed Solar Generation (DSG) necessitates accurate forecasting models.
*   Traditional methods of developing individual models for each DSG are not viable due to a lack of historical data and the large number of DSGs.
*   The challenge is to create a generalizable model that can predict power output for unseen DSGs.

**II. Proposed Solution: Solar Temporal Fusion Transformer (STFT)**

*   Adaptation of the state-of-the-art, attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model.
*   Validation of the self-attention mechanism's generalizability for multi-step time series forecasting.
*   Tested on 188 real-world operational DSG datasets.

**III. Results and Performance**

*   STFT improves significantly over the persistence model by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10, 20, and 30-minute forecast horizons respectively for unseen DSGs.
*   STFT outperforms the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model by 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% at the same forecast horizons.
*   STFT shows superior performance in high-variability periods, particularly during weather transitions.
*   STFT's improved accuracy comes at the expense of higher computational cost compared to other deep learning models.

**IV. Weather Condition Analysis**

*   Performance analyzed under clear, partly cloudy, and overcast conditions.
*   STFT excels during weather transition periods where simpler models tend to lag.

**Core Point:** The study demonstrates that the attention-based STFT model can be generalized to predict power output for unseen DSGs, outperforming traditional models, but comes with a higher computational cost.

**Fundamental Point:** Leveraging self-attention mechanisms in a temporal fusion transformer allows for accurate multi-step time series forecasting of solar power generation, especially in the context of numerous, data-scarce distributed generation units.

**Overarching Framework:** The research centers on a methodology that leverages the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), an attention-based deep learning model, to accurately predict solar power output from distributed solar generation (DSG) units, specifically focusing on scenarios with limited historical data for the individual DSGs. The framework aims to address the real-world problem of forecasting power output for numerous urban DSGs, by developing a generalized model (STFT) that can be applied to unseen sites, validated through rigorous comparative performance analysis. The research investigates model performance under various weather conditions.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
