Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Core Problem & Motivation:**
    *   **Problem:**  Predicting power output for numerous, small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) sites lacking historical data.
    *   **Motivation:** Traditional methods creating individual models for each DSG are not economically feasible in this scenario.

**II. Proposed Solution:**
    *   **Method:** Adapt the attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model, named Solar TFT (STFT).
    *   **Goal:** Validate the generalizability of the self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting of unseen DSGs.

**III. Experimental Results & Findings:**
    *   **Performance vs. Persistence Model:** STFT improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons respectively.
    *   **Performance vs. LSTM:** STFT improves forecast accuracy by 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons respectively.
    *   **Computational Cost:** STFT has higher complexity and computational cost than other deep learning models (e.g., LSTM).
    *   **Weather Conditions:** STFT performs particularly well during weather transitions and high variability periods, outperforming reference models with large lag errors.

**IV. Trade-Offs**
    *   **Accuracy vs. Efficiency:** Practical applications must weigh the superior accuracy of STFT against its increased computational cost.

**Core Point:** The Solar TFT (STFT) model, adapted from a Temporal Fusion Transformer, demonstrates superior multi-step forecasting accuracy for unseen distributed solar generation sites, particularly during volatile weather, at the expense of higher computational cost.

**Fundamental Point:**  A generalized self-attention mechanism, exemplified by the STFT model, is effective in forecasting power output for distributed solar generation, even with limited historical data, showcasing the potential for efficient deployment in urban environments.

**Overarching Framework:** This study explores the use of advanced deep-learning (specifically, attention-based) models to address the challenge of distributed solar power forecasting in data-scarce scenarios, emphasizing the trade-off between predictive accuracy and computational cost.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
