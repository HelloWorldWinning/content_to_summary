Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   The video is a tutorial on how to estimate ARCH models, a topic frequently requested.
    *   Data for replication and EViews work files are available for download via a provided link.
    *   Slides are also included in the link.

2.  **What is ARCH?**
    *   ARCH stands for Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity, introduced by Engel in 1982.
    *   Expanded upon by Bollerslev in 1986 with GARCH models.
    *   Traditional models focus on modeling the mean, but ARCH models focus on the variance.
    *   Many time series exhibit periods of high volatility, violating the homoscedasticity assumption.

3.  **Volatility Clustering:**
    *   Volatility tends to cluster: periods of high volatility are followed by other high volatility periods, and vice versa.
    *   This is evident in stock market data, where volatility can increase during market events (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic).

4.  **ARCH Model Considerations:**
    *   ARCH is used for series with changing volatility over time (heteroskedasticity).
    *   Volatility is conditional on previous lags, demonstrating autocorrelation.
    *   The variance is not constant and changes depending on recent past values.
    *   Volatility models are used with stationary time series that have non-constant variance.
    *   The variance depends on past squared innovations (residuals).

5.  **Formalities of ARCH Models:**
    *   Mean Equation: y(t) is explained by a constant, a lag of itself, and an error term. It can be specified as an AR, MA, or ARMA model.
    *   Error Term: follows a normal distribution with zero mean and a time-dependent variance (ht).
    *   Variance Equation: ht depends on a constant (alpha 0) and past squared residual errors (alpha times past squared error).
    *   Conditions:
        *   All alphas must be greater than 0 to ensure a positive variance.
        *   The sum of the alphas must be less than 1 to avoid explosive results.
        *   Alphas should decrease from recent lags to older lags because recent events have more influence.

6.  **Steps to Estimate ARCH Models:**
    *   **Part 1: Mean Equation**
        *   Step 1: Verify that the variable is stationary.
        *   Step 2: Determine the appropriate ARMA model.
    *   **Part 2: Variance Equation**
        *   Step 3: Test for existence of ARCH effects.
        *   Step 4: Estimate the ARCH model.

7.  **Application Example:**
    *   The example uses Toronto Stock Exchange returns data, which showed non-stationarity at levels but stationarity after applying differencing and logarithms.
    *   An ARMA(1,1) model is chosen for the mean equation based on the correlogram.
    *   Heteroskedasticity tests confirm the presence of ARCH effects, so the ARCH model is appropriate.
    *   Correlogram of squared residuals is used to determine the appropriate ARCH order.

8.  **Model Estimation and Diagnostics:**
    *   An ARCH(2) model is estimated, and its coefficients are found to be significant.
    *   Model diagnostics:
        *   Heteroskedasticity test is performed again on the model to confirm there's no arch effects are still present.
        *   Correlogram and Q-test to confirm residuals are white noise and no autocorrelation.
    *   Conditional variance of the ARCH model is graphed along with the original time series.

9.  **Conclusion:**
    *   The video provides a practical guide to estimating ARCH models for analyzing volatility in time series data.
    *   ARCH models account for time-varying variance based on past squared innovations.

**Core Point:**  ARCH models are specifically designed to capture and model the time-varying volatility (heteroskedasticity) that is frequently observed in financial time series data, based on the conditional variance on the past squared residuals.

**Fundamental Point:** Modeling the variance using ARCH methodology allows us to account for volatility clustering and improve the accuracy of forecasting financial variables where heteroskedasticity is a core feature of data.

**Overarching Framework:**
The content is structured as a tutorial following a step-by-step approach to understand ARCH models from their theoretical foundation to their practical application in EViews with a real data example. It includes:
    1. Concept introduction and definition.
    2.  Theoretical foundations of the model, including core assumptions and its mathematical representation.
    3. Practical estimation using Eviews.
    4. Verification and diagnostics of the estimation.
    5. Visualization of the results.

regressive arch stands for auto regressive conditional heteroskedasticity conditional heteroskedasticity conditional heteroskedasticity this model was introduced by engel in this model was introduced by engel in this model was introduced by engel in 1982 in his paper entitled 1982 in his paper entitled 1982 in his paper entitled autoregressive conditional autoregressive conditional autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity with estimates of the heteroskedasticity with estimates of the heteroskedasticity with estimates of the variance of united kingdom inflation variance of united kingdom inflation variance of united kingdom inflation the model was later expanded in 1986 by the model was later expanded in 1986 by the model was later expanded in 1986 by wallerslab when he introduced carch wallerslab when he introduced carch wallerslab when he introduced carch models models models so so far we have focused on modeling so so far we have focused on modeling so so far we have focused on modeling the mean the mean the mean of the dependent variable so in other of the dependent variable so in other of the dependent variable so in other words we were trying to predict what is words we were trying to predict what is words we were trying to predict what is the value the value the value of for example gdp in the next quarter of for example gdp in the next quarter of for example gdp in the next quarter or inflation or inflation or inflation or interest rates however in this or interest rates however in this or interest rates however in this lecture we are not going to focus on the lecture we are not going to focus on the lecture we are not going to focus on the mean mean mean we are going to focus on the variance so we are going to focus on the variance so we are going to focus on the variance so traditional econometrics models traditional econometrics models traditional econometrics models assume that the variance of the assume that the variance of the assume that the variance of the disturbance term is constant disturbance term is constant disturbance term is constant over time yet many economic time series over time yet many economic time series over time yet many economic time series face periods of higher volatility than face periods of higher volatility than face periods of higher volatility than usual violating the homoscedasticity usual violating the homoscedasticity usual violating the homoscedasticity assumption assumption assumption therefore asset holders and financial therefore asset holders and financial therefore asset holders and financial institutions institutions institutions may be interested in estimating not only may be interested in estimating not only may be interested in estimating not only the returns the returns the returns but also the variance of the assets so but also the variance of the assets so but also the variance of the assets so we'll talk a little bit about volatility we'll talk a little bit about volatility we'll talk a little bit about volatility clustering clustering clustering for today's example i have toronto stock for today's example i have toronto stock for today's example i have toronto stock exchange returns exchange returns exchange returns and here is the graph where starts in and here is the graph where starts in and here is the graph where starts in goes to the present 2021 this is daily goes to the present 2021 this is daily goes to the present 2021 this is daily data data data and you can see that the returns the and you can see that the returns the and you can see that the returns the volatility has been pretty stable over volatility has been pretty stable over volatility has been pretty stable over time time time however there's been a big gap in here however there's been a big gap in here however there's been a big gap in here there's been a big there's been a big there's been a big issue here in the beginning of 2020 with issue here in the beginning of 2020 with issue here in the beginning of 2020 with kobe then we've seen that kobe then we've seen that kobe then we've seen that the volatility has increased in a the volatility has increased in a the volatility has increased in a significant way significant way significant way and it has remained quite volatile over and it has remained quite volatile over and it has remained quite volatile over this period this period this period so when we are talking about volatility so when we are talking about volatility so when we are talking about volatility clustering clustering clustering this is to mention that it's a common this is to mention that it's a common this is to mention that it's a common effect in equity markets effect in equity markets effect in equity markets and its periods of small volatility are and its periods of small volatility are and its periods of small volatility are followed followed followed by small volatility periods however when by small volatility periods however when by small volatility periods however when there is a period of higher volatility there is a period of higher volatility there is a period of higher volatility then those periods are followed by then those periods are followed by then those periods are followed by higher volatility periods as well higher volatility periods as well higher volatility periods as well moving to this next slide you can see i moving to this next slide you can see i moving to this next slide you can see i have included have included have included on one axis i have included the returns on one axis i have included the returns on one axis i have included the returns with the volatility with the volatility with the volatility here increasing in the 2020 and this is here increasing in the 2020 and this is here increasing in the 2020 and this is the graph the graph the graph of the exchange of the tsx of the exchange of the tsx of the exchange of the tsx exchange and you can see that it has exchange and you can see that it has exchange and you can see that it has been in an increasing trend been in an increasing trend been in an increasing trend however in 2020 there has been a big however in 2020 there has been a big however in 2020 there has been a big drop drop drop and that's the reason why volatility had and that's the reason why volatility had and that's the reason why volatility had increased consequently increased consequently increased consequently assuming that the variance is constant assuming that the variance is constant assuming that the variance is constant over time might not be appropriate and over time might not be appropriate and over time might not be appropriate and we might not be incorporating all the we might not be incorporating all the we might not be incorporating all the volatility that is in this volatility that is in this volatility that is in this variable so let's move to talk about variable so let's move to talk about variable so let's move to talk about some considerations of arch some considerations of arch some considerations of arch the concept arch refers to series with the concept arch refers to series with the concept arch refers to series with volatility volatility volatility changing over time that's why we're changing over time that's why we're changing over time that's why we're talking about heteroskedasticity talking about heteroskedasticity talking about heteroskedasticity and it's conditional to previous lags and it's conditional to previous lags and it's conditional to previous lags autocorrelation that's why we're talking autocorrelation that's why we're talking autocorrelation that's why we're talking about autoregressive conditional about autoregressive conditional about autoregressive conditional so it's basically we're saying it's not so it's basically we're saying it's not so it's basically we're saying it's not constant over time the variance constant over time the variance constant over time the variance and that variance is going to be and that variance is going to be and that variance is going to be conditional yes it's going to be conditional yes it's going to be conditional yes it's going to be changing depending on what happened in changing depending on what happened in changing depending on what happened in the previous in the previous lags yes in the previous in the previous lags yes in the previous in the previous lags yes in the recent past the recent past the recent past so volatility models are performed over so volatility models are performed over so volatility models are performed over stationary time series stationary time series stationary time series we are talking about the mean but with a we are talking about the mean but with a we are talking about the mean but with a non-constant variance non-constant variance non-constant variance so when modeling arch the variance so when modeling arch the variance so when modeling arch the variance depends on past squared innovations depends on past squared innovations depends on past squared innovations so we previously learned how to estimate so we previously learned how to estimate so we previously learned how to estimate the mean of a univariate time series the mean of a univariate time series the mean of a univariate time series with arima models with arima models with arima models so now we will verify if the model shows so now we will verify if the model shows so now we will verify if the model shows periods periods periods of higher volatility by checking the of higher volatility by checking the of higher volatility by checking the existence of harsh effects existence of harsh effects existence of harsh effects let's move into the formalities of arch let's move into the formalities of arch let's move into the formalities of arch models this first equation models this first equation models this first equation is the mean equation i have my variable is the mean equation i have my variable is the mean equation i have my variable yt which is going to be explained by a yt which is going to be explained by a yt which is going to be explained by a constant constant constant and the lag value of itself and an error and the lag value of itself and an error and the lag value of itself and an error term so this is an autoregressive model term so this is an autoregressive model term so this is an autoregressive model be aware that the mean you can estimate be aware that the mean you can estimate be aware that the mean you can estimate it also with moving average it also with moving average it also with moving average components you can estimate an arma components you can estimate an arma components you can estimate an arma model so model so model so whatever the type of specification that whatever the type of specification that whatever the type of specification that you do will be fine you do will be fine you do will be fine as long as you all we need to do is to as long as you all we need to do is to as long as you all we need to do is to estimate estimate estimate find an appropriate model to estimate find an appropriate model to estimate find an appropriate model to estimate the mean the second equation the mean the second equation the mean the second equation corresponds to the error which is going corresponds to the error which is going corresponds to the error which is going to be conditional to be conditional to be conditional to the previous information and to the previous information and to the previous information and it's following a normal distribution it's following a normal distribution it's following a normal distribution with zero mean with zero mean with zero mean and here in the ht i have the variance and here in the ht i have the variance and here in the ht i have the variance is going to depend on time and this h is going to depend on time and this h is going to depend on time and this h stands for heteroskedasticity stands for heteroskedasticity stands for heteroskedasticity so some people put here the sigma square so some people put here the sigma square so some people put here the sigma square some other um like textbooks on the some other um like textbooks on the some other um like textbooks on the paper paper paper of a granger uh do the h so that's why i of a granger uh do the h so that's why i of a granger uh do the h so that's why i have have have written an agent here so what is this h written an agent here so what is this h written an agent here so what is this h what is what is what is this variance going to be depending on this variance going to be depending on this variance going to be depending on well this variant depends well this variant depends well this variant depends basically on on a constant and the basically on on a constant and the basically on on a constant and the previous previous previous uh square residual errors uh square residual errors uh square residual errors so what are we trying to say in here so so what are we trying to say in here so so what are we trying to say in here so basically all we are saying with this basically all we are saying with this basically all we are saying with this type of specification is that the type of specification is that the type of specification is that the variance variance variance the volatility of the variance is going the volatility of the variance is going the volatility of the variance is going to be basically depending on what to be basically depending on what to be basically depending on what happened in the previous in the recent happened in the previous in the recent happened in the previous in the recent past past past and this model has to satisfy a couple and this model has to satisfy a couple and this model has to satisfy a couple of conditions so the first of conditions so the first of conditions so the first thing of all is that the alpha 0 and all thing of all is that the alpha 0 and all thing of all is that the alpha 0 and all the other alphas as well the other alphas as well the other alphas as well alpha 1 alpha 2 until alpha n have to be alpha 1 alpha 2 until alpha n have to be alpha 1 alpha 2 until alpha n have to be bigger than 0 and this is to guarantee bigger than 0 and this is to guarantee bigger than 0 and this is to guarantee a positive variance the second thing a positive variance the second thing a positive variance the second thing that we have to ensure is that the that we have to ensure is that the that we have to ensure is that the sum of all the alphas so alpha one sum of all the alphas so alpha one sum of all the alphas so alpha one until alpha n um the sum doesn't exceed until alpha n um the sum doesn't exceed until alpha n um the sum doesn't exceed one and the reason that we need that to one and the reason that we need that to one and the reason that we need that to be true be true be true is so the model always returns to the is so the model always returns to the is so the model always returns to the same mean and it doesn't have an same mean and it doesn't have an same mean and it doesn't have an explosive result explosive result explosive result and finally what we need to ask is that and finally what we need to ask is that and finally what we need to ask is that all the alpha so alpha 1 all the alpha so alpha 1 all the alpha so alpha 1 has to be bigger than alpha 2 and has to has to be bigger than alpha 2 and has to has to be bigger than alpha 2 and has to be bigger than alpha 3 and has to be be bigger than alpha 3 and has to be be bigger than alpha 3 and has to be bigger than alpha bigger than alpha bigger than alpha n so basically we are going to be n so basically we are going to be n so basically we are going to be estimating an arch model estimating an arch model estimating an arch model with potentially more than one lag yes with potentially more than one lag yes with potentially more than one lag yes that's why there's a p that's why there's a p that's why there's a p in here we have to determine how many in here we have to determine how many in here we have to determine how many arch components we are including in our arch components we are including in our arch components we are including in our variance model but what we need to variance model but what we need to variance model but what we need to verify verify verify is that the first leg is going to be is that the first leg is going to be is that the first leg is going to be bigger than the second line bigger than the second line bigger than the second line and it's going to be bigger than the and it's going to be bigger than the and it's going to be bigger than the third line bigger than third line bigger than third line bigger than the n lag and the reason for this is the n lag and the reason for this is the n lag and the reason for this is because the recent pass has more because the recent pass has more because the recent pass has more influence than older lags influence than older lags influence than older lags what we're saying basically with this um what we're saying basically with this um what we're saying basically with this um statement statement statement is that what happened yesterday will is that what happened yesterday will is that what happened yesterday will have more weight have more weight have more weight that what happened probably three four that what happened probably three four that what happened probably three four five five five six months ago okay so recent six months ago okay so recent six months ago okay so recent information is going to have information is going to have information is going to have more um it's going to have more weight more um it's going to have more weight more um it's going to have more weight than very old information what are the than very old information what are the than very old information what are the steps to estimate arch models well steps to estimate arch models well steps to estimate arch models well estimating arch models involves estimating arch models involves estimating arch models involves two parts and each of this part has two two parts and each of this part has two two parts and each of this part has two steps steps steps so the first part is the mean equation so the first part is the mean equation so the first part is the mean equation where where where the two steps involving estimating the the two steps involving estimating the the two steps involving estimating the mean equation are stationarity mean equation are stationarity mean equation are stationarity our variable needs to be stationary to our variable needs to be stationary to our variable needs to be stationary to estimate the mean equation estimate the mean equation estimate the mean equation and the step number two is well finding and the step number two is well finding and the step number two is well finding the appropriate arima model the appropriate arima model the appropriate arima model to estimate the mean we have already to estimate the mean we have already to estimate the mean we have already seen how to estimate arima model so i'm seen how to estimate arima model so i'm seen how to estimate arima model so i'm not going to focus too much on not going to focus too much on not going to focus too much on explaining the whole procedure of arima explaining the whole procedure of arima explaining the whole procedure of arima models so please feel free to watch models so please feel free to watch models so please feel free to watch my arima models tutorial and then part my arima models tutorial and then part my arima models tutorial and then part two is the variance equation two is the variance equation two is the variance equation so once we have estimated the mean we so once we have estimated the mean we so once we have estimated the mean we need to check need to check need to check if there exists arch effects or not and if there exists arch effects or not and if there exists arch effects or not and if it and if it does exceed starch if it and if it does exceed starch if it and if it does exceed starch effects then we have to estimate the effects then we have to estimate the effects then we have to estimate the arch model arch model arch model so let's begin with part one so the so let's begin with part one so the so let's begin with part one so the first part would be first part would be first part would be checking for stationarity you would checking for stationarity you would checking for stationarity you would normally do a graph analysis correlogram normally do a graph analysis correlogram normally do a graph analysis correlogram formal test formal test formal test but for this example we're just going to but for this example we're just going to but for this example we're just going to be taking a look at the authentic filter be taking a look at the authentic filter be taking a look at the authentic filter results and confirm if our variable is results and confirm if our variable is results and confirm if our variable is non-stationary levels non-stationary levels non-stationary levels but we have to then check if it's but we have to then check if it's but we have to then check if it's stationary differences stationary differences stationary differences any views i have here my variable the any views i have here my variable the any views i have here my variable the toronto stock exchange toronto stock exchange toronto stock exchange i'm going to open this variable and i'm going to open this variable and i'm going to open this variable and we're going to see the graph and as you can see this graph has a and as you can see this graph has a and as you can see this graph has a positive trend where there's a big drop positive trend where there's a big drop positive trend where there's a big drop in the beginning of 2020 due to code and in the beginning of 2020 due to code and in the beginning of 2020 due to code and then it then it then it goes back to this positive trend goes back to this positive trend goes back to this positive trend so this clearly is showing a so this clearly is showing a so this clearly is showing a non-stationary variable we can non-stationary variable we can non-stationary variable we can do the unit root test the augmented key do the unit root test the augmented key do the unit root test the augmented key filter test and i'm going to include a filter test and i'm going to include a filter test and i'm going to include a trend and an intercept because we can trend and an intercept because we can trend and an intercept because we can see there is a positive trend in this so the first thing that i would take a so the first thing that i would take a so the first thing that i would take a look at here is whether look at here is whether look at here is whether including the constant and the trend was including the constant and the trend was including the constant and the trend was appropriate and we can see that appropriate and we can see that appropriate and we can see that at the five percent significance level at the five percent significance level at the five percent significance level we can confirm that included the we can confirm that included the we can confirm that included the constant and the trend where appropriate constant and the trend where appropriate constant and the trend where appropriate since the p-value is smaller than point since the p-value is smaller than point since the p-value is smaller than point zero five zero five zero five and here we have the results of our and here we have the results of our and here we have the results of our tests the results are telling me tests the results are telling me tests the results are telling me that we cannot reject my null hypothesis that we cannot reject my null hypothesis that we cannot reject my null hypothesis so we're going to be moving now into so we're going to be moving now into so we're going to be moving now into working with the returns which the working with the returns which the working with the returns which the returns of these returns of these returns of these of the toronto stock exchange they'll be of the toronto stock exchange they'll be of the toronto stock exchange they'll be stationary stationary stationary um and also that's what we are um and also that's what we are um and also that's what we are interested about determining yes the interested about determining yes the interested about determining yes the volatility of our returns volatility of our returns volatility of our returns so i'm going to generate the variable so i'm going to generate the variable so i'm going to generate the variable i'm going to type i'm going to type i'm going to type i would like to call it returns and i'm i would like to call it returns and i'm i would like to call it returns and i'm going to type d going to type d going to type d log so i'm using differences unlock and log so i'm using differences unlock and log so i'm using differences unlock and that's what it's going to estimate for that's what it's going to estimate for that's what it's going to estimate for you the returns you the returns you the returns of your variable so i i have here of your variable so i i have here of your variable so i i have here the tsx which is my variable so i'm the tsx which is my variable so i'm the tsx which is my variable so i'm going to hit ok and i have estimated now going to hit ok and i have estimated now going to hit ok and i have estimated now my variable returns my variable returns my variable returns we're going to see the graph we're going to see the graph we're going to see the graph and as you can see now here i have the and as you can see now here i have the and as you can see now here i have the returns this is returns this is returns this is basically applying differences and logs basically applying differences and logs basically applying differences and logs to your variable to your variable to your variable and this variable does look uh that it and this variable does look uh that it and this variable does look uh that it has has has a stationary however we can definitely a stationary however we can definitely a stationary however we can definitely see that the variance is non-con see that the variance is non-con see that the variance is non-con is not constant yeah so this is what we is not constant yeah so this is what we is not constant yeah so this is what we are interested in modeling are interested in modeling are interested in modeling so we're going to go into view unit root so we're going to go into view unit root so we're going to go into view unit root test test test we are going to select nothing no trend we are going to select nothing no trend we are going to select nothing no trend or intercept because it doesn't have a or intercept because it doesn't have a or intercept because it doesn't have a trend trend trend um so we're going to hit ok now and we um so we're going to hit ok now and we um so we're going to hit ok now and we can see that the returns can see that the returns can see that the returns yes once we apply differences unlock my yes once we apply differences unlock my yes once we apply differences unlock my variable is stationary variable is stationary variable is stationary since i can i can reject my null since i can i can reject my null since i can i can reject my null hypothesis that my series has a unit hypothesis that my series has a unit hypothesis that my series has a unit root root root consequently my series is stationary so that's that's good so we can now so that's that's good so we can now so that's that's good so we can now estimate the mean equation so that's estimate the mean equation so that's estimate the mean equation so that's going to be the step number one going to be the step number one going to be the step number one so now we are going to move in step so now we are going to move in step so now we are going to move in step number two we have already checked number two we have already checked number two we have already checked for stationarity we have confirmed that for stationarity we have confirmed that for stationarity we have confirmed that my serious my serious my serious um toronto stock exchange is not um toronto stock exchange is not um toronto stock exchange is not stationary levels but when we take a stationary levels but when we take a stationary levels but when we take a look at the returns this is applying look at the returns this is applying look at the returns this is applying differences and logs my series differences and logs my series differences and logs my series is stationary and now we will is stationary and now we will is stationary and now we will try to identify an arima model yes we try to identify an arima model yes we try to identify an arima model yes we will select the order of p and q will select the order of p and q will select the order of p and q p is for the auto regressive component p is for the auto regressive component p is for the auto regressive component and q stands for the and q stands for the and q stands for the moving average components looking at the moving average components looking at the moving average components looking at the krillogram krillogram krillogram so let's go into views now and estimate so let's go into views now and estimate so let's go into views now and estimate the mean equation the mean equation the mean equation i'm going to open my variable returns i'm going to open my variable returns i'm going to open my variable returns that we have just generated that we have just generated that we have just generated i'm going to go into view and i'm going to go into view and i'm going to go into view and corellogram corellogram corellogram we're going to leave in levels as you we're going to leave in levels as you we're going to leave in levels as you can see can see can see recall from my tutorials where i where i recall from my tutorials where i where i recall from my tutorials where i where i guys show you how to estimate the ribba guys show you how to estimate the ribba guys show you how to estimate the ribba model so we have to look at the model so we have to look at the model so we have to look at the autocorrelation and the partial autocorrelation and the partial autocorrelation and the partial autocorrelation to autocorrelation to autocorrelation to to be able to identify the orders of p to be able to identify the orders of p to be able to identify the orders of p and q and q and q so all of those bars that are exceeding so all of those bars that are exceeding so all of those bars that are exceeding my confidence balance those are my confidence balance those are my confidence balance those are potential lag potential lag potential lag orders however due to parsimony and just orders however due to parsimony and just orders however due to parsimony and just to make it simple i'm just going to be to make it simple i'm just going to be to make it simple i'm just going to be estimating an arima estimating an arima estimating an arima 1-1 model but please be aware that you 1-1 model but please be aware that you 1-1 model but please be aware that you could try with other type of could try with other type of could try with other type of specifications as well as you can see specifications as well as you can see specifications as well as you can see here there are a couple bars that are here there are a couple bars that are here there are a couple bars that are exceeding exceeding exceeding however as i mentioned i'm interested in however as i mentioned i'm interested in however as i mentioned i'm interested in estimating estimating estimating um a parsimonious model this is not um a parsimonious model this is not um a parsimonious model this is not included so many likes and it's just for included so many likes and it's just for included so many likes and it's just for this example this example this example so we're going to estimate the mean so so we're going to estimate the mean so so we're going to estimate the mean so i'm going to type in my command i'm going to type in my command i'm going to type in my command section ls which is for list squares section ls which is for list squares section ls which is for list squares now the name of my variable which is now the name of my variable which is now the name of my variable which is returns i'm going to include a constant returns i'm going to include a constant returns i'm going to include a constant an ar1 term and then an ar1 term and then an ar1 term and then an ma1 term that's what we have an ma1 term that's what we have an ma1 term that's what we have determined by looking at the determined by looking at the determined by looking at the correlogram so i'm going to hit enter correlogram so i'm going to hit enter correlogram so i'm going to hit enter now now now and here i have the results of my model and here i have the results of my model and here i have the results of my model we can see that the ar component we can see that the ar component we can see that the ar component is appropriate is significant is appropriate is significant is appropriate is significant statistically significant and also statistically

statistically significant now that we have estimated the equation now that we have estimated the equation now that we have estimated the equation of our mean including of our mean including of our mean including an ar 1 and an ma1 component an ar 1 and an ma1 component an ar 1 and an ma1 component we can move into part 2 which is going we can move into part 2 which is going we can move into part 2 which is going to be checking for the existence of the to be checking for the existence of the to be checking for the existence of the arch effects arch effects arch effects so we're going to conduct the so we're going to conduct the so we're going to conduct the heteroscedasticity test and select the heteroscedasticity test and select the heteroscedasticity test and select the arch option arch option arch option the null hypothesis of this test is that the null hypothesis of this test is that the null hypothesis of this test is that there is no existing arch effects there is no existing arch effects there is no existing arch effects up to the specified line and the up to the specified line and the up to the specified line and the alternative hypothesis is that there are alternative hypothesis is that there are alternative hypothesis is that there are art effects up to the specified light as art effects up to the specified light as art effects up to the specified

significance level at the five percent significance level we reject the null hypothesis and we reject the null hypothesis and we reject the null hypothesis and confirm the existence of confirm the existence of confirm the existence of arch effects so any views what we want arch effects so any views what we want arch effects so any views what we want to do right now is to check whether to do right now is to check whether to do right now is to check whether exists exists exists arch effects or not in my model i'm arch effects or not in my model i'm arch effects or not in my model i'm going to go then in view going to go then in view going to go then in view residual diagnostics and residual diagnostics and residual diagnostics and heteroskedasticity tests heteroskedasticity tests heteroskedasticity tests we're going to select the arch option we're going to select the arch option we're going to select the arch option and in the number of lags we're going to and in the number of lags we're going to and in the number of lags we're going to leave for now leave for now leave for now a one however later on i'm going to a one however later on i'm going to a one however later on i'm going to show you how we can determine the right show you how we can determine the right show you how we can determine the right amount of likes to include in this model amount of likes to include in this model amount of likes to include in this model so i'm going to hitting okay for now and so i'm going to hitting okay for now and so i'm going to hitting okay for now and here we have here we have here we have the test output and let's go back into the test output and let's go back into the test output and let's go back into the slides so we can do an analysis of the slides so we can do an analysis of the slides so we can do an analysis of these results these results these results in my screen you can see the in my screen you can see the in my screen you can see the heteroskedasticity test output heteroskedasticity test output heteroskedasticity test output here i put that the null hypothesis is here i put that the null hypothesis is here i put that the null hypothesis is that there is no arch effects up to the that there is no arch effects up to the that there is no arch effects up to the specified lagged order specified lagged order specified lagged order and as a hint if the p-value is smaller and as a hint if the p-value is smaller and as a hint if the p-value is smaller than 0. 05 than 0. 05 than 0. 05 we reject the null hypothesis and we we reject the null hypothesis and we we reject the null hypothesis and we confirm the existence of arch effects confirm the existence of arch effects confirm the existence of arch effects so that's what we can see in our example so that's what we can see in our example so that's what we can see in our example we can see that we are rejecting the we can see that we are rejecting the we can see that we are rejecting the null hypothesis null hypothesis null hypothesis and we are confirming that there exists and we are confirming that there exists and we are confirming that there exists architects in my model architects in my model architects in my model indeed remember that we included one lag indeed remember that we included one lag indeed remember that we included one lag in the in the in the test specification and we can see that test specification and we can see that test specification and we can see that this five percent significant level this five percent significant level this five percent significant level including that one lag is appropriate including that one lag is appropriate including that one lag is appropriate so my heteroskedasticity test is telling so my heteroskedasticity test is telling so my heteroskedasticity test is telling me that there are artifacts me that there are artifacts me that there are artifacts and also that including one arch one and also that including one arch one and also that including one arch one arch effect arch effect arch effect is appropriate however i would like to is appropriate however i would like to is appropriate however i would like to know if know if know if including more arch elements are including more arch elements are including more arch elements are appropriate in this model let's talk appropriate in this model let's talk appropriate in this model let's talk about how to determine the arch order so about how to determine the arch order so about how to determine the arch order so we have tested we have tested we have tested for the existence of arch effects up to for the existence of arch effects up to for the existence of arch effects up to order one order one order one however we can include more arch effects however we can include more arch effects however we can include more arch effects in the model we can review the in the model we can review the in the model we can review the correlogram of the square residuals and correlogram of the square residuals and correlogram of the square residuals and similar to arima models similar to arima models similar to arima models the partial autocorrelation function the partial autocorrelation function the partial autocorrelation function we'll provide some insights about the we'll provide some insights about the we'll provide some insights about the order order order recall parsimony we want to keep the recall parsimony we want to keep the recall parsimony we want to keep the model simple so model simple so model simple so we don't want to over fit the variance we don't want to over fit the variance we don't want to over fit the variance equation including equation including equation including so many large components finally so many large components finally so many large components finally recall that the arch effects cannot be recall that the arch effects cannot be recall that the arch effects cannot be negative so sometimes negative so sometimes negative so sometimes overfitting the model this is including overfitting the model this is including overfitting the model this is including so many lags so many lags so many lags is going to make all your arch effects is going to make all your arch effects is going to make all your arch effects negative so that's negative so that's negative so that's definitely not appropriate it's not a definitely not appropriate it's not a definitely not appropriate it's not a correct specification correct specification correct specification so that if that happens to your model so that if that happens to your model so that if that happens to your model where you see that where you see that where you see that there are many arch lags that there are many arch lags that there are many arch lags that become negative you need to start become negative you need to start become negative you need to start removing lags from your removing lags from your removing lags from your model specification so this is one of model specification so this is one of model specification so this is one of the flaws of arch models is determining the flaws of arch models is determining the flaws of arch models is determining the order of arch effects the order of arch effects the order of arch effects some models can incorporate many lags some models can incorporate many lags some models can incorporate many lags and this can be a bit complicated and and this can be a bit complicated and and this can be a bit complicated and even annoying to deal with even annoying to deal with even annoying to deal with so this is when guards models come to so this is when guards models come to so this is when guards models come to play play play as garch models can provide an as garch models can provide an as garch models can provide an alternative solution to alternative solution to alternative solution to dealing with arch models with so many dealing with arch models with so many dealing with arch models with so many lags however for this tutorial we are lags however for this tutorial we are lags however for this tutorial we are not going to focus on garch we'll not going to focus on garch we'll not going to focus on garch we'll proceed now with our proceed now with our proceed now with our arch model estimation so arch model estimation so arch model estimation so we're going to do now is we're going to we're going to do now is we're going to we're going to do now is we're going to double check what is the correct double check what is the correct double check what is the correct order of arch components to include in order of arch components to include in order of arch components to include in the variance equation the variance equation the variance equation so any views what we're going to now is so any views what we're going to now is so any views what we're going to now is go into view go into view go into view residual diagnostics and correlogram residual diagnostics and correlogram residual diagnostics and correlogram square residuals square residuals square residuals we're going to leave the default lag we're going to leave the default lag we're going to leave the default lag specification specification specification and here what we can see is that in the and here what we can see is that in the and here what we can see is that in the autocorrelation autocorrelation autocorrelation there is some persistence yes in the lux there is some persistence yes in the lux there is some persistence yes in the lux so that's basically why our test our so that's basically why our test our so that's basically why our test our heteroskedasticity test was confirming heteroskedasticity test was confirming heteroskedasticity test was confirming the existence of arch effects we can see the existence of arch effects we can see the existence of arch effects we can see that there is some persistence in this that there is some persistence in this that there is some persistence in this autocorrelation autocorrelation autocorrelation and also in the partial correlation we and also in the partial correlation we and also in the partial correlation we can see that there are some can see that there are some can see that there are some significant bars so that's what significant bars so that's what significant bars so that's what suggesting is possible suggesting is possible suggesting is possible arch effects so again we want to keep a arch effects so again we want to keep a arch effects so again we want to keep a parsimonious model so i'm not going to parsimonious model so i'm not going to parsimonious model so i'm not going to be including too many artifacts but what be including too many artifacts but what be including too many artifacts but what we can do is definitely we can do is definitely we can do is definitely test perform again the test and include test perform again the test and include test perform again the test and include more lags so i'm going to go into view more lags so i'm going to go into view more lags so i'm going to go into view um a residual diagnostic um a residual diagnostic um a residual diagnostic heteroscenasticity test heteroscenasticity test heteroscenasticity test and again you guys can try you can and again you guys can try you can and again you guys can try you can include more lags include more lags include more lags however for this example i'm just gonna however for this example i'm just gonna however for this example i'm just gonna stick to two stick to two stick to two remember that if you include too many remember that if you include too many remember that if you include too many you're going to be overfeeding the model you're going to be overfeeding the model you're going to be overfeeding the model and some of your arch effects are going and some of your arch effects are going and some of your arch effects are going to become negative and that to become negative and that to become negative and that shouldn't be the case so let's just for shouldn't be the case so let's just for shouldn't be the case so let's just for this example this example this example going to using two lags so using two going to using two lags so using two going to using two lags so using two lags we can lags we can lags we can confirm then again is that both legs are confirm then again is that both legs are confirm then again is that both legs are statistically significant statistically significant statistically significant so then doing an arch an arch so then doing an arch an arch so then doing an arch an arch uh folder 2 is going to be appropriate uh folder 2 is going to be appropriate uh folder 2 is going to be appropriate so now it's time to estimate our arch 2 so now it's time to estimate our arch 2 so now it's time to estimate our arch 2 model model model so we have a model for the mean equation so we have a model for the mean equation so we have a model for the mean equation which remember we are including a which remember we are including a which remember we are including a constant constant constant we said that for the mean we were we said that for the mean we were we said that for the mean we were including an ar1 including an ar1 including an ar1 and an mi1 component and also we agreed and an mi1 component and also we agreed and an mi1 component and also we agreed to include two arch effects to include two arch effects to include two arch effects so let's go now into views and let's so let's go now into views and let's so let's go now into views and let's estimate this arch to estimate this arch to estimate this arch to model you're going to go into quick model you're going to go into quick model you're going to go into quick estimate equation and the first thing estimate equation and the first thing estimate equation and the first thing that i recommend you to do in here that i recommend you to do in here that i recommend you to do in here is to go into arch is to go into arch is to go into arch when you're going to arch the following when you're going to arch the following when you're going to arch the following is going to appear and as you can see is going to appear and as you can see is going to appear and as you can see the first box is asking you to write the first box is asking you to write the first box is asking you to write what is your mean equation what is your mean equation what is your mean equation i remember that my mean equation was i remember that my mean equation was i remember that my mean equation was well the returns well the returns well the returns of of the toronto stock exchange then of of the toronto stock exchange then of of the toronto stock exchange then was including a constant was including a constant was including a constant the ar1 mod component and the ma1 the ar1 mod component and the ma1 the ar1 mod component and the ma1 component component component and the second part the second box in and the second part the second box in and the second part the second box in here is asking me here is asking me here is asking me how many arch and garg effects we want how many arch and garg effects we want how many arch and garg effects we want to include to include to include four guards we're going to put zero four guards we're going to put zero four guards we're going to put zero since we haven't talked about carch since we haven't talked about carch since we haven't talked about carch models in this tutorial models in this tutorial models in this tutorial and for arch we have agreed that we were and for arch we have agreed that we were and for arch we have agreed that we were going to use going to use going to use two lags two arch effects and the second two lags two arch effects and the second two lags two arch effects and the second thing that you want to check is going to thing that you want to check is going to thing that you want to check is going to options and you want to ensure that the options and you want to ensure that the options and you want to ensure that the back pass parameter is set to 0. 7 back pass parameter is set to 0. 7 back pass parameter is set to 0. 7 you definitely don't want to put it into you definitely don't want to put it into you definitely don't want to put it into one because that's going to be the one because that's going to be the one because that's going to be the unconditional um unconditional back pass unconditional um unconditional back pass unconditional um unconditional back pass parameter parameter parameter so we're going to stick it into 0. 7 so we're going to stick it into 0. 7 so we're going to stick it into 0. 7 and we're going to hit ok so here we go now we have estimated our so here we go now we have estimated our so here we go now we have estimated our arch two arch two arch two model we have that the two lags model we have that the two lags model we have that the two lags are statistically significant and here are statistically significant and here are statistically significant and here we have we have we have again the first um table this first part again the first um table this first part again the first um table this first part corresponds to the mean equation and the corresponds to the mean equation and the corresponds to the mean equation and the second part second part second part corresponds to the variance equation corresponds to the variance equation corresponds to the variance equation the way that you're going to write your the way that you're going to write your the way that you're going to write your model is first the mean equation we have model is first the mean equation we have model is first the mean equation we have the toronto stock exchange explained the toronto stock exchange explained the toronto stock exchange explained by a constant the outer regressive by a constant the outer regressive by a constant the outer regressive component component component and the moving average component and and the moving average component and and the moving average component and then we have the variance equation which then we have the variance equation which then we have the variance equation which is explained by the constant is explained by the constant is explained by the constant and the two lags that we have included and the two lags that we have included and the two lags that we have included in the in the arch in the in the arch in the in the arch specification as we can see the variance specification as we can see the variance specification as we can see the variance adds up to 0. 8 adds up to 0. 8 adds up to 0. 8 so remember that as a condition it so remember that as a condition it so remember that as a condition it cannot exceed the unit cannot exceed the unit cannot exceed the unit so alpha 1 plus alpha 2 they both so alpha 1 plus alpha 2 they both so alpha 1 plus alpha 2 they both make up to 0. 8 the persistence of the make up to 0. 8 the persistence of the make up to 0. 8 the persistence of the volatility is higher the closer volatility is higher the closer volatility is higher the closer it gets to one so in this case 0. 8 it gets to one so in this case 0. 8 it gets to one so in this case 0. 8 is relatively close to 1 so we can see is relatively close to 1 so we can see is relatively close to 1 so we can see then that the persistence of the then that the persistence of the then that the persistence of the volatility volatility volatility is quite high so now that we have is quite high so now that we have is quite high so now that we have estimated our arch to model estimated our arch to model estimated our arch to model we have a last step that is taking a we have a last step that is taking a we have a last step that is taking a look at the model diagnostics look at the model diagnostics look at the model diagnostics so the first thing will be the so the first thing will be the so the first thing will be the heteroskedasticity and what we need to heteroskedasticity and what we need to heteroskedasticity and what we need to do is to conduct do is to conduct do is to conduct the arch test again so what we should the arch test again so what we should the arch test again so what we should verify verify verify once we conduct the arch test again is once we conduct the arch test again is once we conduct the arch test again is that there are no arch effects that there are no arch effects that there are no arch effects because otherwise what your model then because otherwise what your model then because otherwise what your model then your result is suggesting you is that your result is suggesting you is that your result is suggesting you is that your specification is not appropriate your specification is not appropriate your specification is not appropriate that there still exists that there still exists that there still exists heteroskedasticity and that you should heteroskedasticity and that you should heteroskedasticity and that you should be including more large components be including more large components be including more large components and finally autocorrelation we have to and finally autocorrelation we have to and finally autocorrelation we have to look at the correlogram look at the correlogram look at the correlogram and there should be no significant lags and there should be no significant lags and there should be no significant lags the the probability of the q the the probability of the q the the probability of the q test should be bigger than 0. 05 so test should be bigger than 0. 05 so test should be bigger than 0. 05 so remember that remember that remember that the null hypothesis of this q test is the null hypothesis of this q test is the null hypothesis of this q test is that the residuals are white noise yeah that the residuals are white noise yeah that the residuals are white noise yeah so there is no autocorrelation so so there is no autocorrelation so so there is no autocorrelation so in order to confirm that hypothesis in order to confirm that hypothesis in order to confirm that hypothesis uh the p-value has to be bigger than uh the p-value has to be bigger than uh the p-value has to be bigger than point zero five point zero five point zero five so let's move into e-views and let's so let's move into e-views and let's so let's move into e-views and let's finish then with the model diagnostics finish then with the model diagnostics finish then with the model diagnostics to finish the model what we need to do to finish the model what we need to do to finish the model what we need to do then is to verify then is to verify then is to verify that there is no heteroskedasticity that there is no heteroskedasticity that there is no heteroskedasticity still present in this model still present in this model still present in this model so we're going to go into view residual so we're going to go into view residual so we're going to go into view residual diagnostics arch diagnostics arch diagnostics arch lm test again and we're going to include lm test again and we're going to include lm test again and we're going to include the two lags that we have used in our the two lags that we have used in our the two lags that we have used in our model and we want to verify now model and we want to verify now model and we want to verify now if there's still heteroskesticity so as if there's still heteroskesticity so as if there's still heteroskesticity so as you can see now the p-value is bigger you can see now the p-value is bigger you can see now the p-value is bigger than 0. 05 than 0. 05 than 0. 05 so what we are saying then is that there so what we are saying then is that there so what we are saying then is that there is no heteroskedasticity is no heteroskedasticity is no heteroskedasticity present still in this model so that's a present still in this model so that's a present still in this model so that's a good thing that's what we wanted good thing that's what we wanted good thing that's what we wanted and the last thing is checking for the and the last thing is checking for the and the last thing is checking for the autocorrelation autocorrelation autocorrelation the results have to be white noise so the results have to be white noise so the results have to be white noise so i'm going to go into racial diagnostics i'm going to go into racial diagnostics i'm going to go into racial diagnostics corelloram queue statistics and i'm corelloram queue statistics and i'm corelloram queue statistics and i'm going to leave the lag specification as going to leave the lag specification as going to leave the lag specification as default default default and as you can see in here in the oral and as you can see in here in the oral and as you can see in here in the oral correlation and partial autocorrelation correlation and partial autocorrelation correlation and partial autocorrelation is that there are no is that there are no is that there are no significant lags significant lags significant lags and furthermore if you can see here in and furthermore if you can see here in and furthermore if you can see here in the the the probability column remember that what i probability column remember that what i probability column remember that what i mentioned is that mentioned is that mentioned is that the q um the q test the null hypothesis the q um the q test the null hypothesis the q um the q test the null hypothesis is that is that is that my residuals are white noise and because my residuals are white noise and because my residuals are white noise and because the p-value is bigger than 0. 05 the p-value is bigger than 0. 05 the p-value is bigger than 0. 05 what we are saying then is that what we are saying then is that what we are saying then is that these residuals are white noise we these residuals are white noise we these residuals are white noise we cannot recheck the null hypothesis cannot recheck the null hypothesis cannot recheck the null hypothesis so this is very good as well so so this is very good as well so so this is very good as well so this arch model this arch 2 model this arch model this arch 2 model this arch model this arch 2 model satisfies the conditions that we have satisfies the conditions that we have satisfies the conditions that we have set for for arch models and set for for arch models and set for for arch models and something i would like to mention is something i would like to mention is something i would like to mention is that in this column the probability that in this column the probability that in this column the probability column you have values column you have values column you have values smaller than 0. 05 then your smaller than 0. 05 then your smaller than 0. 05 then your specification of the arch specification of the arch specification of the arch lags is not appropriate maybe you need lags is not appropriate maybe you need lags is not appropriate maybe you need to include more lags to include more lags to include more lags and once you perform again this and once you perform again this and once you perform again this correlogram accuse statistic test you're correlogram accuse statistic test you're correlogram accuse statistic test you're going to see then going to see then going to see then that all these values are going to be that all these values are going to be that all these values are going to be bigger than 0. 05 bigger than 0. 05 bigger than 0. 05 so that's something that you should so that's something that you should so that's something that you should consider is including more arch effects consider is including more arch effects consider is including more arch effects in the case that this column is telling in the case that this column is telling in the case that this column is telling you that there is you that there is you that there is autocorrelation the last thing that i autocorrelation the last thing that i autocorrelation the last thing that i would like to now is to display the would like to now is to display the would like to now is to display the variance of this model variance of this model variance of this model so i'm going to go into proc and make so i'm going to go into proc and make so i'm going to go into proc and make the large parian series it's the large parian series it's the large parian series it's going to tell if you how do you want to going to tell if you how do you want to going to tell if you how do you want to call it i would like to just call it of call it i would like to just call it of call it i would like to just call it of course conditional variance course conditional variance course conditional variance here we have the series then and we can here we have the series then and we can here we have the series then and we can view the graph view the graph view the graph of the conditional variance and here we of the conditional variance and here we of the conditional variance and here we have it have it have it so what we can do then with this so what we can do then with this so what we can do then with this conditional variance is we can plot it conditional variance is we can plot it conditional variance is we can plot it along with the toronto stock exchange along with the toronto stock exchange along with the toronto stock exchange i'm going to minimize this and i'm going i'm going to minimize this and i'm going i'm going to minimize this and i'm going to here i have the the series that we to here i have the the series that we to here i have the the series that we just just just generated with the tsx i'm going to open generated with the tsx i'm going to open generated with the tsx i'm going to open it as a group it as a group it as a group go into view graph and i would like to a go into view graph and i would like to a go into view graph and i would like to a last thing that is last thing that is last thing that is axis and scaling and i would like to axis and scaling and i would like to axis and scaling and i would like to have the conditional variance have the conditional variance have the conditional variance on the right scale axis sorry on the right scale axis sorry on the right scale axis sorry and here we can see that here we have and here we can see that here we have and here we can see that here we have our conditional variance graph our conditional variance graph our conditional variance graph and the toronto stock exchange and we and the toronto stock exchange and we and the toronto stock exchange and we can see how can see how can see how the variance has increased significantly the variance has increased significantly the variance has increased significantly in this moment where there is a big drop in this moment where there is a big drop in this moment where there is a big drop in the in the exchange that's going to in the in the exchange that's going to in the in the exchange that's going to be all the material for today be all the material for today be all the material for today so if you found this video useful i so if you found this video useful i so if you found this video useful i would like to invite you to subscribe to would like to invite you to subscribe to would like to invite you to subscribe to my channel my channel my channel since i'm going to be submitting many since i'm going to be submitting many since i'm going to be submitting many more tutorials more tutorials more tutorials about time series analysis my next video about time series analysis my next video about time series analysis my next video will be about guard models will be about guard models will be about guard models we're going to see how we can estimate we're going to see how we can estimate we're going to see how we can estimate guard models so if that's something guard models so if that's something guard models so if that's something you're interested about you're interested about you're interested about feel free to subscribe to the channel feel free to subscribe to the channel feel free to subscribe to the channel and as i mentioned and as i mentioned and as
