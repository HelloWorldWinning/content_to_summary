Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Introduction:**

*   The rise of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) necessitates accurate power output forecasting, especially for new DSGs.
*   Traditional approaches creating individual models for each DSG are not economically feasible in urban settings with numerous DSGs and limited historical data.

**II. Proposed Solution:**

*   This work adapts the attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model, named Solar TFT (STFT), for DSG forecasting.
*   The study uses data from 188 real-world operational DSGs to validate the generalization capabilities of the self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting.

**III. Experimental Results:**

*   STFT significantly outperforms the persistence model when applied to unseen DSGs, with improvements of 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively.
*   STFT also shows enhanced forecast accuracy compared to a specialized long short-term memory (LSTM) model, with 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% improvements at the same forecast horizons.

**IV. Trade-off and Weather Analysis:**

*   STFT's model architecture is more complex and computationally demanding than other deep learning models.
*   STFT performs particularly well during periods of high variability, such as weather transitions, exhibiting greater accuracy compared to reference models which often lag behind.

**Core Point:** The proposed Solar TFT model effectively addresses the challenge of forecasting power output for unseen distributed solar generators by leveraging the generalizable self-attention mechanism.

**Fundamental Point:** Adapting advanced models like TFT with self-attention allows accurate multi-step time series forecasting for distributed energy systems even with limited historical data and varying weather conditions.

**Overarching Framework:** The study explores a novel approach to DSG forecasting, focusing on model generalization to handle the challenges associated with widespread, small-scale solar generation, particularly in urban environments with limited data.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
