Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Core Ideas:**
    *   The artist used a chain-attached red camera to record movements, described metaphorically as a "vaginal engine."
    *   Initial intense heat, indicated by red coloring, was concentrated in internal organs.
    *   This heat shifted downwards through movement (shaking head, wagging tail).
    *   The heat eventually concentrated in lower legs, feet, hands and head, visualized as bright red extremities.

2.  **Core Point:** The artwork portrays a physiological transformation, visually represented through a shift of heat (red color) from internal organs to the extremities via movement.

3. **Fundamental Point:** The artwork uses the metaphor of a moving engine and heat transfer to depict a body's internal dynamic energy redistribution.

4.  **Overarching Framework:** The content describes an artistic performance that utilizes visual metaphors (red camera, vaginal engine) to represent a dynamic energy flow or physiological change within the body. This process is observed through the concentration and redistribution of heat (indicated by red color) through different body parts, which is influenced by movement.

Content:
 The artist recorded every movement as a vaginal engine using a chain for red camera. It's clear that from the shaking the head and, wagging the tail to dispel hard fire, the red areas originally, concentrated in the internal organs, gradually sink to the lower body. The lower legs and feet become warmer. The hands, feet and head of pure red, as key and blood being directed to the extremities.
