Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Core Ideas:**

*   **The "Saint" (圣) Analogy:** The content uses the concept of a "Saint" (圣) to represent a system or entity that has become dysfunctional. Initially, the Saint received excessive nourishment and experiences ("废的营养废的经验"), which, instead of helping, has now led to illness.
*   **The Problem of Neglect:** The Saint's "illness" is exacerbated because those who initially provided the resources neglect the Saint now, continuing to supply excessive "nutrients" (which now cause more harm).
*   **The Importance of "Skin" (皮):** The "skin" (皮) is a key element. It's described as being related to "earth" (土), which should control "water" (水). Healthy individuals have a balanced earth-water dynamic, but when unbalanced, it leads to problems.
*   **The Concept of "Nourishment" (养):** The Saint contains "nourishment" (养) that serves as a driving force. It needs to be carefully managed, residing "underneath" (浅在下面) and "within" the water (躲在水里面).
*   **The Role of the "Skin" in Water Regulation:** Healthy skin ("皮") can control the water (自水). This process is vital for the Saint's well-being.
*   **The "Opening and Closing" (开合) Principle:** The "nourishment" is linked to the "opening and closing" (开合) function within the Saint. A lack of "nourishment" will lead to inability to open and close.
*   **The Ineffectiveness of Traditional Approaches:** Conventional approaches like "co-enhancing medicine" (共兴的药) are dismissed in favor of focusing on addressing the skin's ability to regulate water.
*   **The "Skin's" Essential Role:** The skin's (皮) self-water control (自水) is the fundamental principle emphasized; this explains why traditional herbal medicine may not be needed.
*  **The Importance of "Self" :**  The term "self water" (自水) underscores the concept that the system can regulate itself, rather than relying on external interventions, as long as the skin can function effectively.

**II. Conclusion:**

*   **Core Point:** The core problem lies in the over-reliance on external inputs without ensuring proper internal regulation, particularly the skin's ability to manage water.
*  **Fundamental Point:** The skin's ability to regulate water (自水) is fundamental for the healthy operation of the "Saint" and is the cornerstone to focus on.

**III. Overarching Framework:**

The overarching framework is an analogy based on the concept of internal balance, using the metaphor of a “Saint” whose health is dictated by the skin's ability to regulate water, highlighting the importance of self-regulation over externally supplied interventions.
