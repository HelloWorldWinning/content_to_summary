Description:
**Summary:**

1. **Problem:**
    *   The rise of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) necessitates accurate power output forecasting.
    *   Traditional methods that create individual models for each DSG are impractical due to the numerous DSGs and lack of historical data.

2. **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Adapt a state-of-the-art, attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model for DSG forecasting.
    *   This adapted model, named Solar TFT (STFT), leverages the self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting.

3. **Validation:**
    *   STFT was tested on 188 real-world operational DSG datasets.
    *   STFT was evaluated on unseen DSGs without training data.

4. **Results:**
    *   STFT significantly improved forecast accuracy over the persistence model by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10, 20, and 30-minute forecasts respectively.
    *   Compared to the LSTM model, STFT improved forecast accuracy by 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% at the same forecast horizons.

5. **Considerations:**
    *   STFT has a higher computational cost than other deep learning models because of its complex architecture.
    *   The trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency needs to be considered for real-world applications.

6. **Weather Analysis:**
    *   STFT excels in high-variability periods, especially during weather transitions.
    *   Reference models face large errors during weather changes because of lagged predictions.

**Core Point:** The study successfully adapts the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model for accurate and generalizable multi-step forecasting of distributed solar generation, outperforming persistence and LSTM models.

**Fundamental Point:** The application of attention-based deep learning architectures can provide more accurate forecasts for distributed solar generation even with limited historical data.

**Overarching Framework:** This work demonstrates how an advanced deep learning model, specifically STFT, can be adapted and used for a common real-world problem of forecasting distributed solar generation by using the attention mechanism which is robust and generalizable across multiple DSGs, achieving a balance between accuracy and the resource constraints of model training.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
