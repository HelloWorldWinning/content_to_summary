Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Core Ideas:**

  *   **Problem:** Accurate power output forecasting for numerous small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) sites is challenging due to limited historical data and the infeasibility of training individual models for each DSG.
  *   **Solution:** Adapt a state-of-the-art attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model, named Solar TFT (STFT), to generalize to unseen DSGs without specific training data.
  *   **Methodology:** STFT is trained on 188 real-world operational DSG datasets and validated for multi-step time series forecasting.
  *   **Results:** STFT shows significant performance improvements over persistence models and even Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, especially at 10, 20, and 30-minute forecast horizons. STFT excels in capturing high variability in weather conditions, particularly during transition periods.
  *   **Trade-off:** While STFT achieves higher accuracy, it has a higher computational cost compared to other deep learning models.

**II. Core Point:**
The study demonstrates the feasibility of using a generalized self-attention-based model (STFT) to achieve accurate short-term power output forecasts for unseen distributed solar generation sites, overcoming the limitations of conventional methods that require site-specific historical data.

**III. Fundamental Point:**
The self-attention mechanism, as utilized in STFT, offers an effective approach for modeling the complex temporal dependencies in solar power generation, enabling accurate predictions for multiple distributed generation sites without individual training.

**IV. Overarching Framework:**
 The work is framed within the challenge of forecasting power output for numerous small-scale DSGs, proposing a transferable model (STFT) as a practical alternative to traditional, data-heavy approaches, with a focused evaluation of forecast accuracy and computational trade-offs.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
