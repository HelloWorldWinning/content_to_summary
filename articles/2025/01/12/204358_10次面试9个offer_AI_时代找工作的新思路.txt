Hey, I'm Zake Zhang. I used to work in ByteDance and OnePlus in Shenzhen for more than 6 years. When I was 30, I quit my job and came to Sweden to study. Now I'm doing the same AI-related work in Northern Europe. So this morning The weather was very good and the sun shone directly into the house. This was also the first time I recorded a video in this new home and met everyone. I wanted to share it with everyone. In fact, I had written the draft for this video in May and June, but I kept posting it. Being lazy means not being accepted. This may be very valuable to everyone, that is, how to find AI-related jobs in an AI environment and successfully get an offer. Because in May and June this year, I actually interviewed about 10 companies. I got offers from 9 of the companies that are developing large AI models and overseas applications. Although I have n’t worked in a large Internet company for 2 years, I still think a 90% interview pass rate is quite high. From May to June, I have shared this method with some of my classmates. They also found good job opportunities using this method. So I really want to share this with you. I'm going to share with you the better part. I've never seen anyone else share this idea on the Internet. This is why it works so well because it will set you apart from other interviewers. First of all, we Let's think about what you think is the most difficult part of the interview process. Some people think that some of the questions asked by the interviewer are difficult, but from my experience of interviewing or interviewing others, in fact, every time I ask a question, I don't I hope the interviewer can give me a perfect answer. I even say that many questions don’t actually have a correct answer. I just hope to hear the interviewer present his ideas in a logical and clear way and that the answer is convincing. Can you impress the interviewer or the colleagues in the department you are going to work with? In this case, it depends entirely on improvisation and improvisation. In fact, we can actually mention our past work experience, the books we have read, and the projects we have done. Some relatively high-quality answers, but in a scenario like an interview, you will inevitably make some omissions. It is difficult to give a perfect answer that can reflect your thinking and ability. So today I want to share with you a way It allows you to answer all the questions you might be asked during the interview. You can predict and prepare the answers in advance. Are you willing to try this method? In a word, choose a very niche group of people and demand pain points in a field that you know and love very well and try to make a product. Or service, it can be very simple with only one function and can only do one thing, but such an MVP and Demo can allow you to attract all the attention of the interviewer during the interview because for the AI ​​industry, this industry is very new and It changes every day. Instead of discussing your past work experience that is not particularly relevant to AI or has a low relevance, it is better to directly discuss the AI ​​project you are currently working on and what you think about it. At the same time, it will satisfy the AI company. The first of the three most important points for recruiting is passion for AI. Why do you want to get involved in AI at this point in time? Is it because this industry seems hot and you want to make more money? Or is it because you just Do you really need to find a job now, or are you curious about AI and want to explore it? The second point is the ability to learn quickly, because if you pay attention to all the news in the industry, new product changes, and research papers You will find that it is updated periodically. It 's too frequent and too fast, so you need efficient and continuous learning ability and methods. The third point is your stability, your personality and the integration of the team. This point will be communicated with you continuously during the interview. The reason why I recommend you to do a project of your own, even if it is very simple, is because it can push all the three things I mentioned above to the maximum value Max because if you have One or more of your own projects can be discussed. First, you have fully demonstrated your enthusiasm. You did not express it in words but through your own actions. Second, you have the ability to learn quickly because every time you do a project, you It can be very simple, so you only need one or two weeks, or a month or two for a larger project. You have also proved to the interviewer that I have the ability to complete a complete software from start to finish in a fast learning process. The third point is your personality. When you are developing this software, you will have many problems. Your users will also ask you many questions. You will also be questioned by your classmates and friends. So you already have If you have constructed a set of answers to such questions, you will become very confident when expressing yourself. I think confidence, especially in verbal expression during an interview, The confidence in your thinking reflected in your conversation is one of the most important qualities for interviewers and companies. Here I want to emphasize again that the confidence I am talking about is to present your answers with humility and a learning attitude, and to be persuasive and confident. This kind of self-confidence is not the kind of arrogance without a mind or bottom line. So everyone must distinguish it. Then let's look at the interview process again. In fact, you turn this hour from a passive, unpredictable and uncontrollable process into all You are talking about the topics you are most familiar with and the problems you are most familiar with. You show and share with him. Then, I would like to share with you step by step how we can find a field that we are very good at and have a niche in and in this field. What can you do to finally get an interview invitation for a job? First of all, choose a field that you are very passionate about, understand and excel in. I think this big theme and framework is also the most important part, regardless of whether you have worked before. I think his method is very simple. Just choose the AI ​​leaders and unicorns that you think you like the most or the hottest companies in the industry and see if they have appeared in recent interviews, podcasts, interviews or articles. Reveal some of what they will do in the future Or they imagine what will happen in a year from now, and then choose a niche demand that they love within this big framework and direction to explore and try. What is the best thing to do? It is better to have some relevance to what these big companies do, so that every time they update the model iteration, they can make your product better. In this process, I think everyone should not set themselves The limitation is that not all AI applications must help you save money and time to be good and meaningful. Some fun and meaningless ones are also worth trying and can reflect your personality as a person. It is very interesting. For example, I saw a very interesting project on Reddit some time ago. It means that you can take a photo of every meal you eat and upload it to his platform, and he can use the big model to To judge and predict how many farts you need to fart every day and whether you will fart at a certain time in each period. For me, I have always been very interested in the interaction of images, videos and multimodal human-computer interaction. Interest, especially for the creators, because I make videos and post them myself. So some of the projects that we have been looking at before and are currently looking at are related in this way. The second point is that after we have such a framework and direction, what can we do? I think a very critical one is that when the network is so convenient We can collect a lot of pain points and needs from all over the world at home. For example, I often visit Reddit, which is similar to the domestic forums and forums. In this place, they will discuss a lot of things they want to accomplish. The demands of this matter, and someone has made such software through AI to help everyone better understand the needs on Reddit. Similarly, the comment area is also a particularly good place to collect user needs. For example, the popular products on major e-commerce platforms In the comment section below, take a look at what people like and dislike about him and where he can do better. Maybe your project is to make a domestic version of the user demand collector. We did this project last year. I am very interested in stable I have very limited knowledge of diffusion and ComfyUI controlnet, but when I was working on that project for about a month, it would force me to read various tutorials and papers during that time to understand its principles. What is the upper limit of this technology? I think the knowledge you gain and learn is far more valuable than spending 9. 9 or 19. 9 yuan to buy an AI product manager primer or interview guide. The Demo and MVP we made don't have to be perfect. They just need to be able to do one thing. They just need to have one or two functions to run. If the interviewer wants to see it, you can vote. You can show him the screen and you know that if you invest more time, energy and money, it can get better. It is enough to have such a plan and roadmap for future products. This is also Andrew, one of the earliest researchers of OpenAI. Karpathy recommends a learning method on his own YT channel, which is to learn and understand a new thing in a project-based way. Moreover, now we have Cursor and Bolt, which can be used to understand it through natural language. The cost of this thing is lower than any other period when you can deploy it, click and interact with it. The last point I want to share with you today is how to We have such a small product After the small demo, can I get an interview opportunity? Because this is also the biggest problem that other students encounter when I share with them. I don’t even have an interview opportunity. How can I present all the things I have done? So here we I follow a very simple principle, which is that I want the whole universe to know. So compared to applying for a large number of projects, I now recommend that you make videos and write blogs about how you can complete the project in, for example, 30 days or 7 days. Such a small demo attempt is to determine the needs, find the problems, produce solutions, make such a product, and bring it to the user to let him use it. After he gives you feedback, you can optimize the software. You share the whole process. For the structure of the video or article, you can refer to all the 30-day challenge series videos I shared in the past. If you also have more than 20 videos, all of them are small demos of various AI-related scenarios and user tests. After the communication, you will gather some insights into the industry, which will make you a very hot candidate. The above is the strategy of applying for a large number of jobs. Our application for a large number of jobs does not mean applying for a large number of jobs, but I will apply for it. Put it on social media for the whole world to see. What's underneath? We are going to talk about precise delivery. There may be some differences between China and abroad. In foreign countries, people may use LinkedIn or email more often. You can find the direct contact information of the other party's recruiter, his email, his LinkedIn. His Inmail message Any of this kind of method you must cherish the opening sentence briefly introduce who I am and what I do, and the second sentence is what is the project I am working on and what are the things in it and you It is very relevant to what you are interested in doing, and you can take a look at the document I made for this project. In this document, there will be more detailed information about your project, that is, why you want to do this thing. What is your background? Who is the target group you serve? What insights into the industry did you discover when you communicated with users? In China, it is actually very difficult to communicate through email and LinkedIn, so I recommend that you directly participate in offline activities. If a big shot or someone from your favorite company in the industry is participating in a technology event, you must actively try to participate in it, whether it is online or offline, and try to establish a connection with this person. Just give a brief self-introduction of what you are doing and what is related to their company and send them a document. That's enough. That's all I want to share with you today. I think if you do these three things well, maybe you can get an interview and get the final offer. If you don't get the final offer, it doesn't matter. But you have experience in these projects. It is difficult for others to take away your knowledge, experience and ability. Then maybe you can make some money or even start a business by doing these projects. No one can say for sure. I hope today's video can help you in the interview process or Find more inspiration and enlightenment for your job search. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me in the comment section below or in the background. I am Zhang Zihe Zake. See you next time. Bye.
