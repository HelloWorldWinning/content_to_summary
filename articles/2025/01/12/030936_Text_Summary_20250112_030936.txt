Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   The rise of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) requires accurate, site-adaptive forecasting models.
    *   Traditional individual models for each DSG are not feasible due to the high number of DSGs and lack of historical data.
    
2. **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Adapt the attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model for DSG forecasting, named Solar TFT (STFT).
    *   Validate STFT's generalizability using 188 real-world DSG datasets.
    
3.  **Results:**
    *   STFT significantly outperforms the persistence model, with improvements of 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively.
    *   STFT shows superior accuracy compared to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% improvements at the same forecast horizons.
    *   STFT performs exceptionally well during high variability periods, particularly weather transitions.

4.  **Trade-offs:**
    *   STFT has a more complex architecture, resulting in a higher computational cost.
    *   The trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications.

**Core Point:** The study successfully adapts and validates the Temporal Fusion Transformer model for accurate multi-step forecasting of distributed solar generation, demonstrating its generalizability and performance in scenarios lacking historical data.

**Fundamental Point:** By adapting the attention-based TFT model, the study establishes a scalable approach for accurate, site-adaptive solar power forecasting, addressing the limitations of traditional methods in the context of distributed generation.

**Overarching Framework:**

The content establishes an approach of adapting the Temporal Fusion Transformer to enhance the accuracy and scalability of forecasting power generation in distributed solar systems, highlighting the superior performance of the adapted model compared to other models and emphasizing the trade-off of computational cost, thus laying a pathway for future model selection decisions.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
