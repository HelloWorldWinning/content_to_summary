Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   The rise of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) necessitates accurate forecasting models.
    *   Developing individual models for each DSG is impractical due to the lack of historical data and the large number of DSGs.
2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Adapt the attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model for DSG forecasting (Solar TFT or STFT).
    *   Validate the generalizability of the self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting with real-world DSG data.
3.  **Results:**
    *   STFT shows significant improvements over the persistence model in multi-step forecasting, with enhancements of 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10, 20, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively, when applied to unseen DSGs without training data.
    *   STFT also outperforms a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, with 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% improvement at the respective time horizons.
    *   STFT is particularly effective in high-variability conditions, especially during weather transitions, where it reduces lagged predictions common in reference models.
4.  **Trade-offs:**
    *   STFT is more complex, and thus computationally more costly, than other deep learning models, requiring careful consideration of this trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.
5.  **Weather Condition Analysis:**
    *   STFT demonstrates its superior forecasting capability in various weather conditions, most notably in its ability to capture fluctuations during weather transitions.

**Core Point:**
This study demonstrates that the adapted attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer model is effective for multi-step ahead forecasting for unseen distributed solar generation.

**Fundamental Point:**
The generalizability of the self-attention mechanism in the temporal fusion transformer enables accurate forecasting across multiple distributed solar generation sites, even without individual historical data.

**Overarching Framework:**
The overarching framework is the application of advanced deep learning, specifically the TFT model with its self-attention mechanisms, to address the practical challenge of predicting power outputs for distributed solar generation in urban areas, focusing on situations where traditional approaches are ineffective due to data scarcity and scale.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
