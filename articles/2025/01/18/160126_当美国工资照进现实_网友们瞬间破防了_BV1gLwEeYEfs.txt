    *   They feel the system is unfair and that their efforts are not being rewarded.

2.  **Observations of Chinese Living Standards (Red Note):**

    *   They express shock at the affordability of groceries and the cost of living (rent, utilities etc.) in China compared to the US.
    *   They are astonished by the quality of Chinese cities, transportation infrastructure and perceived level of well-being of people in China.
    *   This contrasts with their experiences in America, leading to disillusionment.
    *  The speaker notes that the experience on Red Note is causing a culture shock on the American side.

3.  **Disillusionment with American Propaganda and Government:**

    *   They criticize the American government and leadership (Biden, Trump) for failing to address the struggles of ordinary citizens.
     *   They perceive a propaganda effort that has falsely painted a negative picture of other countries, like China, which they now see as potentially having a higher quality of life and better systems.

4.  **Call to Action & Desire for Change:**

    *   They call for Americans to "wake up", stand up, and fight for a better system and quality of life, wanting all to "eat".
    * They express a desire to move to China.

**Core Point:** The speaker's personal struggles, contrasting experiences from a Chinese social media app, and disillusionment with American promises drives a call for American citizens to recognize and demand change in their living standards.

**Fundamental Point:**  Exposure to different perspectives challenges long-held beliefs, revealing the gap between American rhetoric and its citizens’ realities and inciting a desire for change.

**Overarching Framework:** The content presents a journey from personal frustration to a broader critique of American society and a call for social change, fueled by a comparative analysis of living standards gleaned from a Chinese social media platform.

 No, because FUCK you, America, for making me work for fucking jobs! MORE JOBS! Why am I college? In rural fucking Tennessee, and I can barely pay my own fucking rent! And I- And I'm taking 19 credit hours on top of those poor fucking jobs, and I still can't graduate on time, and I still can't graduate in early, even though I'm taking 21 credit hours next semester! I'm not gonna be a bad person. It's not fucking fair! It's not fucking fair anymore! It's never been fair, not in my lifetime! And will it ever be fair? No, because I'm a woman in America! Oh my god! I just want to live in peace, America! And I will one day, probably somewhere fucking else! Anyways, look how cute my nails are! Born a random and watched in all these grocery calls when you realize why Chinese food have so many vegetables and so many ingredients and why I rarely make it because I'm always like, I can't afford to take a mortgage out to make dinner, but watch and know, find your groceries and see how utterly affordable it is made me realize a lot because I know what you're gonna say, what's we should move lived in other countries and be traveled the world all the time? Why didn't you realize other places are more affordable? I understand other places are more affordable. Even when I lived in Japan, groceries were more affordable, but they were nowhere near as affordable as the food that I'm watching already know. Because tell me why someone had 12 bags of groceries and it was only $32. Wow, I went to the grocery store earlier today and had two bags and one of the bags you just filled was vintage and it was still $61.54. $61.54. I feel like Eleanor was to realize that this is the bad place. I've been scrolling red note for hours, and these grocery calls, you guys, this is why they wanted us to hate all of them. We are the third world country. They can afford food. They can actually afford to buy groceries. Their groceries are cheap. What are we doing here? What I'm seeing is a ton of culture shock from the American side especially. The Chinese definitely think, well, why this fuck, which we are? Like damn y'all are wild, but from our side, it's like seeing their grocery hauls, which make ours look pathetic. It's seeing their educational opportunities and what they're talking about and work opportunities. It's seeing their cities. And a lot of people, I remember when I first really started looking at Chinese cities was like, yo, we do not have cities like this. In the United States, these cities are absolutely next level, along with their transportation infrastructure. And all of these people seem to be pretty fucking happy. And they're starting to realize Americans how heavily propagandized our entire existence is a bit. And that everything our government tells us makes us greater than everywhere else is absolute and utter bullshit. That these people aren't just miserable and all of China can't be summed up by communism and human rights violations. That their population seems to be from our eyes living pretty fucking well and not struggling anywhere near as much as we are. The fact that they don't have much of a homeless problem, that they actually give things like temporary housing, they don't tell us this type of shit about these countries for a reason. This is the type of shit that terrifies governments and it's happening, en masse, en. The damage may already be done, like yo, y'all told us that this is the best country in the world. Why are we struggling so much more than these countries you told us for shitholes? Super fascinating what's happening right now. This... I'm moving to China, what the fuck? Somebody can pay $69 a month for water, electricity, internet, and their apartment. And it's a two bedroom with living room kitchen, two balconies in a middle-sized washroom and the internet is one gig. That's like one month of rent, sorry, one day of rent in a one bedroom here in California. I could work one day and cover all of my expenses. I could work one, twelve hour day at five US dollars and cover rent for the fucking month and utilities, you gotta be kidding me! Why are we not revolting in America right now? I'm sorry, has anyone else been on Red Note? Have you been on Red Note yet because have you seen the grocery haul on Red Note? Have you seen the way they live, their homes, their quality of life? You know, I was always told that America is just home of the free land of the brave. I was a child that was panned into my head that we're the greatest country in the world and being coming from incredible poverty. It's not like I ever had a chance to explore that fact as an adult. I know it's bullshit. I don't think we're the worst country in the world. We are by far the greatest. However, I do think it's time for us to be more uncomfortable than we already are. But we can afford groceries, can't pay our rent. Just be a little more uncomfortable, delete your meta apps. We need to start affecting some change for real in this country. Being on the Red Note and seeing their quality of life is shocking. Hey, okay, so this Red Book thing. The wildest part about this entire shift to Red Book is that US citizens now are connected to Chinese citizens. The entire US propaganda machine that makes us afraid of them, it makes us think that their lives are shitty or in this authoritarian realm, it's just completely shattered. It's broken. Not only that, but someone was just talking about watching a grocery haul on Red Book and how they couldn't believe how much groceries these Chinese citizens had because they can afford groceries. It's a fuck you Biden, fuck you Trump, fuck you American government. I don't know how many of you guys are going and going and going. I know you gotta be at the same level of mental health as me. Every day it's something new between the fucking news and the fucking stupid Biden and stupid Trump. And as this country's fucked, every day we're spending more and more money, none of us are getting ahead. The rich people are the ones that are fucking getting ahead. I'm tired of struggling. I'm done everything I can. I'm trying to be a good man. I take care of my daughter. I take care of my wife. The best I can. I can't keep going. Every day it's something new. And then on top of that, as if you're not trying to spend money you have to, fucking everything's expensive. I want a painting company I still can't fucking make it. I'm fucking trying man. I can't look at my time. I want to know I'm feeling it. I'm falling into it. I'm falling into it. Everybody wake up. It's time to stand up. It's time to be tired of this. It's our turn to fucking eat. I want to eat. I want my family to eat. I want you guys to eat. Stand up. Let's go. Stand up. Let's fucking eat. I'm tired.
