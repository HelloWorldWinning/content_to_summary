Today I want to talk to you about the phenomenal changes that mobile phones and social media have had on our brains and our mental states. In fact, I have read about this topic many times in books before. At that time, I intuitively thought that the impact of this kind of mobile phone would be like when cars first came out. People may not have learned how to control the government and they don’t know how to regulate this new thing, but as time goes by, it will be like It's the same as a driver's license. You have to be at what age to pass the driver's license test before you can drive. But until now, for the use of mobile phones, major platforms such as YouTube and Netflix have launched children's accounts. However, I have not seen the government or education departments take a more specific approach to this issue. Improvement measures This is why I want to make this episode today, so I want to put the conclusion first: when everyone has a mobile phone that can connect to the whole world, everyone will no longer care so much about reality. It’s about the people and things around you, and the community (media) seems to have promised everyone that you can more easily connect with friends and build fans. But in fact, the more people live, the more lonely they become, the more depressed, anxious, and unhappy they are. I want to start from 2007. On January 9, 2007, Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, introduced his new product iPhone to the world. Before that, Apple’s iPod was already a hot product, so Jobs Burse told everyone that this was an iPod with a larger screen and touch controls. Looking back now, the first iPhone was really a tool box. It could surf the Internet, play phone calls, play music, and also had a flashlight function. But it was The next year Apple launched its own App Store. It was like saying to technology companies around the world that you can now develop software and I will make it easy for my users to download it. However, these technology companies still used it at the beginning. With the old thinking, they wanted to sell software for maybe 2 dollars or 5 dollars a set. But they soon discovered that these mobile phone users only downloaded free software, so this also led technology companies to change their They thought about the strategy and thought about how they could make money? They thought that I could sell ads. Then they tried many products and finally found a software that everyone loved the most and used it so much that they lost track of time. It was a software that could be released freely. A platform for content, and other people can also like, comment and share this work, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, these companies can be considered as useful platforms for everyone to stay on, and technology companies will develop them. Providing advertising space so that owners can place ads, this is how a product line worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year was opened. The change in the direction of this software was a big key because we originally thought we had spent tens of thousands of dollars to buy it. It is a super tool that can help us work and help us search for certain information in a more timely manner. However, because the business model of software companies has changed, they try their best to let you spend more time on it, so we started from the consumption of electronic products. Our attention has been sold to advertisers by these technology companies. Therefore, in addition to the obvious deprivation of a lot of time, the price behind this change is that our mental health is deteriorating. According to statistics, everyone will have periods of depression and low ebbs. Teenagers also have these tendencies, so it is normal to have these tendencies. However, it would be a bit strange if the values ​​of various mental health problems increase within a certain period of time. This period is from 2012 to 2015. At this time, various countries conducted various types of tests for teenagers, including junior high schools, high schools, and universities. For example, in the depression section of the test, these students will be asked, "Do you suddenly feel right? " Is something that you were interested in in the past suddenly no longer interesting to you? Or ask them if you have experienced long-term sadness, emptiness and depression. These questions are clinical indicators to determine whether a person is severely depressed, and these questions The score of the indicator has almost doubled for girls from 2012 to 2015, while for boys it has increased by about 20%. There are other questions, such as asking teenagers, do you think life is meaningless? This ratio was also in 2012 Then it skyrocketed, or when asked about the status of some campuses, they would ask these students, do you often feel lonely and alienated in school? This proportion is also increasing, and some people actually don't care about these reports. They raise questions and think that To say that these numbers are going up today may just be because modern young people are more conscious about their mental state. After all, these mental health problems are caused by students who evaluate their own scores. In response to such questions, sociologists actually They also produced a report on "non-suicidal self-injurious behavior" because sociologists believe that it is indeed possible that these teenagers are more self-conscious about themselves, so they may make the numbers soar. But if today we go to the point where we have to cut ourselves off, This cannot be explained by being a little conscious about hurting your wrist, and this report also shows that since 2010, the number of adolescent females has increased by 188%, and the number of males has increased by 48%. This situation occurs in all countries without exception, so this Scholars can't help but wonder what kind of huge reason causes this phenomenon? The most relevant data that can be found so far is what proportion of teenagers have smartphones and how much time teenagers spend a day online. In other words, if you have smart phones, The more people use mobile phones and the longer everyone spends time online, the more serious the mental state problems of these teenagers will become. And why is this? Let’s start with the brain. Our brain development is completely different from other animals, like chimpanzees. Chimpanzees grow steadily from birth until they reach sexual maturity. Their brains will be fully developed and then they can start reproducing. But humans will wait a little longer. Our brains have developed to 90% of their full size by about two years old. So normally, if If we want to quickly enter the reproduction period today, we should rush to 100% as soon as possible. However, we will stop for 7 to 10 years at this time. The 10 years of pause is not an evolutionary flaw but an evolutionary flaw. Wisdom: Looking at the creatures on the earth, human beings are not the strongest, the most reproducing, or the smartest. The reason why we can still survive on the earth today is that we can pass on our wisdom and technology to the next generation. Accumulated in this way, we will also cooperate with each other to complete a big project. So the 10 years left out seem to be talking about human beings. Don’t advance to the reproduction stage so quickly. I hope you can learn certain skills before you reproduce. Only those who have the ability to face such a conclusion are not talking nonsense because brain-related scientists also discovered that our brains will perform two important actions in the past 10 years: pruning and strengthening. Let’s talk about pruning first. It means to remove some skills that you don't use because the brain is about efficiency. If there are certain skills that you never use in the past 10 years, it would be the smartest thing for me to cut them off so that you don't have to in the future. Spending your brain power on these unnecessary skills has this characteristic in language learning. If a Japanese child once lived in an English environment before the age of 12, it doesn’t matter whether he can speak it in the future or not. If he continues to live here and he grows up, he will be able to distinguish the difference between the pronunciation of "light" and "right". But in comparison, a Japanese child who has always heard Japanese will have difficulty distinguishing the two. So what can we say? For those who heard English pronunciation when they were young, their brains retained this skill, but for those who have not heard it, their brains cut off this skill without authorization. This is pruning. Next, when we talk about strengthening functions, there are some in our brains. There are tens of billions of neurons. When we are thinking about something or doing an action today, certain neurons will transfer information to each other and work together. What the brain is doing is strengthening the neurons that can work together. The closer they are to each other, the faster they will transmit information. In fact, the advantage we can look for in ourselves is, have you ever noticed that if you were exposed to a certain sport and learned it when you were a child, you would go to it when you grow up? Returning to school is faster. In other words, if you have learned piano for a while when you were a child, you will be able to pick it up quickly if you want to go back to school when you grow up. This is because the strengthening of the brain helps. It allows us to do the things we often do in these ten years throughout our lives. If you have a certain degree of mastery, these two functions will continue to run until you are about 12 or 13 years old. After that, these two functions can be activated, but the effect will not be as strong as it has been in the past ten years, so then we will We have the ability to reproduce after adolescence, but have we really learned the ability in these ten years? I want to say that the emergence of smart phones and social media has not only wasted the best period of this decade, but has even become a lifetime. The word "burden" is quite heavy, so I want to slowly talk about it. Today, what a growing child needs most is to play freely in the physical world, because playing is the most effective way to learn necessary skills. I give an example. For example, after a child comes to the park, if he wants to get along well with everyone, he must control himself. For example, if he wants to play on the slide today, he has to queue up, or if he likes to play on the swings today, but As long as there is someone waiting behind him, he will have to give up his seat in ten minutes. These things will make him have to learn to control his emotions and his desires, because if he does not follow the rules today, he will be hated by other children. You can't play with them or even be squeezed out again. As long as we play with other people in the physical world, we must learn the skill of "synchronicity". For example, let's say you accidentally killed your neighbor while playing today. Did you notice his expression at that moment when he knocked you down? Was he in pain or did he feel nothing at all? Did you squat down to see his injury? And what was his expression after you apologized to him? Is there any change? Each of our actions will cause a certain reaction from the other person, and his reaction will also affect our reaction. This "synchronicity" technique actually helps us interact with friends in the future, just like You may have told a joke to a colleague today, but the other person frowned and looked very angry. Can you detect from other clues on his body whether this person was joking with you or was he really angry? Then you How should you respond to him after you notice it? This "synchronicity" skill is basically used every day when we grow up. When playing as a child, we first lay the foundation. Next, I want to talk about the most important thing. The thing is that the price we have to bear when withdrawing from a community in the physical world is very high, so we will try our best to maintain the relationship. Just imagine when a person came to junior high school today and he met a group of friends not long after school started. They also love baseball. So they played ball together after class and slept together during class. But after one semester, he found that two of them seemed to be showing off and he didn't want to chat with him. At this time, this person would definitely feel that these two people were very annoying. Oh, don't tell me what happened. If he wants to understand at this time, he must step forward to break the ice. This requires going through a lot of uncomfortable feelings, but this is a very important skill that must be learned, because in the future, There are too many moments like this in life where we need to communicate on our own to resolve misunderstandings. At this time, the limitations of real life become a help because we may feel that there are only a few people in the whole grade and I can't do it. I will maintain this terrible relationship with these people for the next three years, so even though I am very reluctant today, I will still have the courage to ask if it is because of what I said and did that you have to avoid me. Because we know that maintaining a good relationship in this area is more important than temporary discomfort. To put it simply, the cost of withdrawing from a community in the physical world is very high, so everyone is forced to learn to communicate, apologize, Reviewing these are things that an adult must learn. But after coming to the Internet world, it is difficult for us to learn all the above. Let me explain carefully that the advantage of the Internet world is that it transcends the limitation of distance. So assuming it is the problem just now, but it happened On the Internet, you were in a club that talked about baseball, but I don’t know why the people in the club stopped replying to you. It felt like they were avoiding you. What would we think at this time? Of course, we can still go through it. I feel comfortable asking them what happened, but the online world has given me an easier way. We can choose to leave this club and find the next one. Anyway, the online world is so big that I can find it wherever I look. That’s the problem. The root cause is because the cost of withdrawing from the community in the online world is too small. We don’t even consider how troublesome it is to have a misunderstanding stuck there. Because today, as long as I change my account, I have done something wrong before. If it doesn’t affect me at all, I don’t have to deal with it. Then we can’t learn from this process how to become a member of a community. What should I do? That’s not all. Because of the emergence of mobile phones and social media. It divides children's play time. Although we can also play online games and send messages with real friends on the Internet, this does not help synchronization. When we stabbed each other today, the other party may have been so angry that his face was distorted. I dropped it but still typed it and said "I'm fine" and then you didn't know you were in trouble. Then we can't learn courtesy or self-control. Just like if you left a disgusting message in the community, you won't either. Therefore, being teased by classmates or being hated by them is only part of the above. I think what is even more terrifying is that social media will teach these teenagers how the world works. For example, it is common for some people in the community to Details of details are all shared on the Internet. The breakfast after waking up is the first limited time post. The emotion after eating is a Threads post. After starting work, I share a selfie in the cafe. I ate extra large beef noodles for lunch and left a message saying that I have been recently. Gaining weight will become the way teenagers think the world works. After they can use mobile phones freely, they may imitate the practices of these influential figures. Let me give a few examples. Some people are very popular on the Internet. There are a lot of voices, a lot of likes, and a lot of tweets, but what they are doing may be insulting, stepping on other people's bodies, or doing some inexplicable behavior to attract attention. If you were an adult today, you would use a third party. Viewed as a joke, but for a student whose brain is learning how to be an adult, he will learn from these people as idols, so we can see that these teenagers do not understand the online world at all. As if it is another world, they simply live in the online world. They will spend a lot of time editing a photo and then upload it. If there are not 50 likes within half an hour after uploading, he will delete it and post it later. This is a It’s a terrible operation, but I’ve seen many people do it. And many of the actions of these people in the physical world are just to get attention in the online world. For example, it’s not because he chose to eat in this restaurant today. They want to eat and chat with friends, but because checking in at this restaurant and sending photos is a cool behavior on the Internet. In short, for their brains, the way the world judges whether a person has value is based on his online presence. Do you have a voice, likes and comments on the road? This matter is more obvious for girls. I will talk about two key points. The first is because women’s appearance is more easily scrutinized on the Internet. The advantage of this matter is of course that there are those appearances. Good-looking people can earn a lot of fans and wealth by relying on their appearance, but there are also many disadvantages. For example, some people will leave messages under photos saying that their eyes are ugly and their teeth are a bit crooked. Whether these comments have ulterior motives or Being completely unintentional must be very hurtful to the person involved, which is also some of the sources of appearance anxiety. The second thing women pursue is communion. In the scientific community, when it comes to the psychological differences between men and women, they are usually careful not to mention boys easily. How do girls compare, but there are a few things that they agree on. For example, they found that men care more about autonomy in the community, which means self-improvement and the display of self-worth, while women care more about inclusion. In other words, can they be accepted by a larger community? These two points can basically explain why women are more affected by social media. Because on the Internet, if we don’t get enough likes today, what will happen? When friends leave messages, it seems to be saying that I am not liked by others and that I am not accepted by them, so this need cannot be met. In addition, their appearance and figure are more likely to be maliciously commented on, which is a feeling of not being accepted. It will keep coming, so in the report mentioned at the beginning of the video, the negative impact of social media on women is more serious than that on men. These are the current impacts of mobile phones and social media, so I can do that too. I will tell you very frankly that I used to think that this matter was none of my business. I thought that it was their life issue and they had to face it on their own. But then one thing I thought of was that this group of people grew up surrounded by mobile phones. They may later become my colleagues, become the children of good friends, become my brother's children, etc. And what if these children are also the ones who passively accept it? Because as far as the parent is concerned, he may just watch everyone do this. When a child makes a quarrel, I give him a mobile phone. After he goes to school, I give him his own smart phone. But I never thought that the shock caused by this would be so exaggerated. So I want to share with you the last part of my conclusion today. Let me share a few suggestions that I think are not too difficult in practice. First, let’s talk about the suggestions for parents. The first is to fully participate in the interaction. If a parent is always playing with his mobile phone and replying to messages when traveling with his child, then the child will definitely From this experience, you will feel that the mobile phone is more important than me. Do you think your child will be able to concentrate on getting along with you after he has the ability to own a mobile phone? Second, return the mobile phone to the tool itself rather than a toy that fills rest time because Children will definitely learn the lifestyle from their original family. For example, our family never watches TV when eating. My parents have fixed exercise habits, so when I grew up, I naturally followed this lifestyle without any effort. So as a parent, I think we should let our children see that there are actually more choices during their rest time. For example, on weekends, you can arrange to go hiking or play with friends in the park. On weekdays, after returning home, everyone can get together to have dinner and chat. What happened that day? Instead of taking out the phone to slide when there is a free time every day. The third one is to find other parents. For example, you can make an agreement with other parents that we will meet at the Riverside Park on the weekend afternoon to make the children feel like saying It is a great thing to go outdoors and have friends to play with. This not only allows them to learn to communicate and control their emotions, etc. , but also allows them to understand that the happiness brought by real life is completely different from the happiness brought by the online world. At the level of targeting the users themselves, that is, when you discover that your own behavior has been controlled by this community, you will start eating spaghetti until it is cold because you want to get more likes. I think it is targeted at this kind of people. I would like to give a few suggestions. The first is to turn on Do Not Disturb mode all day long. This is the most effective way to quit smoking because it can reverse the relationship between you and your mobile phone. You turn it on and now it won't light up or bother you anymore because of Do Not Disturb mode. You want to pick it up now because you want to play. This ensures that when you don't want to be disturbed today, you won't be disturbed at all. Turn off your phone when you are engaged in your favorite activity. You will find that it is really relaxing during this time without the interference of your phone. You don’t have to think about whether anyone has responded to you. You also don’t have to think about the salad I just made. You can upload it to a limited edition. You will only enjoy this activity 100% now. This experience can remind yourself whether I live for real experience or do I want to live in the online world? The third suggestion is not to start a business. TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube accounts, but you can watch them because the most powerful thing about social media is that it will understand what you like to watch and then continue to feed you very homogeneous videos. So if you haven’t created an account today Even if you can turn on the incognito mode in the browser, these platforms have no way of knowing who you are and what you like to watch, so they can't push some highly attractive content to you. Then you can simply find it through the search function. The content you want to find, but remember to add your favorite channel to your favorites, hope it includes me. Finally, I want to say something sincere. No matter whether you are introverted or extroverted today, whether you are very E or very I, we are often the same when it comes to interpersonal relationships. Emphasizing quality over quantity means that having two or three friends who can even talk about hemorrhoids is better than 50 friends who only reply to limited posts but never meet in person. Friends who are in contact through social media are usually not very deep. In that case, my name is Vincent. See you next time. Goodbye.
