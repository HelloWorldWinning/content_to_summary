Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Core Idea:**
    *   天命 (Tianming/Destiny) is characterized by an unyielding drive to pursue a specific course of action, regardless of obstacles or personal cost.
    *   This drive transcends considerations of personal gain or outcome.
    *   The presence of calculation or questioning indicates the action is not aligned with one's Tianming.

2.  **Core Point:** Tianming is defined by the absence of calculation and the presence of an unwavering inner compulsion to act.

3.  **Fundamental Point:**  True destiny is about doing something because you must, not because of what you might get out of it.

4.  **Overarching Framework:** The content presents a framework for identifying one's Tianming, based on the presence or absence of self-interest and calculation.
