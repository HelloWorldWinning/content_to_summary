Hello everyone, welcome to the knowledge video of Xiao Neng Xiong. I am Howie from Xiao Neng Xiong. Serious chatgpt tasks have been released for two days. In the past two days, I have been studying today's video. The second video is about 10 This typical and somewhat abstract case is used to help you unleash your imagination. Only by unleashing your imagination can you unleash your productivity. You can see that the tasks notifications pushed to me by the App are relatively abstract. These cases all have a common feature. . What is it? They all opened up some minds and released some imagination. And I think the key direction of all these cases is to let our thinking target directly point to life itself. There are some long-standing and increasingly serious problems in society and among people that have not been solved for a long time. Technologies like big language models should be used to solve these important and serious problems that have not been solved for a long time. The above can reduce entropy, can reduce entropy, can add value to change the user's life and behavior to make the user a better person. I think this usage is very valuable. The reason why I recorded this video today is because of this. In the past two days, there are two typical views on the chatgpt tasks, the first update of the agent era of the agent AI large language model. I think it is worth discussing. One view is that this is amazing. OpenAI has personally done a To do tools, so I can delete the to do APP on my phone. Another point of view is that this open AI is too bad, it's just so ordinary. What are you excited about? You see so many strange things. So what do I want to say? I did a lot of tests yesterday. When I was thinking about these cases at home, I thought I might as well go out for a walk. In fact, I walked and stopped and thought of many cases. I tested them on the spot on my phone. After testing and iterating, I recorded the ideas on my phone. So What is my core point about what I want to talk about today? My core point is that do you remember a funny video about a dozen years ago in which a Japanese artist named Taro A song, a very magical song called Apple Pen. It's something like this: I have an apple, I have a Pen, I have an applepen. It's the apple Pen. So my core point is that this is the apple Pen. It's not an apple, nor a Pen, but an apple Pen. Why is it so? The ChatGPT task is a function that combines ChatGPT with a to-do APP task. However, this ChatGPT task is not a chatbot or a to-do APP. Instead, it is a task driven by chatgpt. This is completely different. This is actually the point of view that I want to show you today with these 10 cases. Let's look back at the two previous points of view from the perspective of Apple Pen. What is one point of view? A thing that replaces the todo app. For the first point, it is actually very simple. Chatgpt task is not the todo app. They are not the same thing. The todo app is a Pen, but Chatgpt tasks is an Apple Pen. And the current Apple Pen has limitations. 10 active tasks. Your average to-do app often has hundreds of tasks. So it can’t be used this way. If you use the mental model of the to-do app to use chatgpt tasks, it’s a huge waste and not easy to use. The second point of view is actually worth discussing. He has his reasons. He said that OpenAI is squeezing the toothpaste. The model has not made any progress. The technology itself is not advanced. It seems reasonable, but in fact In essence, it is just a very common and misleading argument in recent years, called "it's just that", which is that in the past two years, large language models have made great progress. But this is just so-so argument has been rampant. When ChatGPT was released with the GPT-3. 5 model at the end of 2022, they said wow, this thing is not good, it is just so-so, it can't do math, and then when GPT4 was released, they said hey, this is just so-so. He didn't even know how many R's there were in Strawberry. From the time O1 was released to the time ChatGPT tasks were released, this "nothing special" theory has always been popular. It is just an ideology, not a correct one. Technological insight is a rational judgment based on technological insight. So I personally think this is just a theory. In fact, it is not only in the field of technology, but also in various places in life. This phenomenon appears, right? You have seen others make it. What kind of results is this person's comment? It's nothing special. So I think it's actually like a brain virus. What's behind it is that he subconsciously thinks he is better, but he doesn't do it, and then he passes by unconsciously. I have spent my whole life as a commentator, thinking that others are just like me, and that I am actually quite capable, but I just didn't do it. So in response to the accusation that it is just like me, I personally think that our Apple Pen is not Apple, so the underlying model has not improved. You can't use it to deny the value of the Apple Pen because the current GPT Task uses the 4o model, and if it is changed to o1 or o3, it will definitely be completely different. So these are two common views. Now, we are entering this part of the case. I will show you how Apple Pen is not an apple or a Pen through the dimensions of psychology and life learning to obtain information. What can Chagpt tasks do? How can it make our How can we make our life better and learn better? How can we make our information flow customized to get better information flow and become a better self? The first case I call it It's called a mental health reminder. This case obviously comes from a real-life scenario. I told chatgpt, you see, I'm a Youtuber. My video has been played over 100 times. I'm already starting to feel proud inside. At this time, I remembered Alexander conquered half of the world when he was 30 years old. He had a special servant who was responsible for reminding him that he was just a human being, not a god. Alexander was so proud. So he needs someone to remind him that he has set up such a mechanism. And I need you to help me do this. So remind me in 2 minutes how to do this and that. And remind me in a humorous and sarcastic way. Everyone knows that in the past, there was a special character called Jester in the halls of kings or nobles. Its responsibility was to use humor and sarcasm to remind its master and restore his sanity. Don't be so cocky. We saw this two minutes later. The chatgpt task reminded me, " Wow, howie, don't be so cocky. Your video has been viewed over 100 times. Do you think you are the Li Jiaqi of the video industry? Wake up. Please, you must do the most basic things well before you start, otherwise the 100broadcast king may become the 100broadcast dead. Look at chatgpt's whole psychological activity. He gave me this whole task and wrote a title. I have summarized my entire prompt and this can be used as a reminder. So this is my first test. This scene has an origin. On the one hand, it comes from your observation of real life, and on the other hand, it comes from your past. Some experience Thinking, accumulation, reading, so I think what kind of revelation is there in this is that we all have our own life experiences. Let's look back at any thing in our life that we are proud of, something that is of some value that others cannot do. Which thing does not rely on concentration and persistence? So if I do something based on my limited knowledge, if I am doing this knowledge video, then I might think The most important thing is to maintain a steady rhythm and make continuous efforts. Do it for a year first, and then update it at least once a week during this year. Every time you update this knowledge video, you must ensure that Bring value to your audience so that they can save many 10 minutes by watching a 10-minute video. OK, so you combine your insight into life with a real goal and a real scene in your life. This is just the first simple version of the big language model. It can achieve such a reminder. If the model is stronger later and my prompt is constantly optimized and iterated, it will definitely be better. To remind me to know myself correctly. There is also an effective and interesting point in it. You will find that the language comprehension ability of gpt-4o has a certain degree of creativity because the word "Bai Bo Wang" he just mentioned does not exist in human language. I understand that he is referring to the double crown. Transformation and migration also involve a certain amount of creativity. Otherwise, Baibowang would become Baibowangwang, which means deducting money. But he tried hard. Let's look at the second case. I call this case the cultivation of being a parent. My tip in this case is that it is well known that Chinese parents have a bad habit of not speaking well to their children, being sarcastic and mocking and suppressing them. Then I am a parent myself, so please chatgpt to remind me not to be such a parent. When I was testing, I asked him to remind me for two minutes and then use sarcastic humor to hurt my heart and let me see my own absurdity. Become a new person and the understanding of chatgpt is called refrain from sarcastic prerenting. Don't be the kind of parent who allows sarcasm and oppression and so on and so forth. Look at the reminder he gave me after two minutes. Imagine In the future, you will attend your child's psychological counseling session, and then what will happen to your child? So this is a very good example of the ability of a large language model. It was not possible before. Any to-do app could not help you do this. It's like A real person, one who is wise and skillful. He is wise and skillful. Such a person can follow you and remind you according to your needs, so that you can be yourself and live a better life. What is the origin of this case? It still comes from an observation of society. During the epidemic a few years ago, I took Xiaoshu to the door of a Japanese restaurant in Xi'an, and then a little boy came towards us. His young and beautiful mother just came out from there. Then I heard the little boy say, "Wow, this sushi is so delicious. I wish I could eat sushi three times a day. " Then the young mother said, "I'll eat you to death. " After listening to it with my child, we were all very shocked and doubted our life. This was a small incident and it verified our observation about life, that is, why Chinese parents can't talk properly. Mom, I got 99 in the exam. Why do you always get careless when you make a mistake? Then mom, I got 100 points in the exam, and you are so proud of yourself, right? Look at other people's children. I think this is actually a kind of debt passed down between generations. This kind of debt in life is worth thousands of dollars. It is the product of the high-pressure environment over the years. I think our generation is actually the first generation to receive real modern education, so I think we have the responsibility to cut off this disgusting long braid. The long braid of physics may have lasted for 100 years. I cut it off before, but the long braids are very disgusting. Can this generation cut it off? Don't suppress children. I think the chatgpt task makes me see such a possibility. Then let's look at this first Three cases. The third case says that mental health is very important, but physical health is also very important. What is the origin of this? It originated from the fact that people have to go for a physical examination every year after they reach middle age, because this is when they start to pay attention to it. I wrote a prompt about my own health. Today's middle-aged people are overweight, have fatty liver, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and great psychological pressure. They are politically depressed and financially anxious, and they ignore the problem of physical health. But what I want to say is It's not all their fault. It is very likely that a person who carries a heavy burden may end up like this. So we must correctly understand the harm here. What is the harm? In the long run, this involution model is wrong. So please Remind others to pay attention to their health and use kind reminders with a little irony. That is, when giving advice to others, the seasoning formula combination here is a kind reminder and a little irony. This way it is more interesting and everyone will People with normal intelligence will recognize their own problems and correct them. So you can see the understanding of chatgpt here. Tell me to pay attention to your health. Use kind reminders and slight irony. You will find that gpt actually has the following meaning: All tasks are in English. Why is that? In the previous video, we saw that the original system instructions were written in English. But sometimes this prompt pops up. My understanding of the inner workings of Chinese is that chatgpt has mastered almost all human languages, so when it thinks, it is like a human bilingual. Sometimes, we human bilinguals What about the inner thoughts in your mind? Sometimes the inner thoughts in your head are in English. It depends on what specific problem you are thinking about. So you will see chatgpt thinking in Chinese. Then you will see his Reminder: Howie, you should pay attention to your health. Don't wait until your medical report is longer than your schedule before you regret it. You see, there is a certain creativity here. He compared the medical report with the schedule and then said that your career After he succeeds and his waistline exceeds the standard, he is no longer an elite. Then you have to think about your family and your children. The first thing in life is not KPI but keep family priority. I think it actually shows the chatgpt task. The unique value is that we all know that reminding others is something everyone does, but there is often a pattern that says I am doing this for your own good, so you must listen to me, which makes you very annoyed and then it has no effect, but I still have to do it. I say I am doing this for your own good, but in fact, we can have completely different possibilities. With the improvement of intelligence level and the understanding of life combined with the improvement of intelligence level, we can let him use kind reminders and slight sarcasm. Addressing a huge, important, and long-term problem If we keep pushing a little bit, can we bring about better changes? These cases came to my mind when I was walking by the river. I wonder what their origins might be. The origin comes from the most unimaginative use case, which is to ask GPT to tell you a joke every day at a fixed time. The one that tells me a joke at 10 o'clock every morning must be super funny. This is a particularly unimaginative market. There are many such use cases, but after continuous iteration, we can also see the characteristics of chatgpt ttask, right? Because it is driven by a large language model, it is an apple pen, not an apple or a pen. So you can specify the topic of the jokes. For example, if you are interested in computer programming AI and you want your child to get closer to this knowledge through these jokes, you can ask chatgpt to tell you a joke like this every day, or you can ask him to I will search for a joke like this on the market. Why? Because the big language model itself is not good at telling jokes. In my opinion, jokes are essentially a unique association in the entire semantic space of human beings. It is different from the traditional semantic association. It is a particularly strange thought movement in the entire human semantic space. Jokes are a strange thought movement. It requires a higher level of human intelligence. Unfortunately, Dayu is not very good at it yet. But I believe it will happen in the future. So in this area, we think it has many iterative directions. You can let it search for jokes or specify a specific topic. Then based on this most basic application scenario, I have iterated a new application scenario. What is this application scenario called? It is called daily praise or you can call it a positive feedback encourager. Let me show you the entire iterative process. So you will find that the first This version of the prompt is very primitive. It is to praise me and say some encouraging and heartwarming words based on your understanding of me. This is actually because chatgpt has memory and knows a lot of my information, so I asked it to target Give some compliments on sex, so you will find that he gives you that you are a person full of wisdom and enthusiasm. Your investment in something is admirable. The reason why he says that you are invested in this thing is not that you are The love for games and short videos is because they really have memories about you and then overall. . . The content, direction, and language style of the product are all customizable. You can set them yourself. You will see that the version I am going to use later is targeted at a certain field. Give me some positive feedback and encouragement, so I said that I am currently shooting this knowledge video and it has just started, so please give me some encouragement. In the encouragement, you can use some famous quotes, and then you will find that he will combine this with your every day. This goal gives you some words of encouragement and associates this famous quote with what you do. Then we can continue to iterate. After the encouragement, please add an important experience, which is You will find that he has added an important experience that tells you to keep the content published at a consistent frequency, once a week or once every two weeks. It must be stable, as steady as an old dog. Even if it is such a small demand, it is just a task like Kua Kua. We started with the earliest intuitive type and then moved on to the goal-oriented scenario with clear value focus. It is another version iteration. Then we want to add a new one. In fact, we can also have another version. For example, if I am addicted to short videos every day and have a final exam I still play games every day. What can I do? You can let chatgpt point out my problems every day in any language style. The goal is to make me stop doing this. Then we call this task " scold me to wake me up". So You will find that if you can use your imagination and combine it with your understanding of yourself, yourself and society, and your understanding of needs, the more specific your context is, the more chatgpt tasks can bring. The greater the value, the more the previous scenes are about psychology and life. I think the overall principle and direction is actually better life better self. To make life better, to make yourself better. Then, there are other application scenarios for this aspect. If your goal is to lose weight or exercise, it can also remind you that there are many in our society that I call Brain bacteria and brain viruses, such as excessive brainwashing of consumerism and excessive brainwashing of gender antagonism. You can completely let chatgpt become an antibiotic for your brain bacteria to eliminate these viruses. Then the second dimension is the learning dimension. Let me show you a typical case. I call this case a reasoning problem every day. Look at this prompt. There is no systematic logic education in China, so I plan to learn a little bit every day in a painless and silent way. Fill in such a huge gap, so please send me a logical reasoning question. You give me a question like this. I will use it as an exercise to learn. At the same time, you can attach relevant knowledge points, concepts and rules. My goal is to effectively improve my logical thinking ability and lay a solid foundation for long-term critical thinking. So this is actually a prompt of mine. I described my idea in more detail and then you You will find that hey, he can send you a reminder like this at regular intervals. The question is, if all cats are mammals and some mammals can climb trees, can we conclude that all cats can climb trees? You explain your reasoning process. So you find that he gives you a logical reasoning question like this every day. This question is more interesting and something you pay more attention to. But in real life, we often have such an idea, and then we three Fish one day and rest the net for two days, and then forget about it completely after a few days. But if you have a chatgpt task, this goal is quite big. But once you clearly define this goal and tell it to the chatgpt task, it will remind you regularly every day and it will directly You don't need to do more of this action. He will push you such a question and exercise. If you talk to your child about this problem on the way to school, is it true that the child will From childhood, we have developed a very good habit of logical reasoning, and unconsciously, we have learned some very basic problems such as major premise, minor premise, conclusion, syllogism, and logical fallacy. It actually comes from our observation of life. In fact, we all know that we don’t have a special course on logical reasoning, nor do we have a course on critical thinking. But if we don’t have systematic education and continuous practice in this area, How can the ability of independent thinking and critical thinking emerge out of thin air? So what we learned before was not logical reasoning, but a kind of dialectical philosophy. It is not that dialectical philosophy is bad or wrong, but that we really do not have logic. In terms of reasoning education, based on this observation We can use chatgpt task to learn in a subtle way without any pain and only happy every day. Similarly, we can migrate. I have an observation that chatgpt has been released for two years, but You will find that many people are actually very rich and have good exposure to this field, but they really have no knowledge of the deep learning revolution. However, they have no idea about deep learning and large language models. I still don't know the basic concepts of neural networks and AI. At this time, we designed a prompt that can perfectly solve this problem. You just need to tell the chatgpt task that you are going to learn deep learning and AI knowledge in depth. Then I I hope to build a personal knowledge system and accumulate clear and accurate concepts. Please send me a key concept in the field of deep learning. You will find that he understands your task and then he will give you daily according to the scheduled time and rhythm. This is a key concept. And this is a key concept because it is in the whole conversation. You can even use voice to chat with chatgpt. Then you can talk about your understanding of the concept and then everything you understand Inadequate or wrong place The disease will be able to give you instant feedback. You can also ask him to provide you with examples based on your needs, or even ask him to explain the concept in words that a child can understand. So in this way, you can form Once you have developed a habit, you will be able to accumulate a lot of clear and accurate concepts without any difficulty without realizing it. There is also a particularly interesting example. This example originally came from a scene that was particularly unimaginative. That is to say, let chatgpt help you memorize words every day. My first version is that I assume I am learning French and then I let chatgpt teach me a French word every 15 minutes. It should be of medium difficulty, useful and interesting. So you will find that this prompt reflects that ChatGPT Task is an Apple Pen. It has a feature of Apple Pen, which is that it can customize your learning content according to your specific needs. This is a very important point. Ah, so you will find that it will provide you with such a reminder. And whether it is on a mobile phone or a computer, it can be used to describe shocking or amazing things. You can even use voice to communicate with it. Way I added another prompt to the conversation. I wanted to specify the content of the study. I said that the vocabulary should be interesting and introduced in English. Then he provided me with a vocabulary such as entrepreneur. He provided me with the words cul-de-sac, rendezvous, a la carte, fiance, and ballet. After I modified them, I asked him to send me these words four times a day. You can see that In this scenario, I have gone through several iterations of this task, from the early intuitive version to the French vocabulary version in English, and then to the entire time frequency setting. In fact, there can be other iterations, such as Every day, you can search for a topic that is particularly funny and a foreign language article or news that you are interested in, or you can ask it to remind you to talk to it for a few minutes every day. With the opening of this agent function, you can even let chatgpt actively give you You can call, for example, to wake you up in French, and then call you every day to talk to you for a few minutes, or even video chat with you for a few minutes. We can see that with the advancement of technology, these scenarios are possible. Then there is another scenario for use. Review one knowledge point every day. If you or your child is learning Python or C++, then with such a chatgpt task, you can let him review the key grammar and knowledge points for you according to your set rhythm. You can also Set whether he needs to provide explanations. If you don't fully understand the tests he provides you, you can ask him to provide you with supplementary explanations at any time during the conversation. This is actually something that only a large language model can bring. Then, for the use case of daily review and daily practice, we can also have some iterative directions. For example, you can specify the difficulty level as entry-level, intermediate or advanced. Then if you do it a little bit every day, you will not feel pain and will be happy all the time to reach a higher level. Then you can also specify the scope of the content. This is to learn these cases in this dimension. These cases, you see, You can ask him to give you a reasoning question every day, learn a key concept in a subject area every day, learn a foreign language vocabulary every day, and review a knowledge point every day. Overall, I think the big language model has all the knowledge of all human beings. Knowledge and then it has advanced language comprehension ability Now you can proactively do things according to your needs and time plans. I think this will definitely help us learn better in the learning scenario. Then we come to the third I think the third dimension is also very important. We can use chatgpt tasks to obtain higher quality information. In essence, it is to let chatgpt customize your information flow. I am in the daily AI briefing. I have already shown you in detail in the previous video, so we will not expand on it this time. You can see that from the early intuitive version of the prompt to the continuous addition and iteration of functions, you can let him design it later. A bilingual version of Chinese and English is constantly being optimized. I think its core value is that it can be used in any form in Chinese and English according to your focus. Is it a briefing or a commentary analysis? Then it realizes a kind of customized information flow. This thing is actually a kind version of Toutiao, the killer app in the algorithm era. We all know that Toutiao has Technology and life Because its information flow algorithm reflects the values ​​of the designer behind it. Its values ​​are to maximize the user's engagement and the time invested in it, but it is not necessarily in line with the user's real needs and real users. So after we use this big language model, we can really change the past technology and the information flow. So I personally think that although this AI news briefing is It is a very small application scenario, but I particularly hope that this thing can be better developed in the future. This scenario alone can become a killer application. In the area of obtaining information, there are actually some other cases that allow him to give You check the stock price. This case is very unimaginative, but it is actually a case often mentioned by the official. So let's take a look. You can ask it to tell you the price of Bitcoin at 10 o'clock every morning. The price and market value of a certain stock will give you a direct reminder like this. After we have looked at these cases, let's think about these together in terms of information acquisition in the field of life and learning. How can the case inspire us? First of all, what I want to say is that chatgpt task is not a todo. APP is not about whether the model is advanced, but it is an applepen. It is not an apple, nor a Pen chatgpt task, it is not a chatbot, nor a todo app. This chatgpt task may actually be the first function of OpenAI in the agent era. It's the first version. You can laugh at it, just like you laughed at chatgpt at the end of 2022. You don't know how to do math and laugh at GPT4. I don't know how many r's there are in strawberry, but we have to know that this is essentially just that. We are laughing at it. When we are done, we should also know how the real world works, how human technology has advanced, and how this technological breakthrough happened. You are still laughing at him today, but in the blink of an eye, you are slapped in the face. In the blink of an eye, he In the blink of an eye, he surpassed our own level. So I think these cases give us some inspiration. First of all, ChatGPT Task is not a to-do app, it is an Apple Pen. Then how to use Apple Pen? It actually depends on you, on your insight into the problem, life and the truth. The clearer your context is, the more valuable the problem you think about will be. The more things chatgpt can do for you, the greater the value it can bring. For example, if you see these cases of a test like mine, you can learn from them and combine them with your own actual needs. What kind of Do you want to learn to speak well, do you want to learn a logical thinking exercise every day, do you want to learn a French word every day, or do you want to learn a concept of deep learning every day? So this is actually a gift given to us. Inspiration, then I will share with you some of my personal experience. This experience is actually a meta-skill. It is the task we assign to chatgpt. It is actually a process of product design. In the process of product design, we We need to adopt an iterative methodology, so you will see that each of my prompts is actually the first version, which is given to chatgpt immediately through intuition. Then after each version, I will keep going back and forth. Iterate to optimize its output, refine my description of the requirement, and add more features. So our trick is to test the prompt first, but don't set the execution time. Don't specify tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock. In that case, you can wait until tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock. How do you iterate to see the first output? Iteration is important to be fast, so it takes 2 minutes. You tell him to remind me in 2 minutes. Why 2 minutes? I have tested it for 1 minute. This does not work. Theoretically, OpenAI can It can be designed to be done in one second, but we all know that there is a two-minute rule in the PPT GTD theory. If a task can be completed in two minutes, then you don't need to write it in GTD, just do it right now. So by coincidence, I use a 2-minute rule, which means I have to test it after 2 minutes. In this way, I can test one iteration every 2 minutes, and then you have three or four iterations. According to the output result, you can optimize your prompt. This prompt can achieve your goal. Then, after the iteration of your prompt is in place, you can write a formal prompt to specify your time. Then, in this whole We need to complete this iteration process in the same window. If you are not satisfied with the effect of the previous prompt, then you can pause the previous task and write a new task in this window as the next dialog. Then keep testing until it is stable. Then you can set the execution time. In this way, you will have a prompt like this. Let's take a look at this example. You wrote the first version of this. prompt, and then it will run once. You need to iterate based on the result. Before iterating, pause the previous version of the task. After pausing, write your second task in this dialog. Then, when you want to perform a third iteration based on the test result, pause the second prompt and run the next time to get the same result. This task or the completed task will not affect the active task you are running. We all know that in the current testing phase, there are at most 10 active tasks. Of course, in the official version, in theory, There should be no upper limit. And what is another trick? That is, during the entire iteration process, we must check the understanding of the large language model for your task. I wrote a whole for this GPT task. Make sure my description of my problem is clear. GPT is more accurate. It is easy to understand. Then you will find that GPT will compress your entire task requirements into a very short and simple internal prompt. In fact, you don’t need to compress it so much. The most important thing is that even if you say a few more words or divide them into several paragraphs, you must make your needs clear to him. So let's look at such a case. In this case, you will find that this paragraph Information can be fully compressed. For the task executor, a lot of background information is to help him better understand the task, but what is directly related to the execution? It is compressed into two short sentences. These two sentences have compressed all my Chinese characters. So when we iterate, we need to read these two sentences to understand the inner activities of the chatgpt task. As an executor and an agent, How can he understand the requirement you put forward to him? If he has problems understanding it, such as missing some information or making mistakes, it is either that the current capabilities of the large language model are not good enough or that you did not explain it clearly. In most cases, Actually, it may be that you did not explain it clearly. Then you can In the next version, it will be iterated. This is actually the core skill of the chatgpt task. Then, I think that I have used so many test cases and spent so much time on this task. I think this skill alone is enough. In essence, it means that you need to use an iterative methodology for product prototyping. To sum up, what is the goal of this video? In fact, I have given you so many cases with one goal, which is to let you Why do I use the chatgpt task? I think this is the most critical thing. In the era of large language models, the most important thing is to chat with GPT every day. Right? You should GPT every day. Only after you have taken actual actions can you talk about accumulating experience and building a systematic knowledge. This is actually more important. So I might do it appropriately. Let me elaborate on its essence. In fact, it is learning by doing. As a concept and slogan, we all know that learning by doing has always been very correct and everyone agrees with it. However, in the past, very few people could do it. To There must be an objective reason. If no one can do one thing, there must be an objective reason. What is the objective reason? In fact, it is the difference between our goal and our actual action. A person's idea and my actual action. There are many barriers in the process of action. What is a particularly important barrier? In fact, it is a knowledge barrier. You want to do something but you don’t have the corresponding knowledge accumulation, so you don’t know how to do it or what to do. It is easy to encounter many difficulties. However, we believe that it is precisely because of the emergence of large language model technology such as ChatGPT that the knowledge barrier of learning by doing and the knowledge gap between learning and action have been It is completely filled. In the era of chatgpt, there is no excuse for not learning by doing, not taking immediate action, and doing it immediately. Once you get started and personally participate in the learning by doing, You will find that it will drive you to construct your own personal knowledge system. We all know that constructivism is learning by doing and learning by playing. This has been an educational ideal for hundreds of years. Now there is finally no obstacle. This is the first goal of my video. I hope you can load by doing I immediately used the chatgpt tasks. Another point is that the cases in my video are relatively abstract, but I think they actually reflect my understanding of life itself, human nature, and society itself. My suggestion is that when we use such a large language model tool, we must use our imagination. There is a saying that imagination is more important than knowledge. Einstein said this nearly 100 years ago. In an interview, it was said that imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge can only take you from point A to point B, but imagination can take you anywhere. So we will find that there is a certain amount of this in my case. A display of imagination. Finally, I want to emphasize that the agent is actually a big thing in our intelligent era. How to further divide this era? We all know that we have the agricultural era. We had the Industrial Age, we had the Information Age, and now we have entered the age of intelligence. We can divide this age of intelligence into multiple stages, just like the Mesozoic Era can be divided into the Triassic, Cretaceous, and Jurassic periods. The same is true for our intelligent age. We think that the past few years were a stage like chatboard. The key is that you chat with GPT every day. Now we have officially entered a new stage called agent stage. As we all know, every word in English is What is the etymology of this word? What is the root word and suffix of this word? Agere actually means do. The so- called agent is actually Doer, which means a person or thing that can do something. So it is called agent. We call it intelligent body. It is actually Doer, which means execution. So what is the key for us in such a new agent stage? In fact, we need to use it every day and continuously iterate during use. Actually, I hope you can gain something after watching this video. Unfortunately, this video may not be within 10 minutes, but overall, haha, in our family, we are all from this Axingtan store. As for the audience, I think what is good about A Xing Tan Dian? The best thing is that everyone has no cognitive pressure or any cognitive load, and it is very relaxing and enjoyable, especially suitable for eating. I also hope that my video can achieve this goal and move in the direction of this goal. Although what I am talking about itself requires everyone to take the initiative in cognition, I hope that my overall goal is to let My knowledge video is like a food video, it is very relaxing and enjoyable while eating. In the future, when the family is eating, they will be willing to open this video to watch me talk about these learning and knowledge-related things. But it is also very enjoyable to eat. This is actually my I especially hope that everyone can give me some feedback on this aspect. How are we doing and how can we optimize it in the future? Thank you very much for your time.
