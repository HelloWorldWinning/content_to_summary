 Hi everyone, my name is Terry and I wanted to answer a question that I saw in the comment section. The person asked, is campus bullying so serious in your area? My answer is yes, it is very serious. My best friend committed suicide because the bullying was so bad. Me and him got called the worst names you could ever think of. And it wasn't just students who were bullying us, it was also the teachers, the staff members who were supposed to protect us and be kind to us. My friend went to the counselor to say how bad the bullying was, only for her to say, oh is this just an excuse for you to go home? Here's a picture with me and my best friend together. Then here's the last text message I got before he shot himself. Going back to school after he committed suicide was the worst experience of my life. Because I asked the principal, the principal of the school, was he going to do anything to the bullies who bullied my friend to death? His response was, it doesn't matter anymore since he's dead. I started when I was 80, yeah, 60-60s. When you were 80? I'm 80-60s. Oh my gosh. Do you enjoy working here? Yeah, I really do. That's the only reason I'm here to tell you the truth. It is currently 5.39 a.m. here in Los Angeles, California. And I can't sleep. And I have been scrolling through red note and I am surprised to find out that you guys had no idea that we sell. Optionally, our blood and plasma in exchange for money to pay our bills. What the fuck?
