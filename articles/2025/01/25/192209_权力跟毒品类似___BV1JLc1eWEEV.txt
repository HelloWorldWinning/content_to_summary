Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Power as Addiction:**
    *   The text compares power to an addictive drug, suggesting that once someone possesses it, they become reluctant to relinquish it.
2.  **Autocratic Systems and Power Retention:**
    *   In autocratic regimes, rulers rarely voluntarily give up power.
    *   Instead, there are many examples of leaders clinging to power, even when facing dire consequences.
3.  **The Guangxu Emperor's Predicament:**
    *   The Guangxu Emperor is depicted as trapped in a situation where he cannot obtain real power due to the entrenched power of Cixi.
    *   Cixi’s firm grip on power makes Guangxu's role akin to a puppet, similar to how Emperor Jiaqing had to wait for his predecessor's death before fully assuming control.
4. **Historical Parallels**
     *   Emperor Jiaqing's experience of waiting for his father’s death to have power is used as an example
     *    However, Guangxu’s situation is deemed more difficult due to Cixi’s younger age and stronger grip on power.
5.  **Guangxu's Limited Options:**
    *   Guangxu's tragedy stems from his attempt to challenge this destiny, even though there may have been less confrontational strategies
    *   He could have adopted a more patient or indirect approach to power.
6. **Alternative strategies**
    *  Let Cixi manage the country, even if it's in bad condition,
    *  After Cixi's retirement, take the power back when Guangxu is 38, his prime.

**Core Point:** The core issue is that the Guangxu Emperor was destined to be a figurehead due to the unyielding power of Cixi, who, like a drug addict, would not relinquish control.

**Fundamental Point:**  Power, especially in autocratic systems, can become an addictive force that leaders rarely willingly give up, trapping those below them in a struggle for control.

**Overarching Framework:** The overarching framework is a historical analysis of power dynamics in an autocratic system, drawing parallels between emperors to highlight the challenges of obtaining and wielding true authority.

我感觉权力跟毒品类似碰不得否则就可能上眼一旦拥有了权力恐怕中身都离不开在专制体制之下基本没有统治者自动放权的县力相反大祸林头硬死都不交权的例子比一比结实从这个意义上说只要辞起火一天他就不会把权力交给光徐也就是说光徐皇帝注定了充当辞起回了你的命运在这一点上光徐的太爷爷家庆皇帝已经做出了榜样了当年家庆登基的时候前龙太上皇嘴上说交权但实际上课权不放家庆皇帝密来顺受熬到四年后太上皇少中正秦才藏了名副七十的一国之局其苦动可想而去当然若要光徐帝效仿家庆帝未免有点难为的因为家庆登基的时候前龙太上皇已经85岁了还能活几天装说那也有个叛徒吗而在光徐结婚新增的1889年辞起才55岁甚至故很适应了受中正秦的那一天摇摇无期在活20年30年也不是没有可登装几年孙都不难装几十年说的那就不容易了谁干系一直被人抄中然而藏库的事实是即使辞起活到100岁光徐也必须心甘情愿做一个归雷他一生的悲剧的根源就在于他要抗择这一命运今天看来光徐要权办法也有很多不能直接达到目的还有语曦曲折的办法不能强硬还有温和退让的办法退一步说只要辞起高兴光徐不防套光养会任其大宣独党当时的中国就那么个烂他辞起愿意管让他管呗他管不动了他玩够了自然就是光徐的为其实辞起手中正醒的时候光徐在38岁作为一个大国的元首正是体力经历智慧成熟的壮点你大可不必仅于多权应该学学潜服吗
