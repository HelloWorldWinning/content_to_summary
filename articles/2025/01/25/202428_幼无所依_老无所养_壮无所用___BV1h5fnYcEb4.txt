**总结:**

1.  **核心观点:**  校园欺凌问题非常严重，甚至导致了悲剧性的自杀事件，且学校未能对此进行有效处理。
2.  **根本观点:** 校园欺凌不仅来自学生，也来自教职员工，这种忽视和漠视加剧了受害者的痛苦，揭示了系统性问题。
3.  **总体框架:**  这是一个关于校园欺凌及其后果的个人叙述，揭露了学校系统未能保护学生，并对受害者造成的伤害，同时揭示了美国社会中存在的令人震惊的为生存出售血液和血浆的现象。

 Hi everyone, my name is Terry and I wanted to answer a question that I saw in the comment section. The person asked, is campus bullying so serious in your area? My answer is yes, it is very serious. My best friend committed suicide because the bullying was so bad. Me and him got called the worst names you could ever think of. And it wasn't just students who were bullying us, it was also the teachers, the staff members who were supposed to protect us and be kind to us. My friend went to the counselor to say how bad the bullying was, only for her to say, oh is this just an excuse for you to go home? Here's a picture with me and my best friend together. Then here's the last text message I got before he shot himself. Going back to school after he committed suicide was the worst experience of my life. Because I asked the principal, the principal of the school, was he going to do anything to the bullies who bullied my friend to death? His response was, it doesn't matter anymore since he's dead. I started when I was 80, yeah, 60-60s. When you were 80? I'm 80-60s. Oh my gosh. Do you enjoy working here? Yeah, I really do. That's the only reason I'm here to tell you the truth. It is currently 5.39 a.m. here in Los Angeles, California. And I can't sleep. And I have been scrolling through red note and I am surprised to find out that you guys had no idea that we sell. Optionally, our blood and plasma in exchange for money to pay our bills. What the fuck?
