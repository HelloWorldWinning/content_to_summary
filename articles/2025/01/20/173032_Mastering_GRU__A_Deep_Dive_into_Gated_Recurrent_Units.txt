Description:
**Simplified Chinese|简体中文**

**1. 核心要点:** GRU（门控循环单元）通过使用更新门和重置门来解决传统循环神经网络（RNN）的梯度消失问题，从而更有效地处理序列数据。

**2. 基本要点:** GRU的核心在于其更新门和重置门机制，允许网络学习保留长期信息并删除不相关的信息，从而克服了传统RNN的限制。

**3. 总体框架:**  该内容围绕GRU架构展开，主要讨论了GRU如何通过更新门和重置门来处理序列数据，并比较了其与传统RNN和LSTM的优缺点。

**4. 概念图:**

foreign [Music] unit offered a streamlined version of the long short-term memory cell that often achieves comparable performance but with the advantage of being faster to compute Gru aims to solve the vanishing gradient problem which comes with a standard recurrent neural network to solve the vanishing gradient problem of a standard RNN Gru uses so-called update gate and reset gate basically these are two vectors which decide what information should be passed to the output the special thing about them is that they can be trained to keep information from long ago without washing it through time or remove information which is irrelevant to the prediction the update gate helps the model to determine how much of the past information needs to be passed along to the Future that is really powerful because the model can decide to copy all the information from the past and eliminate the risk of Vanishing gradient problem the input to the update gate is the hidden layer at the previous time step and the current input both have their weights associated with them which are learned during the training process finally results are added together and a sigma activation function is applied to squash the result between 0 and 1. a reset gate identifies the unnecessary information and decides what information to be laid off from the gru Network simply put it decides what information to delete at the specific timestamp the input to the reset gate is the hidden layer at the previous time step and the current input both have their weights associated with them which are learned during the training process finally results are added together and a sigmoid activation function is applied to squash the result between 0 and 1. it is important to note that the weights associated with the hidden layer at the previous time step and the current input are different for both gates the values for these weights are learned during the training process calculating the output by using these two gates we use these two gates to calculate the final output of Gru a new memory location is created that stores the information from the past using the reset gate we multiply the current input by its weight and hidden layer at the previous with weight we then calculate the atom mark Prada the element-wise product between the output of the reset gate we then take the sum and apply the tan activation function as the last step the network needs to calculate Vector which holds information for the current unit and passes it down to the network in order to do that the update gate is needed it determines what to collect from the current memory content and what from the previous steps that is done as follows first apply element wise multiplication to the update gate and previous hidden layer second apply element wise multiplication to One update gate and current memory function third sum the results from Step 1 and 2. in summary reset Gates help capture short-term dependencies and sequences update Gates help capture long-term dependencies and sequences Gru uses less memory and is faster than lstm however lstm is more accurate when using data sets with longer sequences also Gru's address the vanishing gradient problem from which vanilla recurrent neural networks suffer foreign [Music]
