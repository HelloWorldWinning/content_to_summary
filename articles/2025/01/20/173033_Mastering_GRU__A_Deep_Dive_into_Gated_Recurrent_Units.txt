Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Introduction to GRU**
    *   GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) is a simplified version of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) cells.
    *   It often achieves comparable performance to LSTM but computes faster.
    *   GRU aims to solve the vanishing gradient problem of standard RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks).

**II. Core Components of GRU: Gates**
    *   **Update Gate:**
        *   Determines how much past information should be passed to the future.
        *   Helps the model retain long-term dependencies and avoid the vanishing gradient problem.
        *   Calculates a value between 0 and 1 using inputs from the previous hidden layer and current input, both having learnable weights, and applying a sigmoid activation.
    *   **Reset Gate:**
        *   Identifies and decides what information to discard at a specific timestamp.
        *   Calculates a value between 0 and 1 using inputs from the previous hidden layer and current input, both having learnable weights, and applying a sigmoid activation.
        *   Weights are different from those of the update gate.

**III. GRU Output Calculation**
    *   **New Memory Creation:**
        *   Calculated using the reset gate, current input (with weights), and previous hidden layer (with weights).
        *   The result of the reset gate's element-wise product and calculation of the new memory is applied to a tan activation function.
    *   **Current Output Calculation:**
        *   Uses the update gate to determine how much of the current memory and previous hidden state to combine.
        *   This is done by multiplying the update gate with previous hidden layer, and (1 - update gate) with new memory output.
        *   Results are then summed to produce the final output.

**IV. Functional Summary of Gates**
    *   **Reset Gate:** Focuses on capturing short-term dependencies.
    *   **Update Gate:** Focuses on capturing long-term dependencies.

**V. Comparison with LSTM**
    *   GRU uses less memory and is faster than LSTM.
    *   LSTM is more accurate when using longer sequences.

**Core Point:** GRU utilizes update and reset gates to selectively retain and discard information over time, effectively addressing the vanishing gradient problem and capturing both short and long-term dependencies in sequential data.

**Fundamental Point:** GRUs streamline the mechanics of recurrent neural networks, providing a computationally efficient alternative to LSTMs, albeit with potential trade-offs in accuracy for very long sequences.

**Overarching Framework:**  The GRU operates within the context of recurrent neural networks, using gated mechanisms to modulate information flow, thereby enhancing its capability to process sequential data by selectively remembering past information and avoiding vanishing gradients.

foreign [Music] unit offered a streamlined version of the long short-term memory cell that often achieves comparable performance but with the advantage of being faster to compute Gru aims to solve the vanishing gradient problem which comes with a standard recurrent neural network to solve the vanishing gradient problem of a standard RNN Gru uses so-called update gate and reset gate basically these are two vectors which decide what information should be passed to the output the special thing about them is that they can be trained to keep information from long ago without washing it through time or remove information which is irrelevant to the prediction the update gate helps the model to determine how much of the past information needs to be passed along to the Future that is really powerful because the model can decide to copy all the information from the past and eliminate the risk of Vanishing gradient problem the input to the update gate is the hidden layer at the previous time step and the current input both have their weights associated with them which are learned during the training process finally results are added together and a sigma activation function is applied to squash the result between 0 and 1. a reset gate identifies the unnecessary information and decides what information to be laid off from the gru Network simply put it decides what information to delete at the specific timestamp the input to the reset gate is the hidden layer at the previous time step and the current input both have their weights associated with them which are learned during the training process finally results are added together and a sigmoid activation function is applied to squash the result between 0 and 1. it is important to note that the weights associated with the hidden layer at the previous time step and the current input are different for both gates the values for these weights are learned during the training process calculating the output by using these two gates we use these two gates to calculate the final output of Gru a new memory location is created that stores the information from the past using the reset gate we multiply the current input by its weight and hidden layer at the previous with weight we then calculate the atom mark Prada the element-wise product between the output of the reset gate we then take the sum and apply the tan activation function as the last step the network needs to calculate Vector which holds information for the current unit and passes it down to the network in order to do that the update gate is needed it determines what to collect from the current memory content and what from the previous steps that is done as follows first apply element wise multiplication to the update gate and previous hidden layer second apply element wise multiplication to One update gate and current memory function third sum the results from Step 1 and 2. in summary reset Gates help capture short-term dependencies and sequences update Gates help capture long-term dependencies and sequences Gru uses less memory and is faster than lstm however lstm is more accurate when using data sets with longer sequences also Gru's address the vanishing gradient problem from which vanilla recurrent neural networks suffer foreign [Music]
