Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Error Type:** The error is a `TypeError`.
2.  **Specific Error:** The specific `TypeError` message is "object str can't be used in 'await' expression".
3.  **Cause:**  The error indicates that a string object (text) was mistakenly used where an `awaitable` object (like a coroutine or a Future) was expected. This typically happens when attempting to `await` something that is not asynchronous (not a coroutine or a future).

**Core Point:** The error arises because the program incorrectly tried to `await` a plain string, which is not a valid operation for asynchronous programming.

**Fundamental Point:** The code has a type mismatch in an asynchronous context where `await` was used incorrectly on a non-awaitable object, leading to `TypeError`.

**Overarching Framework:** Asynchronous programming error handling. Specifically, the incorrect usage of `await`.
