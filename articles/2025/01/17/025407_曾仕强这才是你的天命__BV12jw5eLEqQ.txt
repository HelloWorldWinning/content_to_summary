Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Core Ideas:**

*   **天命 (Tiānmìng - Mandate of Heaven/Destiny):** A driving force that compels you to act regardless of external factors.
*   **Unwavering Commitment:**  Acting out of inherent necessity, even if it involves great personal sacrifice.
*   **Beyond Practical Considerations:**  Pursuing the action is paramount, transcending questions of cost or outcome.
*   **Absence of Calculation:** True destiny is not weighed by considerations of profit or loss.
*   **Presence of Calculation:**  If you are still considering practical implications, that action is not aligned with your destiny.

**II. Conclusions:**

*   **Core Point:** Tianming is an irresistible internal drive that compels action irrespective of external consequences.
*   **Fundamental Point:**  The presence or absence of calculation (regarding cost/outcome) is the defining factor differentiating an action aligned with your Tianming from one that is not.

**III. Overarching Framework:**

The content presents a binary framework: actions are either aligned with one's destiny (Tianming) or not. The alignment is determined by the presence of a compulsive drive and the absence of calculations regarding gain or loss.
