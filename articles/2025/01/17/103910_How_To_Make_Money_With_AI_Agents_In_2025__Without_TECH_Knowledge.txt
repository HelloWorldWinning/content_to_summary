if you think AI agents are just for Tech experts then you could not be more wrong don't get left behind the AI Gold Rush is here but everyone's looking in the wrong direction in the next few minutes I'm going to reveal why AI agents are the real money printers of 20125 we're going to go through many different ways you can actually find trending AI agents and how do you actually make money from this booming industry this is another video where you're probably going to want to take notes I know I would because a lot of this stuff in the last few months was completely new to me and I'm trying my best to keep up with the pace of development cuz it's so rapid right now this is a beginner friendly video we're going to right to the beginning and just talk about AI agents exactly what the hell they even are and why this is a big deal right now let's have a look first at 2024 what are the trends we've seen like meme coins on Google Trends here you can search for it yourself and you'll see that the trend has obvious Peaks and troughs but it's always uptrending even now the interest is way higher than the Peaks we saw back in March or or even uh June with mean coins but we saw a very important Peak on November around November 20th and that's when a lot of the old school mem coins the older ones cat and dogcoin stuff like that they all kind of pull back fine but why is this important well the trend is still up very much with meme coins but have a look when you search for AI agents this is crazy like that chart tells you everything you need to know people keep saying like um AI agents have had their hype what are you talking about like the hype's only getting going now like this is lifechanging um uh technology completely lifechanging let me show you exactly why this is my horrible picture of a brain and a body the brains when it comes to AI those are the llms for example chat GPT for example clae deep seek all of these ones that you more than likely have played with already chpt is something where you can ask the AI a question any normal question you'd usually do on Google search in the past and it will give you a very very good answer way better than what Google was doing before it can even give you medical advice or find things for you or research things for you very useful that's the brain now what's an AI agent it combines the brain with a body with something that can actually take action on its thinking and its memory and can do many many different tasks and can actually interact almost like you do with a keyboard and type things and click things and buy things and sell things that's the agent this is the next step in the evolution of AI this is unbelievable that we're experiencing this in our lifetimes like this is bigger than some of the developments in uh previous generations this is kind of like industrial uh Revolution but on steroids and the problem for all of us is this is all happening too quickly too fast to keep up and if you don't keep up with this unfortunately you're going to be like most people and you are going to legitimately be left behind this is hiru onoda one of the most famous Japanese soldiers who carried on fighting even after World War II was over many of them didn't even know they retreated into jungles and stuff and just didn't have any contact with outside civilization they had no idea the war was over some of them knew but they refuseed to believe it or accept it right now in the world there are many people who just don't know what's going on with AI or refuse to accept it or understand it don't be one of those so how do you actually find AI agents well the thing with AI agents and this video is a a really good example is they can do tasks like I've just shown you so this particular AI goes through your CV matches jobs online and starts applying to them so if we go through this video here you can see the AI is actually moving around the cursor clicking on buttons researching things applying for things filling out your information so literally what you would do on a computer so I hope that's like 100% clear now the AI agents they literally log into your computer and they could do stuff like you do so in theory then when I'm trading meme coins I can have an AI agent do that for me buy sell the meme coin set up the slipage decide which ones to trade in that's all coming too and there are already many different AI agents that potentially could do that but at the moment their strategies aren't great I'm not aware of any AI agent who's making amazing money trading mean coins but it will come and when it comes it's game over for a lot of other things to be honest with you because if you own that AI agent you're just printing money but let's talk for a minute about how can you make money from this so let's talk about a few different strategies you can make your own agent and then you can sell that almost like SAS software you you can actually sell that as a subscription and people can use it and maybe they find it useful that's definitely an option there you can make your agent or agent platform and you can tokenize it which is what a lot of companies are doing right now and that token in itself will have value and you could be a shareholder in that token and you could have 5 10% of that token or if anybody else creates an agent on your platform um you can take a share of that or you can charge them some salana or cryptocurrency to actually make that you can invest in AI agents that have tokens already which is what a lot of people including myself are doing now you may have heard of VCS in the early days of crypto especially you had VCS invest in projects so they will uh buy shares in this particular company or a particular token and they would hold them for a period of time and they could sell them later and usually retail would come in much later and they would make big multiples on their original investment understand now that for the AI agents around right now you are the VC this is you it's an amazing situation where you at home on your keyboard or on your phone you can invest in some of these uh tokens very early uh almost like a VCW and you could make money on them and you can wait for the value to appreciate and then you can sell them at any time cuz the good thing about meme coins or cryptocoins is there's always liquidity in any decent coin there's always liquidity so you can buy and sell anytime 24/7 24 hours a day and there are tools here like Dex screener where you have all of the different coins listed on all of the different blockchains and you can buy and sell any of these and you can see a lot of them have the word AI in them and they have different market caps and you can buy these and you can sell these and like I said very soon there'll be agents that will do all of that for you anyway which is why you have to be learning more about this now where do you find them one site I'll link these all below as well it's called cookie. fun what this does is it ranks all of the different AI agent coins and AI agent platforms on here and it gives you an idea of their mind share how much interest there is in that particular coin the thing with M cha is when a coin has more interest on social media and more attention it tends to go up in value more and more people hear about it more and more people invest in it and then eventually it gets to a peak which I call it the hype cycle and then the hype cand dies off now some coins they separate themselves from this and they keep trending upwards like fcoin for example which is still going very very strong despite many of the other AI coins um losing a bit of Interest so for example goat here which was worth one over 1 billion before has retraced quite a lot and kind of hype cycle probably over now I said earlier you don't need to be a Dev or a tech expert to get involved with any of this and make money from any of this at the moment to actually make one of these agents or one of these platforms like this wayu where you can actually launch your own AI agent it's very very difficult to make this if you have no developer experience but we're getting very close to the point where just prompts and we're just using AI you could you could potentially do this we're getting close we're not quite there yet we're getting close so if you're already a developer and you have some experience and you have a small team perhaps then this definitely could be a way to go cuz if I come here and I try and create a new agent it will basically ask me um to buy some wayu tokens first of all or to contribute some of my token to their treasury something like that that's a way that they actually monetize and create Revenue so this is very real but difficult right now the problem with this by the way is those people who are able to do this are able to launch something basic like this cuz it's not that difficult to launch a basic website have some copyrighting on it and make it look like it's a really cool AI next next best thing it's not difficult to do there are a lot of scam launches so every day on Deck screener you'll see a lot of scam ones that um run to 1 2 3 million and then completely die off probably because it's not a real AI project and there's ways to actually check this if you're not a developer and I'll show I'll give you a few tips right now so on these usually you'll get some sort of white paper documentation you might get a GitHub link as well analyze them yourself using AI don't do it yourself for example I use chat GPT all the time and I ask it to analyze some of these projects for me now all I do is I just type in a link cuz I've prepared The Prompt already and I've optimized it and stuff I just link it in GitHub or I link the document and it automatically creates this really nice table for me confirming scam potential um what the codes like easer of replication uniqueness type of project engagement any shipping updates because remember if it's a real project they should be doing regular updates to the code regular updates to on their socials regards to any changes all of that stuff and that's confirmed here too and that's what I do uh another one here this mint AI thing that was launched today and I think it reached a few million quickly um updated it on here and within a few seconds chat GPT spat all of this out and there were many issues with this one now remember it sometimes from the website you don't get all of the links so I would have to find dig out all of the other links here but sometimes they don't even share links because they don't have any because it's not a real project that's why you have to be very careful as an investor there's a lot of this going on right now because AI agents are trending and it's normal with crypto tokens and mean coins like everybody will try and take advantage that so you have to be very very careful so I suggest use AI for something like this another tip again if you've got more experience with mcoin trading now another way you can do it and again definitely take notes on on these parts is this is a new coin that launched it's called SN Ai and like I've just shown you you can use AI you can analyze some of the website and some of the other bits and bulbs and see is this a genuine uh project like what the hell is this and I mean it doesn't look great to be honest with you anyway but look it somehow ran to 3 million and then obviously dumped copy and paste the address come to this this tool completely free telegram bot and I'll link it down below and it's called trench radar scanner so the telegram name is trench scanner bot I'll I'll link it down below copy and paste it into here and you can see on SN AI bundles so if you scroll a little bit further down you can see here that there was sniping at this time slot basically what that means is early on exactly at the same time there were many wallets that bought a large amount of the Supply right so basically eight wallets here they were fresh wallets which means they were freshly funded they've not really traded before which is already obviously very suspicious they bought 21% of the supply and they spent 11 soul to buy that supply and what they would have done was bought all of that Supply very very early on let the price run up a bit and then sell everything and very likely if you look at top Traders here um a lot of these would have been uh those wallets kind kind of combined so you can see they they potentially could have made a bit of money by bundling and doing this but if you're not using the right tools you're going to get CAU out so like I said as almost as a VC as an investor or even a Trader in mean coins you have to do this kind of due diligence now once you've done all of this due diligence there are potentially some AI coins that could do very well so what are you looking for with the ones that do well in my opinion this is it so so one one of the ones that perform very well is s swarm node so SN aai is the ticker and again I'm looking at on Deck screen you can use any tool when it comes to trading meme coins for this and The Sweet Spot with any of these AI coins to buy in the really best place to buy in ideally is 3 to 5 million if you can get in there or Max below 10 million That's The Sweet Spot I see many many coins there that are legitimate projects run to 20 million no problem and then they pull back that might be the top at 20 doesn't matter because even that is a 3X or a 4X game which means let's say you put in 1K $1, 000 you could turn it into 3 or 4, 000 potentially now if you leave it to run and the coin's doing very well and it actually touches 100 million which is psychological level where you might want to take some profit anyway then from 3 million what have you done there minimum 30X 1, 000 turning into 30, 000 don't take my word for it scroll down here look at top Traders and see the multiples being made invested 2, 000 turned into 300, 000 invested 24, 000 turned into 300, 000 crazy returns and these way you see the gaps these are people who literally invested whilst it was still on pump fund before it reached bonding before it even got liquidity and six figures six figures like crazy but this is just one AI coin and there's AI coins like this launching all the time every week there's probably going to be five or 10 very strong ones like this and there will be many more maybe up to 50 or 100 weaker ones that just run to 3 million or 10 million and then pull back so much opportunity there but that's where I think the best place is to make money on AI agents at the moment it's literally using screening software so cookie. fun is one of them where you can screen on here this is useful another one I use is sentient market I'll link it down below this is useful as well because you can have a look at for example engagement how much engagement some of these coins are getting on social media right now the only problem with this is these are more established ones but even here if you scroll down you can see some with market caps that are lower like 10 to 15 million so that some with potential there and like I said I don't think I think real opportunity especially if you're on a limited budget you're newer to the space and you really want to make those multiples the opportunity is not to mess about with anything over 50 million is to try and aim for Stuff sub 10 million now obviously a lot of the sub 10 million one they're not going to make it they're not going to get to 100 but in terms of risk and reward this is the best uh for you and this is mainly where I aim to invest another way you can look for them is use coin market cap but on coin market cap click on categories when you go to categories you see they've made many many new AI categories so if you sort this by name you'll see AI Big Data AI agent Launchpad AI agents AI memes lots of AI stuff why is this it's trending like that's what everybody's investing in right now and if you click on AI agents for example and what you can do here is let's say you know what's gone up in the last 1 hour and you can see some of these have gone up 20 20% 10% Etc you can then look at these more on something like Dex screener and research them more have a look see what chain they're on at the moment and see what the situation is by the way I have a comprehensive mcoin trading program it's first link in description below I've actually added a quite large section on AI agents for 2025 I share some of the codes and prompts I use there for how to actually analyze documentation when it comes to AI agents and AI platforms launching new coins I go through a lot of the main ways AI agents actually monetize on there as well and I show you as well like H how you can actually create your own agents so if you want to learn about this in a lot more depth you can check that out but my preferred method for screening has always been deck screener and it hasn't really changed so for example if I wanted to look for salana coins that are AI agents I would click on filters here and what I would do is if I want something newer go up to anything I put 35 hours here which is fine so maybe a day a half but I'd probably put a little bit more so i' probably put 2 days 48 hours and then here market cap I don't want to mess around with anything that's gone too high already so let's put 15 million as a maximum market cap here and then a minimum market cap anything under kind of like 3 400, 000 is dead anyway so uh minimum we want to put like 300, 000 liquidity don't need to put anything too high here so we could just put something like 50, 000 leave leave a lot of of the stuff blank I just put transactions here maybe a th again just to rule out any kind of obvious scams and and leave it like that don't need to filter any more than that on dexes just click on radium click save and then click apply and now look at what where the volume's gone so where most of the volume has gone in the last couple of days and these are most of them going to be AI agents anyway CU that's what's trending at the moment that's what people are launching right now so for example this one called create and this particular one create you can see it it ran really well actually ran all the way up to 20 million massive pullback now and will it run again well how will we know this it's all dependent on whether this is a legit project this is where it gets a little bit techy but like I said use AI to help you it's going through the socials going through the website going through the documents and get Hub not you yourself ask AI to do it and have they created anything incredible here or have they is just just basically like a chatbot which you can easily create yourself using AI so that's not anything un and unique and incredible and those ones that are not unique and incredible um they're not going to make it so move on to the next one and work your way through the list and when you find one like for example this is another one called V1 you see a lot of these I've been analyzing and and reviewing and this one's struggling as well at the moment so very likely it's it's not a legit project or not anything that's creating anything new and revolutionary and amazing and that's what you have to look for and when you find them you're investing in this region 3 to 5 million typically region and always buy on pullbacks never buy on breakouts with mean coins or green candles look for uh pullbacks for example 1 million is usually a very important bounce point so if this is legit project this would be a good place that it might be able to bounce and run the reason we get big pullbacks in anything including m coins is always a lot of profit taken but obviously if more and more people realize that any particular project is not legit it's just going to dump all the way back to zero this is the problem you don't only have with mem coins you have with any crypto coins like this is even alt coins unfortunately is the same thing that you're trading on a lot of um hype a lot of narrative a lot of perception on what what might happen or could happen in the future the size of AI agents in terms of total tokens by market cup is 13 billion now just to give you an idea of flavor um nfts at their Peak reach around a 100 billion in market cap so you can see we're a good way off there A lot of the uh big tech companies they're obviously talking a lot about AI agents at the moment so people like Mark Zuckerberg obviously Google have been talking about it and others as well uh including Jensen from Nvidia and they're all trying to get in on the act now as well but the thing is this is only going to further add fire and fuel to all of the hype and just a reminder keep an eye out for tools that will help you with this process for example bubble Maps is another one I use and you can see here they've made a post about who actually owns a supply of some of these more well-known um AI agents and AI coins just remember even if large supplies are hold by held by the team and stuff like that sometimes it doesn't matter in terms of price you'll still see price um going higher if they're creating a lot of attention and bus if they keep shipping new updates and uh products price is still going to go up that's just the way it works especially with cryptocoins going to be sharing obviously a lot more content on m coins especially AI related so make sure you're subscribed and I'll see you back very soon thanks for listening
