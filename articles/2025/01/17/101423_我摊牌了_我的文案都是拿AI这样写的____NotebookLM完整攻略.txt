Content:
Hello friends, this issue has a lot of practical value. Change your habits, open your mind and make good use of the free popular AI knowledge base NotebookLM. NotebookLM was originally a small experimental product under Google, but it was created by the great god Kapa After the crazy promotion of Xi, it became popular and was once praised as a revolutionary AI product. If you also want one that can be used when you open a web page without illusion, it is also driven by the latest and powerful gemini2 and can integrate data files of different formats and sources, videos, voices, PPT, etc. The AI ​​knowledge base tool that turns scattered information into coherent and meaningful content and is extremely easy to manage. Come on, click on the collection, follow and like to learn about the latest features and practical cases of NotebookLM. First, open the homepage. This is our After you click Create Note, there are three columns in it: Source, Chat, and Studio. Source is where you can upload your uploaded data.

There are 50 sources, that is, for one topic, we can collect 50 materials. The most popular one is this blog function. Click on "Generate Podcast" and it will generate a podcast for two people to discuss your topic. You can also set a direction for the chat in advance. The tone and chat feeling are really good. Welcome to the Deep Exploration Radio. It can be said that they realize that true wisdom covers more than just a large amount of memorized data. And the latest update is that you can click this to join the conversation. Then I click this at any time and they will start to welcome me. OK, I Let me ask you something that I am interested in. What role did Elon Musk play in this? This is a good question. Yes, Elon Musk has undoubtedly been a frequent figure in topics related to artificial intelligence. He has spoken out about this matter a lot. They will actually answer you based on your question, just like in the old radio stations where you would call in as an enthusiastic audience and the two hosts would answer your question. It's really cool. Although it can only be used in English at the moment, we We can also practice English. The middle area is for us to directly talk and ask questions. The answers will be strictly organized according to the citations in the materials. Compared with Claude and GPT projects, it will directly mark the citation source and we can Click to read the original text If the data is not in the document, it will be strictly marked to indicate that it is not from the source. The overall amount of data it can accommodate is larger than projects and has more formats. Then, these four shortcut buttons can quickly generate briefings. For a summary parameter, I basically throw all the information in and click on it to get a quick overview. The FAQ will list several questions and give answers based on the information. The study guide will directly generate 10 questions based on this topic. There are 5 essay questions and a key vocabulary list for the short answer questions. Basically, all the key knowledge points are listed. What about the timeline? The major events will be arranged in chronological order. The key characters will also be listed. So which scenes will be very powerful? Let me give you some examples to inspire you. First, for content creation, our friends who are doing content creation can directly upload the news, other videos, web pages, encyclopedia materials and related reference books that you search every time, and then click on the brief. The content that comes out actually has a basic structure. If you want to talk about an event, you can directly click on the timeline. It is another clear structure in chronological order. You can even put it in Just treat it as an outline and then let a junior writer like Claude fill it in for you. It really saves effort, especially for friends who are writing about historical events. Then, if you are not clear about a specific part, you can directly ask it and it will answer your questions. It is also related to being able to jump to the original text, which gets rid of the pain of having to look for information everywhere and opening more than 100 tabs to flip back and forth in articles and videos. Secondly, there is another way to cheat. You can first think of a topic tendency and then use it as a custom prompt for generating a blog. For example, focus on a certain topic. If you don’t know what to focus on, you can first generate some common questions with one click. Usually, a piece of content follows a question. The answer is a very clear theme, just like the titles of various posts, such as " Why are teeth white? " and " What is going on? ". The content generated by this blog directly carries the feeling of telling a story. Considering the fascinating effect, we can directly export the manuscript and shrink it into the size and form you want. Friends who make content really can't do without it. Then when we do a project, you can export the project's Information Documents Just upload all the meeting minutes and click on the summary project brief. Then click on the FAQ to answer all the questions for internal handover. If it is a project description for users, then isn't this a ready-made FAQ? Answer? If you are new to this project, just upload it and click on the blog. When you are washing your face and brushing your teeth on the subway, listen to the blog about the project. Isn't it like a cyber elite? In addition, clicking on this timeline can also help You have laid out the project milestones in chronological order. Friends who work in HR and administration should really make good use of this and upload all the company guidelines you have to directly replace the original new employees. Manuals and new employee training. And this can be shared with one click so that they can ask AI directly when they have questions. It will definitely save you trouble. In addition, when you are recruiting, you can pass in your recruitment principles, and then every time you are going to interview someone, Send in his resume and tick the resume of this person, and let it help you analyze this person according to the principles, and then give you 10 targeted questions and business analysis. Financial report analysis is the whole cyber elite. Then there is personal affairs management. I really think this is a great trick. Everyone knows that there are many books on methodology, but after reading them, we don’t know how to use them or we always run into problems. I can't remember to pass the methodology book to it. Whenever you encounter a problem, you ask it about it and it will give you suggestions based on the methods given in the book. Let me give you an inappropriate example. A book called The Art of War by Sun Tzu. Assuming we are at war now, this is a whole AI Sun Tzu. So you can follow this line of thought to upload negotiation skills, pig farming secrets, McKinsey methods, or even fortune-telling books and Chinese medicine books. It is better than using your brain to figure it out. There are too many citations. There is also a very down-to-earth way of using it as your own knowledge brain. For example, if you have friends who like to collect prompt words, you can pass your prompt word library into it and go there when you have something to do. Now I'm asking, hey, I encountered this problem, which one should I use? It's ok. I also uploaded some bloggers' videos, such as Qiu Zhi's. Isn't it that when should you use which tool? If you want to know how good a tool is, just ask it anytime. But don't ignore my videos, or you'll lose a lot. I have some codes that AI can't recognize. Finally, in the field of learning, it's obvious that there are many uses. First of all, It is quantum speed reading. Everyone should know how to do it. It does a particularly good job in this regard. Secondly, when writing a paper, we drag different references into it. Clicking this briefing directly becomes a paper abstract. Of course The research agent released by Gemini2 is also very good. If you have not yet decided on a topic and you only have one direction, click on this study guide and it will organize several topic suggestions for you based on your scattered literature. In addition, no matter what subject you study, you can first upload the textbooks and course materials. Click on this study guide to basically mark out the core knowledge points of this course for you. Then you can Just click on the shortcut options one by one and you will have prepared for the lesson. Moreover, we can ask questions and review at any time, and we can also create our own notes. You can write down what you think or add at any time, and then click the conversion source to quote it as data. When you become a senior, you can click this to share it with your juniors. The most important principle to pay attention to when using it is garbage in garbage out. The quality of the data is the most important because it will strictly follow and quote the information in your data. If you think the information is useful, you must click Save, otherwise it will be gone for the next conversation. The saved notes can also be converted into sources. So, there is actually another inspiration, which is that we should pay attention to the accumulation of data in our daily life, because this is our asset. Ah, actually, I have n’t read that kind of large amount of information in full for a long time. No matter what I receive, even if it’s a bill, a report, or a random article, I will first summon AI to digest it for me. The Internet has made it very easy for humans to obtain information, but In the post-Internet era, we have already experienced an information explosion. AI will help us change the efficiency of information acquisition. Whoever uses it will benefit. Well, it's fun to grow up again. Everyone can use it in different ways. Grab it for free. If you have any great uses, please leave a message and share it with everyone. Remember to like it, remember to like it, remember to like it, remember to like it, collect it, and follow it. See you next time. Welcome to another deep dive. You could say that they recognize that true intelligence involves more than just memorizing vast amounts of data what part did Elon Musk play in this that's a great question it's true Elon Musk has definitely been a recurring figure in the ai narrative yeah he's been pretty vocal about
