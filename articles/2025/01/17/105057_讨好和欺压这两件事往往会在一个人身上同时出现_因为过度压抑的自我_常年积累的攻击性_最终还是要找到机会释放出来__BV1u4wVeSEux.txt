Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Core Ideas:**

*   **讨好 (Tǎohǎo, Pleasing) and QR (欺人, Qīrén, Bullying) Co-occurrence:** These two seemingly opposite behaviors can often exist in the same person.
*   **Suppressed Aggression:**  Excessive self-suppression leads to accumulated aggression.
*   **Release of Aggression:** This stored aggression will eventually seek an outlet, often manifesting as bullying.
*   **Self-Assured Individuals:**  People who are not prone to pleasing others and express themselves freely are less likely to bully others.
*   **Healthy Self-Expression:**  Those with healthy self-expression, who are neither subservient nor dominating, are less inclined to engage in either pleasing or bullying behaviors.

**II. Core Point:**

*   Suppressed self-expression and accumulated aggression are key drivers that lead to both pleasing and bullying behaviors.

**III. Fundamental Point:**

*  Authenticity and healthy self-expression are pivotal in avoiding both the extremes of self-effacement and domination.

**IV. Overarching Framework:**

The content presents a psychological model where the suppression of one's true self and accumulated aggression act as a central mechanism driving seemingly contradictory behaviors (pleasing and bullying) and highlights the importance of self-expression as a solution to avoid such extremes.
