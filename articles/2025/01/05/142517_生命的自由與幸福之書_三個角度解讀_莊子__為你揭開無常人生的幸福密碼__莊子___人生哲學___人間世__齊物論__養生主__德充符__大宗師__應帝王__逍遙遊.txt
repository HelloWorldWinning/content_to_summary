Description:
OK, let's break down this content about Zhuangzi.

**Summary:**

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   Laozi had two prominent students: Zhuangzi (focused on the "Tao") and Han Feizi (focused on the political application of the "Tao").
    *   The main focus is on how to read Zhuangzi’s work, specifically through understanding the author and their works.

2.  **Zhuangzi's Life:**
    *   **Poverty:**  Zhuangzi lived in poverty, not as an act but as a reality. He was a minor official then resigned to become a teacher, teaching very few students.
    *   **Arrogance:** He was proud and unwilling to serve the powerful, reflecting a cultural trend in figures like Tao Yuanming and Li Bai.
    *   **Intellectual Background:** He was well-educated, likely from an aristocratic family, and wrote exceptional articles.
    *   **Broad-Mindedness:** He inherited Laozi’s ideas, despite never meeting him directly.
    *   **Optimism:** He directly confronted life and death, believing death to be a natural part of life, and emphasized calmness in facing death.

3.  **"Zhuangzi" Book Structure:**
    *   Originally over 100,000 words, now about 60,000.
    *   Divided into three categories:
        *   **Inner Chapters (7 articles):** Considered written by Zhuangzi himself.
        *   **Outer Chapters (15 articles):** Possibly by Zhuangzi and his students.
        *   **Miscellaneous Chapters (11 articles):** Potentially by later students or even forgeries, but still interesting. Includes "Robber Zhi" and "On Swords".

4.  **Reading the "Inner Chapters":**
    *   **Order:** The order of the seven "Inner Chapters" is not as important as understanding the core concept they contain.
    *   **"The Human World":** Starts with the difficulties of living, emphasizing self-preservation and the dangers of the world. Includes the story about Yan Yuan and the need to "save yourself first".
    *   **"On the Equality of Things":** Focuses on two important ideas: "equality of all things" and "equality of all theories".  It highlights the idea of tolerance and different perspectives, using the analogy of "Zhuangzi dreaming of the butterfly".
        *     All things are equal: "From the perspective of Tao, there is no distinction between high and low in all things."
        *     All theories are equal: Emphasizes the idea of tolerance. “Everything is nothing but that, nothing is nothing but that which is invisible when it is seen from the other side, but known when it is known from the self.”
    *   **"The Art of Preserving Life":**  Uses the story of "Butcher Ding butchering an ox" to illustrate how to live in harmony with the rules of nature. The essence of it is that "Skills are close to Taoism".
    *   **"De Chong Fu":** Shows that those considered "freaks" can be spiritually complete and that inner fullness is more important than outward appearance. It emphasizes the importance of internal qualities and not judging by appearance.
    *   **"The Grand Master":** Focuses on death, portraying it as a natural rest, and emphasizes living life fully. Discusses how to deal with death, portraying it as an inevitable rest.
    *   **"Ying Di Wang":** Illustrates the concept of "non-action" (wu wei) through the story of Hundun being killed by the Northern and Southern Emperors. "Non-action" means not to act recklessly, not to mess around.
    *   **"Xiaoyao You":** Zhuangzi’s most beautiful article, expressing freedom, and the meaning behind the word "游" (traveling) and the analogy of the fish in water and Dapeng, and "forget each other in the rivers and lakes". It is about freedom and ease, and encourages seeing the world from a higher perspective.

5.  **Other Key Articles:**
    *   **"Horse's Hoof":** Uses the example of horses to criticize how the world manages individuals (like training horses abusively) and emphasizes that we should remain free like the natural horse.
    *   **"Autumn Water":** Highlights the idea that higher perspectives lead to new insights, using the story of He Bo and the Sea God and illustrates that true knowledge comes from recognizing the vastness of what we don't know.

6.  **Core Ideas of "Zhuangzi":**
    *   **General:** “We cannot change the world, we can only change our view of the world.”
    *   **More Specific:** “Viewing things with the Tao and uniting them with the Tao.”
    *   **Even More Specific:** "Equal all things, equal right and wrong, equal life and death," all of which lead to tolerance and optimism.
    *   **Modern Interpretation**: Seeing through life, still optimistic and brave to move forward.
    *   **The Difference Between Science and Poetic Perspectives:** Zhuangzi's viewpoint gives a warm and tender perspective on life that goes beyond just science and logic.

7. **Conclusion:** Zhuangzi's works aim for aesthetic and poetic freedom in life.

**Core Point:** Zhuangzi's philosophy emphasizes shifting our perception to find freedom and harmony with the world, since we can not change it.

**Fundamental Point:** The core of Zhuangzi's teaching is finding freedom through accepting the nature of the world and our place in it, rather than resisting it.

**Overarching Framework:** Understand the author, understand the book, and then understand the core ideas of the book. This is the foundation of understanding a philosophical text.

Content:
Laozi had two very good students who really learned Laozi's thoughts and wisdom. One was Zhuangzi, who mainly studied and loved the realm of "Tao" that Laozi talked about. The other was Han Feizi, who mainly liked and studied Laozi's "Tao  "Specific application in politics, so Han Feizi also explained Laozi and compared Laozi. What we want to share with you today is how to read "Zhuangzi" written by Han Pengjie. When we read a book, we must first understand  The author is "knowing people", and then we need to understand his works, which is "knowing books". Then we need to understand the most important core content of his book. Let's stop talking nonsense and read Zhuangzi 's work. To understand his works,  First of all, let's get to know this person, Zhuangzi. Let me summarize his life. I think there are several important characteristics. Judging from the time, Zhuangzi was born in 369 BC and died in 286 BC.  It is equivalent to the era of King Wei of Chu and King Xuan of Qi. These two people are familiar to everyone. King Wei of Chu was Mi Yue's father. King Xuan of Qi, the one who was fond of ostentation and was a sham player, was very famous in this era, but he lived in poverty. So the first characteristic of Zhuangzi's life is that he was poor. Zhuangzi was really poor, and this was not an act. In Chinese history, some people like  If you want to write good articles and poems, you have to live in poverty. Only then will people think you can write good articles and poems. So many people pretend to be poor. Zhuangzi is true.  How do you know it's not fake? You see, intellectuals at that time either became officials or taught. There was no other way out. Zhuangzi also started out as a small civil servant - a lacquer garden clerk who managed raw lacquer. The lacquer was not the paint we have today. It was the adhesive. Later, he stopped working. It was said that being an official was not free. He was free not to be an official. After he was no longer an official, he could only teach students. He went to Zhuangzi. It seemed that there were not many students. Why? Because I looked for the names of his students in the book "Zhuangzi". Only one student named Lin Qi was found. The other students didn't even have their names. Unlike the Analects, Confucius had three thousand disciples and among the seventy-two wise men there was the wealthy Zigong and the great knight Zilu. Confucius had two students who were very eloquent. One of them is Zigong , and the other one is the one who sleeps during the day. What kind of trouble did my teacher encounter? He is very eloquent and does not need to worry too much about diplomacy. I think Confucius is a relatively good teacher. Zhuangzi is not good, he quit his job.  There were only a few students to teach, so the family was poor. Once, Zhuangzi went to borrow grain from Jianhe Hou.  The Marquis of Jianhe is a lucrative position. The Marquis of Jianhe hates Zhuangzi very much, but he dares not offend him. Intellectuals are not easy to offend. If you offend him, he will always make jokes for you. This is unbearable. The Marquis of Jianhe said to Zhuangzi, "Zhuangzi, I don't have much food now."  In autumn, when the harvest is big, I will give you more food and more money. Is that okay? Zhuangzi told him a story . Zhuangzi is the real storyteller in our culture. His storytelling skills are so high. Zhuangzi told the story to Jianhe Hou.  The story goes that when I came here, I saw a small fish in the ditch. The fish said to me, "Look, I am almost dying of thirst . Please get me a bucket of water to save me." Zhuangzi said, "One bucket of water is not enough. I will either go."  Find the Dragon King in the lake and talk to him about getting you to the lake or the sea. You will be free there. The fish said angrily, by the time you find them, I would have turned into a dried fish. Look everyone. He never tells this story directly. He made up a story.  To express his own meaning, since he couldn't even afford to borrow food, of course, he was poor. Another thing can also prove that he was poor. Zhuangzi met the King of Wei, " wearing a large cloth patched" He was wearing a long robe with patches all over it. He looked so poor. The King of Wei asked Zhuangzi, " You are so poor." Zhuangzi said, "No, no, no, I am poor, but I am poor." Poverty is a state of life, while destitution is a state of mind. I am in a good mental state. I am like the monkey who just fell into the bushes and cannot dodge. If there is a chance for me to return to the big forest, you can see my ability. So we  It is said that the first characteristic of Zhuangzi is his arrogance despite his poverty. The second characteristic of Zhuangzi's life is his arrogance. Doesn't the borrowing of grain from Jianhe Hou that we just mentioned reflect his arrogance? People cannot be arrogant, but they can be proud. So there is such a trend in our culture, represented by Zhuangzi, Tao Yuanming, Li Bai and Su Dongpo. What is it called? "I am unwilling to bow my head and serve the powerful." Just be happy. So this is a very important branch in our culture. If we want to trace the source, we can trace it back to Zhuangzi . Didn’t Tao Yuanming say that? Zhuangzi is my teacher. You have to have the capital to be proud. What is Zhuangzi’s capital for being proud? One is Zhuangzi's background. As we all know, if he was not from an aristocratic family and had not received a good education at that time, how could he have written such good articles? Zhuangzi was born in the state of Chu, but something happened in Chu and he fled to Song. So in his writings we often see the great peng flying south to his hometown, expressing the feeling of looking back at his hometown .  What is the capital of pride? The article is well written. Among the pre-Qin philosophers, who wrote the best article? Two people, Zhuangzi and Mencius. Zhuangzi's writing is like the sea, as vast and unrestrained as the sea. Mencius's writing is like the tide. Mencius likes to use parallel sentences like the tide, and his writing is full of momentum. But Mr. Lu Xun has a more objective evaluation. He said that Zhuangzi's writing is more  It is said that "no philosopher in the late Zhou Dynasty could surpass him." What did Mr. Wen Yiduo say? He said that when you read Zhuangzi's articles, you don't know which is the beauty of thought and which is the beauty of words. There is no one before Zhuangzi who can combine thought and words so skillfully, and I am afraid there will be no one after him. Well, this is what we say about Zhuangzi.  The first characteristic of Zhuangzi is that he is poor, and the second is that he is arrogant. As for the source of his arrogance, one is his background, and the other is that he is knowledgeable and well-written. How does "Records of the Grand Historian" evaluate Zhuangzi? There is a "Biographies of Laozi and Han Fei" in "Records of the Grand Historian". It ranks third in the list of biographies. It contains more than 200 words recording the life of Zhuangzi. "Records of the Grand Historian" evaluates Zhuangzi as "Zhuangzi's learning is all-encompassing". It says that Zhuangzi's knowledge  , all aspects involve "but its essence can be traced back to Laozi". So why is Zhuangzi considered a Taoist figure?  The highest theoretical destination of his teaching on "Tao" is still his teacher Laozi. Zhuangzi was Laozi's private disciple. Please note that many people use the term incorrectly now. Private disciple means someone who has never met him. Zhuangzi was nearly 200 years later than Laozi.  We haven't met each other for many years, but he inherited other people's ideas, so he is called a private disciple with a broad mind. So we say that the life characteristics of Zhuangzi include poverty, arrogance, and broad-mindedness . What else? I think another very important thing is optimism. Why do people like to read "Zhuangzi"? Because we don't like to talk about death. Confucius also doesn't like to talk about death . If you don't know life, how can you know death? Laozi didn't like to talk about death. In fact, there are only three or four places where the word "death" appears in the Tao Te Ching. Zhuangzi is different. He faced life and death directly. Zhuangzi is the first philosopher in Chinese culture to face life and death directly. I believe that death is a part of life and there is nothing to be afraid of. We should be calm and composed when facing death. Therefore, when reading Zhuangzi's articles, we should pay special attention to Zhuangzi's views on life and death. This is a very valuable part of our culture. If we don't understand death, we won't understand what is real. So Confucius said, "If you don't know life, how can you know death?" Actually, for us now, if we don't know death, how can we know life? If we don't know what death is, we can't study this part thoroughly. We say that we know people first, and then we know books. Zhuangzi's articles originally had more than 100,000 words, but now only more than 60,000 words are left. Many of them have been lost. Later generations divided Zhuangzi's more than 60,000 words into 33 philosophical essays.  It is divided into three categories: "Inner Chapters", "Outer Chapters" and "Miscellaneous Chapters". The " Inner Chapters" are generally recognized to be written by Zhuangzi himself. There are seven articles. We will focus on the "Inner Chapters" later. There are 15 articles in the Outer Chapters, which are believed to be written by Zhuangzi and his students. The teacher guides the students and his ideas are similar to those of Zhuangzi. There is also the Miscellaneous Chapters, which has 11 articles. Some of them may have been written by later students. Some people think it is forged. Even if some articles are considered to be forged by later generations, they are still very interesting. In fact, when I was reading "Zhuangzi", there were two articles in "Miscellaneous Chapters" that I really liked. One of them is in "Miscellaneous Chapters".  The article "Robber Zhi" tells the story of a robber named Liuxia Zhi who rebelled. Confucius got angry and asked him why he rebelled. He went to persuade him to surrender. But Liuxia Zhi scolded him and he was so angry that he was in trouble. Confucius was speechless. In Chinese history, there are all kinds of embarrassing scenes about Confucius, but they are all about "being in exile and wandering", the kind of temperament that keeps on singing and playing despite being in exile and wandering. However, this "The Thief" In the novel Robber Zhi, Zhi under the willow tree taught Confucius: Confucius, you are a gossiper who is lazy and doesn't know the difference between grains. You used a lot of words. Of course, this is Zhuangzi's many descendants using Zhuangzi's name to express their dissatisfaction with Confucianism. Let's just watch the fun. There is another one.  An article, namely "On Swords", which is interestingly written and is considered to be an article by later strategists. It is also included in "Zhuangzi". Let us use this to talk about how famous Zhuangzi was back then. Many people write articles under the name of Zhuangzi. What is the story of "On Swords"? It says that the King of Zhao ignored the government affairs and liked swordsmen. He let his swordsmen fight every day and did n't care about anything else. Many people were killed and injured, and the prince was afraid.  Who should we find to persuade King Zhao? Everyone unanimously recommends Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi comes and tells King Zhao a story. He says there are three kinds of swords. One is the sword of the emperor, which has the heart of the world. The other is the sword of the princes, which has  The third kind of lofty ambition is the sword of the common people. What do you think of the sword of the common people? Staring all day long, wearing a robe and wielding a sword, he said this was not good enough. After hearing this, the King of Zhao said, " I just deal with the swords of the common people every day." Then he ignored these people. Zhuangzi advised Everyone thinks that the article "Success" is indeed not like Zhuangzi's Taoist style, but it is very interesting. The "Inner Chapters" have seven articles, the "Outer Chapters" have fifteen articles, and the " Miscellaneous Chapters" have eleven articles. In total, there are thirty-three articles. How to read  What about "Zhuangzi"?  You have to know books. Bai Juyi said it well, "I still think Zhuangzi has too many words and sentences." He wrote too many words. "Only read six or seven chapters of Xiaoyao." Just read "Inner Chapters." Of course, you can't just read it. What I mean is that everyone puts this  As the key point, I will first tell you how to read the seven articles in "Inner Chapters". I will first talk about the order of the seven articles in " Inner Chapters". The order of the seven articles in "Inner Chapters" is like this: "Xiao Yao You"  , telling the story of the great peng and the sparrow in the tumbleweeds (On the Equality of Things), telling the story of Zhuangzi dreaming of a butterfly (The Art of Preserving Life), telling the story of the butcher Ding butchering an ox with ease (The World of Man), telling how some people encounter so many dangers in life  The book "De Chong Fu" tells about some strange people, some of whom have shoulders higher than their heads, some of whom have big tumors on their backs, etc. However, their spiritual world is very full and complete, so Zhuangzi believes that they are not incomplete. Those who are healthy in appearance but mentally defective are incomplete. "Grandmaster" Da means great, Zong means leader and Shi means teacher. Who can be the Grandmaster? Of course there is only "Tao" "Ying Di Wang" How should one be a leader or an emperor? So this article tells the story of Hun Dun. Hun Dun was killed after being chiseled out seven holes by the Northern and Southern Emperors . This is the inner seven chapters. Now many of us who are talking about "Zhuangzi" have gradually discovered something. This is the ancients' Now let’s talk about how to better read these seven chapters. Inner Chapter 1: "The Human World" First, put "The Human World" at the very beginning. Why? Xin Qiji said, "The waves at the river head are not that bad, but it is difficult to travel on the human world." Zhuangzi also talked about the era he lived in in "The World of Man". What kind of era was it? "At this time, I am only exempt from punishment." It is good enough that you are not punished. We are facing so much pain and danger every day. Put this first. Life in the world is too difficult, so put this first. What important thing does the article "The Human World" talk about? Zhuangzi likes to talk about Confucius. In Zhuangzi's articles, Confucius appears much more often than Laozi. One day, Confucius saw his student Yan Yuan passing by angrily, so Confucius stopped him and asked him, "Where are you going?" Yan Yuan said, "Duke Ling of Wei is too outrageous. He has made the country so chaotic and disregarded human life. I want to persuade him and criticize him. Confucius said, "You should stop now. You are a young man with neither moral integrity nor fame. You are not worthy of the title.  Isn't Duke Ling of Wei seeking death? If you really want to be able to help others, including criticizing and blaming them, you have to "save yourself" first and protect yourself. Only when you reach that level can you do it. Otherwise, wouldn't you be throwing your life away in vain? He said, for example, you were debating with Duke Ling of Wei, and Duke Ling of Wei was listening there. He found a flaw in your debate and questioned you, what would you do? You have to answer hastily, right?  What if I say something that offends him? Wouldn’t that mean I’ll lose my life? So they told several stories like this. For example, some of them were to be teachers to the prince, and some were to be sent as envoys to foreign countries. At that time, the vassal states were considered foreign countries to them. If they said something wrong or did something wrong, they would be like a mantis trying to stop a chariot.  —The story of a mantis trying to stop a chariot comes from the article "The World of Man". So "The World of Man" should be put first. It is easy to be born, but it is not easy to live. The world of man is what we call the human world, which is full of uncertainties, ups and downs.  Danger should be put first. Since the world is so dangerous, what should we do? In the following articles, Zhuangzi begins to give us ideas on how to make us live happier in this society. Anyway, we cannot change the world, so we can only change our view of the world. So Zhuangzi wants us to make peace with nature. Make peace with society and ourselves. Since we cannot change the world, we should change our view of the world. So the following articles mainly talk about these contents. Chapter 2, "On the Equality of Things" The second chapter "On the Equality of Things" tells us  There are two important ways of thinking. One is to make all things equal, and the other is to make all theories equal. Just look at the title and you will understand. Don’t put the three together. It talks about “making all things equal” and “making all theories equal”. What does “making all things equal” mean?  Woolen cloth?  All things are equal. I really like this passage in the outer chapter "Autumn Water": Viewing things from the perspective of Tao, there is no distinction between high and low. In fact, from the perspective of Tao, there is no distinction between high and low in all things. We all come from Tao anyway, and we are all This world of equality is actually like a big family. There is a very outstanding person in Shaanxi named Zhang Zai. He has an article called "Xi Ming". In it, he said that Qiankun, that is, heaven and earth, is the main leader of our country, the parents of all of us.  , but the eldest brother and those poor people, widows and orphans are all our brothers and sisters. "People, my compatriots", everyone is a compatriot, "things, I am also", all things are equal.  It is definitely not from Confucianism but from Zhuangzi’s thought. He is also a very important figure in Confucianism, Zhang Zai, the founder of our Guanxue. This principle is what Zhuangzi said in the “Autumn Water” chapter: “Observe things with the Tao, and things are nothing.” From the perspective of Tao, all things are equal, which is called "equality of all things". Therefore, there is a very good point in Zhuangzi's "On the Equality of All Things" that equality Zhuangzi is known as the first anti-alienation philosopher in human history. We are all equal. Why do you despise others? You are born noble, you have a lot of money, you are a high official, so you despise others. So we say "Qi  "On Things" first talks about " equality of all things". Have you ever thought about this? We often talk about the story of "Zhuangzi dreaming of the butterfly". Why is Zhuangzi the only one in the world who can figure out whether I dreamed of the butterfly or the butterfly dreamed of me? We never think like this, how is it possible that a butterfly dreams about me? This is because we look at things from a very low angle. So from the perspective of Tao, there is no noble or inferior thing. From the perspective of things, we are noble and others are inferior. From our own perspective, we all think that we are noble, other species are inferior, and we humans are the most noble.  , what’s wrong with me eating this and that ? No, in fact, from their perspective, we are a strange existence. From a secular perspective, nobility and inferiority do not lie in ourselves. From a secular perspective, nobility and inferiority do not lie in ourselves at all. They all depend on the evaluation of others. That's why Zhuangzi said, "I don't care."  No matter what others say about me, I feel happy. Even if I am rolling in the mud, I feel happy and joyful, that's enough. "Qi Wu Lun", what does "Qi Wu Lun" mean? I think what Zhuangzi said about the wind at the beginning of "On the Equality of Things" is so brilliant: The wind blows in a myriad of different ways, yet it makes itself blown. All of them take what they want, so who is the one who is angry?  The word here is "blowing in thousands of different ways". Let's take a look at it. The wind blows in thousands of different ways. The wind blows on all kinds of things and makes all kinds of different sounds. But it is all wind. Are n't they essentially the same? But "咸其自取" ultimately depends on you. What kind of object are you that makes the wind make such a sound? "There are three thousand rivers of water, but I only take a sip." What kind of person do you want to be? “Who is the one who is angry? ” Anger is the instigator, so who else could be the instigator? Then isn't it all just me in the end? The wind is itself, there is no god or God that starts it. We are the same. He asked, "Look, is this wind the same wind?" It's just that the sound produced by blowing into different objects is different. If it is blown into a cup, it is one sound. If it is blown into a tall building, it is "the tall building has a sad wind". And if it is blown into a flute, it is another sound. But in essence, they are all wind. Everyone has different  We are arguing with each other on the same point, you arguing with me and I arguing with you, aren't they essentially the same?  If you want to grow old and argue with others about right and wrong, and impose your own views on others, there is a kind of coldness called my mother thinking I am cold. It is not okay to always impose your own views on others. Therefore, the most outstanding view in Zhuangzi's "On the Equality of Things" is  What is it? Tolerance Don’t impose your views on others. Why? Because everyone has a different perspective and the world changes so fast, why do you use a fixed standard to measure everything? Everyone, please read this paragraph: Everything is nothing but that, nothing is nothing but that which is invisible when it is seen from the other side, but known when it is known from the self.  You can't see this side if you stand over there. You can only see yourself if you stand over here. Everyone has different angles. I write a 6 on the table, and you see it is a 9. Let's argue about the angle here.  You can never get a conclusion even if you argue for a lifetime, so you have to be tolerant. People come to different conclusions from different perspectives. And the world changes too fast. Please read this paragraph: Life and death are the same, and death and life are the same.  It is not possible, it is not possible. Things are always changing. You cannot use one standard to measure everything and impose your own standards on others. If you don’t believe it, just say one sentence now: “Is the weather good today? The weather is very good today.  Well, that's your opinion. The correct way to say it is: "I think the weather is nice today. " If we all remove the "I think", aren't we imposing our own opinions on others? We have all formed a habit.  This is a problem. Everyone uses their own standards to measure and impose their own standards of right and wrong on others.  Did n't this cause some controversy? I think the two views in "On the Equality of Things" are very beautiful. "Equality of Things" and "Equality of Theory" The view behind "Equality of Things" is equality. The view behind "Equality of Things" is equality.  The viewpoint is tolerance. This is "On the Equality of Things". One of the most difficult articles in "Zhuangzi". " Master" means purpose. What is the most important thing for Taoists to keep healthy? It is to understand the laws of things. The most important one in "The Master of Keeping Healthy"  The story is "Pao Ding butchers an ox". How does "Pao Ding butchers an ox" teach about health preservation? Many people have not noticed that the knife in the hand of the butcher has been as good as new for 19 years. Why is it as good as new? He does not cut bones.  He did n't cut hard in the place with many tendons. He cut along the tendons with ease. You see, the job of butchering a cow was originally a relatively lowly job in the eyes of the public. He was a chef named Ding, but he was just performing the act of butchering a cow for Lord Wenhui. He has a broad vision in art and has been proficient in it for 19 years. His knife is as sharp as a new one. Wen Huijun said, "You are so amazing. How can you do that?" Then Ding told him, "You see, many chefs have to replace their knives every month because they chop bones all the time and break them. Some have to replace their knives once a year because they chop the tangled tendons hard. He said that my knife "goes into the gap with thinness". My knife is so thin that the gap between the beef bones and meat is very large, so my knife can move easily there. This is so beautiful . When it comes to health preservation, it is not only about taking health medicine,  It is not about taking supplements every day, but about understanding the laws and rules of things. So the purpose of keeping healthy is to be at ease and obey this law. What is the most important principle in "Pao Ding's Butchering of an Ox"? It is called "Skills are close to Taoism". In fact, all work belongs to the technical level, but everyone has to like this work, do this thing very happily and very freely, and others will be happy to see it. Your technology has entered the realm of Tao. So you see, there is the tea ceremony for drinking tea and the flower ceremony for growing flowers.  There are martial arts, musical instrument, chess, and so on for small skills, and finally you enter a big realm. So what is the distinction between high and low in the 72 professions?  No matter what you do, you can enter the level of Tao from the art, and enter the level of Tao from the skill. "Health Preservation" is very easy to do. This is the third chapter moved to the fourth chapter because we want to put "Xiao Yao You" at the end. When we were in primary school, we often liked to joke and call people "crippled" or "blind". Later, I felt that I was too mean because Zhuangzi's article was talking about just such people. But Zhuangzi believed that their spiritual world was perfect. Their inner potential is rich, so he doesn't need to call them this way. We call them "freaks". In "De Chong Fu", "De" means spirit, "Chong" means fullness, and "Fu" means conforming to the Tao. A person whose spiritual world is full and in line with the Tao is complete and perfect. Some people may look healthy on the outside but may have walked on the other side. The "De Chong Fu" tells a story about Zichan, a doctor in Zheng State.  He went to study in Bohun, and then he saw a classmate whose foot was missing. The man was called Shen Tujia. He told the classmate that when the class was over, either you leave early and I leave later, or you leave later. I left early, and you couldn't go with me. How could you, a person who has been punished, have the nerve to be a classmate of Zichan, the great minister of Zheng State? Then Shen Tujia told him, "Look, I have been with my teacher for 19 years. My teacher has never treated me as a disabled person who has been punished. Now we are classmates, but you don't see me from an inner perspective.  What is it called to measure my qualities from within but always measure them from the outside? You don't seek within, but seek outside. Do you have the nerve to do that?  Is this the level of Zichan, the minister of Zheng State? Zichan said, "Okay, don't talk about his education. There are many such people in Zhuangzi's articles, such as Wang Yao, whose shoulders are higher than his head, and some with a big tumor on their backs, etc. But people who associate with these people  Sometimes I go there empty-handed, but when I return, I feel like I lack a lot of knowledge. When I interact with them, I feel that I have gained a lot, and gradually I forget about their so-called incomplete appearance. Chapter 5, "The Grandmaster  》 So what is the fifth article now? It is "The Grand Master". "The Grand Master" is so profound. One is the title "The Grand Master". Great, master, teacher, this of course refers to the Tao. So how do we talk about this Tao? To talk about this Tao, one can use the help of his teacher Lao Tzu. What does Lao Tzu mainly talk about? One thing we never want to talk about in life is death. So a lot of things in "The Great Master" are about how we deal with death. Let's take a look: The earth carries me in form,  I live with ease, I grow old with ease, and I die with rest. While I am alive, you should work happily. Death is inevitable for everyone, so you should treat it as a real rest. Those who live well will also be able to die well. What does it mean? We live between heaven and earth, working happily while alive. Is death scary or not?  It's not scary, it's an inevitable part of our lives. When you die, just treat it as a kind of rest. So when you are alive, live well. When you face death, you should also handle it well. Don't panic, live calmly and leisurely. When facing death, one can also be able to treat it poetically and calmly. This attitude is really a very high state of mind. So I think the discussion of life and death in "The Grandmaster" is very interesting .  Chapter 6, "Ying Di Wang" What is "Ying Di Wang" about? Because Taoism says that being an emperor or a leader should be "non-action". The "non-action" of Taoism means not to act recklessly, not to mess around. Not to act recklessly, not to do too much, not to do something, so as not to fight for fame and fortune in the future is called "profit without competition". This is the Taoist way of doing nothing, so he created a Taoist image called "Hundun". The emperor in the center is called Hun Dun, there is an emperor in the south and an emperor in the north . The two people think that the emperor in the center is very good to us, so let's repay him. You see, this chaos has no seven holes. Let's carve one hole a day for seven days to repay him. As a result, the seven holes are completed, and then the chaos is killed. It is because the seven holes are too smart that they have the opposite effect. Taoism uses "Yingdiwang" to talk about inaction.  The inner chapter of Daoli 7, "Xiaoyaoyou" begins with "The Human World", which talks about the difficulties of life. In the middle, it talks about the equality of things and the equality of theories. How to treat the widows, widowers, and lonely people in this world with ease. Then you can achieve the three words that Taoism emphasizes most in the end.  It's called "Xiaoyaoyou" This is the most beautiful article written by Zhuangzi. It has a great influence. When you read "Xiaoyaoyou", you should first look at the word "you". Our "you" originally means walking. Because when you travel, there may not be water there. But when did the word "游" intentionally or unintentionally become three water drops? It is because "Zhuangzi" talks about "traveling the world ". The word "traveling" contains the meaning of freedom and ease. The key to understanding "Xiaoyaoyou" lies in this word. So what does he use to talk about this "traveling"? What does Zhuangzi like to do most? He fished in the Pu River every day. King Wei of Chu sent two people to invite him to be the prime minister. He also fished there, holding the fishing rod and ignoring them. Zhuangzi liked fishing. What did he like? I like to watch fish swimming freely in the water. There is an article, or a saying that everyone is familiar with, called "You are not a fish", from Zhuangzi's "Autumn Water Chapter". Once, Zhuangzi and Huizi were walking by the canal. Zhuangzi said, "Look,  The fish was swimming happily. Huizi immediately caught the flaw in his logic and asked him, " You are not a fish, how do you know the happiness of fish? " Zhuangzi said,  If it wasn't me, how would he know that I didn't know that fish are happy? Huizi said stop, stop, stop. It was Zhuangzi who said first that he knew the fish was happy. Don't worry about me, let him tell you how he knew it. This time Zhuangzi was forced into a dead end because logically speaking, Huizi's point of view was not wrong at all. We didn't  People can understand other people's spiritual world, so they shout "Who understands me" every day. You don't even understand yourself, but you always ask others to understand you. How difficult it is. So we have no way of knowing whether the fish is happy or not. Maybe there is something big underneath.  The fish chased it and ran away in fear, but Zhuangzi always wins in his articles. Zhuangzi said to Huizi, "Please follow its origin." Huizi, come here and ask me, "How do you know the joy of fish?" Isn't there two  What do you mean? , one is how, the other is where. Didn’t you ask me “How do you know the joy of fish”? Doesn't that mean I already know that fish are happy?  Did n’t I know it just by standing by the water? There is a scenic spot in Beihai Park called Haopujian. Doesn’t this come from Zifeiyu? Pu is Pu River, and Zhuangzi fished in Pu River. Zhuangzi liked the fish swimming freely in the water. Why? Because when there is too much water, the fish forget about the water. When there is little water, you have to think about the water every day so as not to die of thirst. But when there is too much water, people forget about the water. What is this called?  It is called "forget each other in the rivers and lakes". There is too much water. In the big rivers and lakes, fish never feel the lack of water. When there is less water, they must help each other by spitting saliva at each other to moisten each other. "It is better to forget each other in the rivers and lakes than to help each other with spit." Fish also forget each other in the rivers and lakes.  , where are the people? Forget about Taoism. The more you learn about Taoism, the higher, deeper, and wider your perspective will be. Having more of this is like having more fish and water. It will no longer be a limitation for you . What is the second one about fish swimming in water? Dapeng, Dapeng swims above 90,000 miles. The opening paragraph of "Zhuangzi: Happy Journey" reads: "In the North Sea there is a fish, its name is Kun. It is so big that no one knows how many thousands of miles it can travel. It turns into a bird, its name is Peng …  ...is a bird, and when it travels by sea, it will migrate to the South Sea. When the sea travels by sea, it will fly south. Please note this passage. Zhuangzi did not originally think that Dapeng represents absolute freedom, but he wrote such a thing intentionally or unintentionally. Dapeng wants to  If it wants to fly, the Peng is so big that its back is thousands of miles long. If it wants to fly, it must first have wind. "Sea transportation" means waiting for the wind to come. But if the wind comes, the wind is not strong enough or it comes...  If you are unwilling to fly, you will not have the freedom to fly later. So the second is to take advantage of the wind. The third is to fly to ninety thousand miles above. Everyone, please read Xiaoyaoyou : Carrying the blue sky on its back, the great roc flew to the nine  Thousands of miles above, carrying the blue sky, nothing can stop it. What does it tell everyone? You are below the water level every day, so what freedom do you have? You said I should have a good attitude, but you didn't even surface at that time. How can you have a good attitude? Are you always deceiving yourself? Wait for the wind to come, ride on the wind, and travel freely - the courage of the Dapeng. So what will happen? The water hits three thousand miles, and the one who rises up to ninety thousand miles. These three thousand miles and ninety thousand miles have become a kind of cultural image that we like very much. So Li Bai wrote "One day the great peng rises with the wind and rises up to ninety thousand miles." In our lives  In this world, we must be wise to avoid many unnecessary and meaningless conflicts because our life time is limited. Let's calculate how long our life is? "Seventy years of life is too short" In fact, it is good for people to live to seventy. "Another ten years of petite", ten years removed "Another ten years of aging" These ten years are also removed, and there are fifty years left "Another half is  "Sleep demon is divided" The remaining half of the time is for sleeping, which means there are only 20 to 30 years left. You said that we have such limited time to do things in 20 to 30 years. Is it meaningful to tangle with those meaningless people and unnecessary things every day ?  ? Is it reasonable? So we need to know how to be like that knife, and be able to do many things with ease, so as not to hurt ourselves by cutting bones or cutting meridians. These are the main and unexpected chapters that Taoism gives us. Of course, in addition to the seven inner chapters, there are also several articles in the outer chapters that are very  I'd also like to take this opportunity to tell you something very interesting. "Spring ice on the tiger's tail is a true learning, and autumn water on the horse's hoof is a wonderful article. " Spring ice on the tiger's tail, you have to be careful when stroking the tiger's tail, or you will be eaten by the tiger. Walking on the ice in spring, you have to be very cautious as if you were walking on thin ice. True knowledge, telling everyone to be careful and cautious. "Horse Hoof and Autumn Water Wonderful Articles" refers to "Horse Hoof" and "Autumn Water", which are the two major articles in the "Outer Chapters" that I want to recommend to you. Outer Chapter 1, "Horse Hoof"  The ancients sometimes used the first characters of an article to replace the title, for example, the first two characters. But let’s take a look at the original text of "Horse's Hoof"? These two words should not be combined together, but the ancients still used this method. Zhuangzi's observation of horses was too delicate. He said: " Horse hooves can step on frost and snow, and its hair can keep out the wind and cold." The two words "horse" and "hoof" originally meant He put the two separate parts together and called it "Horses Hooves". Everyone thought it was still about horses hooves , but it was talking about a horse that was free. What kind of person did he meet later?  His name was Bole. Bole said he could judge horses. Then he got the horses, burned them, branded them, beat them , and trained them. Most of them were tortured to death. Then Zhuangzi said, isn't this what many people do when they manage the world now ?  The horses that were originally free and unfettered are now trained like this. He said that he is good at training horses. He said that many people now manage the world just like Bole manages these horses. This is completely abusive. You see, this chapter of "Horseshoes" is so short, but it is  The theory he talked about was very interesting. He first used Bole and horses as examples and said, "Look how cute this horse is. When it's happy, it rubs its neck against your neck. When it's unhappy, it kicks its back. That's a free horse." ( Chapter Autumn Water)  Everyone is familiar with it because we all learned it in middle school. It begins with a story like this: There was a lot of rain in autumn and a flood came. He Bo looked at the Yellow River and felt very proud that the most magnificent things in the world were gathered here. Later, the Yellow River flowed into When the sea flowed to the North Sea, He Bo met the sea god. After seeing the vastness of the sea, He Bo realized the narrowness of his vision and the narrowness of his world. He sighed: "I have always been laughed at by generous people." "Generous people" refers to  He is a person who understands the great principles. What truth does this story of He Bo and Bei Hai Ruo tell us?  It means that if we look at things from a higher angle, we will have new views and new insights on many things. Many people say that they were deeply inspired after reading "Autumn Water". Therefore, the more people understand the truth, the better.  Feeling that you know less, the more you brag about yourself, the less confident and wise you are. This is the truth that "Autumn Water" tells you. Okay, this is what we call knowing people and books. Now we understand  The life of Zhuangzi is poor, arrogant, broad-minded and open-minded. The book focuses on the seven chapters of the inner chapter. Then he talked about "Robber Zhi" and "On Swords" in the "Miscellaneous Chapters" and " Horse's Hoof" in the "Outer Chapters".  "Autumn Water". After finishing these, we need to summarize so that everyone can understand the main logic here. So this is the third question: " know" "know" Have you noticed that the word we Chinese use most is probably "know", "this matter I  I know." General understanding is not called knowing. In Taoism, the "Tao" is lofty and profound. It is not easy to truly understand the "Tao". So how do we know Zhuangzi's "Tao"? If we use one sentence to summarize Zhuangzi's thoughts, it would be "We cannot change the world, we can only change our view of the world. If we use two sentences or eight words to summarize it, it would be "Viewing things with the Tao and uniting them with the Tao" ( Zhuangzi)  As for this content, we should look at the world from the perspective of "Tao" and then reach the same state of unity with "Tao" to be free and unrestrained. This is a bit abstract. To be more specific, I can summarize it in twelve words: "Equal all things, equal right and wrong"  , life and death are equal, and we are all one big family. There is no distinction between high and low. All things are equal, and everything is our friend. Don't always think that people are the absolute center. If you destroy nature, you will eventually destroy yourself.  If humans are destroyed, then only humans will destroy themselves. If you destroy your own homeland, then of course you will have no place to stand. Everyone likes the Taoist ecological philosophy. All things are equal. Of course you won't go.  Hurt it. People who love flowers are kind. Why? You have this kind of feeling towards them. Of course, you also have this kind of feeling and concept towards other things. The two words behind it are tolerance. The first one is that you can see mountains from different angles. The second one is that the world is changing fast. Just when you say something is right, it becomes wrong. Just when you say something is wrong, it may turn out to be right. So you cannot impose your own standards on others. Some people say that Zhuangzi is a cunning person who does not distinguish between right and wrong. No, he just  He is particularly opposed to the practice of using a saint's standard to determine right and wrong. He finds this very offensive and even says, "As long as the saint is alive, disasters will never cease." If you always set a standard, everyone will have to follow it. Didn't Gong Zizhen also write  Have you read "The Sick Plum Pavilion"? Everyone follows this method and makes the plum blossoms sick and weird. You have to be tolerant. Even if I strongly disagree with your point of view, I have to agree that you have the right to express this point of view. Don't express your opinion.  The two words behind "equal life and death" are optimistic. Zhuangzi's view of life and death is too good. People come from dust and return to dust. People are born with qi. What are they doing in this world? This world is like a hotel. We  You know where you'll go if you stay in this hotel for a while , so why be sad? What do I like most about Zhuangzi's optimistic thinking? There is an article called "Lie Yu Kou" in "Miscellaneous Chapters". Lie Yu Kou is Lie Zi. He tells a story about Zhuangzi who is about to die. His students are all around him. Then this student says, "Teacher, you have lived your life...  It's not easy. You died in poverty. We all gave you a grand burial. Zhuangzi said, what? How thick can you be? Have you seen, "I use the heaven and earth as my coffin" It turns out that the coffin has two layers, the outer layer is the coffin and the inner layer is the outer coffin "The sun and the moon are connected as jade disks" The sun and the moon are very big "The stars are pearls, and all things are Isn't it that the burial objects you brought to me are not complete? Isn't it that the burial objects you brought to him are quite complete? What do you do with me?  The student said, "No, no, teacher, if we ignore you and throw you into the suburbs, won't the eagles and vultures eat your flesh?" How miserable is this? Zhuangzi said, "Don't you think about this? Even if you buried me in the ground, the ants would still eat up all my flesh, leaving only my bones. I should have been the food in the eagle's mouth, but you snatched me away and gave me to the ants. How can you do this?"  Zhuangzi's biased eyes sounded like a joke, but this is Zhuangzi's calm attitude towards life and death. "Even if there is a thousand-year iron threshold, it will eventually be a steamed bun. No one can get around it. Now some people don't even have a steamed bun. We left in a flash. So  Knowing that life has nodes, we know how to better deal with the reality and the present life. So if we use modern language to evaluate Zhuangzi, what would it be called? Seeing through life, still optimistic and brave to move forward You have to read Zhuangzi's articles carefully to find this out. Many people think that Zhuangzi is negative, but he is not negative at all. On the surface, he talks about retreat and death. In fact, he is cold on the outside but warm on the inside. His eyes are cold, but his heart is still warm.  I will love spring and life. So I will use the debate between Zhuangzi and Huizi that we talked about earlier as a conclusion. Think about it, from a logical point of view, Huizi won the debate on "You are not a fish", but from a state of mind point of view, Zhuangzi won. Why? Because in our Chinese culture, we can never simply use science or logic to view all Science and logic are only a part of our lives. We can even say that they are just an isolated island. Because a lot of our lives depend on the warm hearts of people like Zhuangzi. We should not only look at the world with logical, scientific, calm and daytime eyes, but also  We need to look at the world with poetic, tender, night-time eyes so that the world can be full of interest, right? If we look at everything from a logical, scientific perspective, what problems will arise? How charming, I guess the green mountains should see me like this " Nonsense, you think the green mountains are charming, but when have they ever seen you like this? The green mountains have no feelings. If you say this, won't we lose a great perspective and poetic verses ? Li Bai  "The only mountain we never tire of looking at is Jingting Mountain" I am the only one left. The clouds have all flown away, the birds have all flown away, only this mountain the two of us never tire of looking at I am not tired of it, and it is not tired of you. If you look at it logically, aren't you talking nonsense? How do you know whether Qingshan is tired of you? We children often like to ask this question: How do you know? It is always like this in our lives.  Wouldn't that mean that many interesting things would disappear? If the world were all rigid, logical, and scientific, where would the joy and realm of our lives be? So reading is not only about gaining knowledge, but more importantly, it is about  The philosophy of Zhuangzi is aesthetics, which allows us to get more aesthetic pleasure and poetic dwelling from it. In summary, what does Zhuangzi talk about? 1 Knowing people, that is, poverty, arrogance,  Broad and open-minded 2 The seven chapters in the book of knowledge are "The World of Man", "On the Equality of Things", "The Master of Health", "The Symbol of Virtue", "The Great Master", "The Emperor", and "The Happy Journey". Then we talked about "The Outer Chapters" and "  Miscellaneous articles. 3 To know "Tao" is to view things from the perspective of Tao, to treat all things equally, to treat right and wrong equally, and to treat life and death equally. What is the realm that can be achieved by viewing things from the perspective of Tao? With the unity of Tao, everyone has such a perspective to observe things and finally achieve the aesthetic and poetic freedom and freedom of life. Regarding "Zhuangzi", we have said so much and finally want to emphasize to everyone that Laozi Zhuangzi or not, if we really read it, we will have many, many feelings, just like what Mr. Wen Yiduo said, when you throw a stone into the water, the ripples spread outwards. Just when you think you want to grasp something, it floats away again. We have endless amazement and endless multi-layered beauty . Well, this issue ends here.
