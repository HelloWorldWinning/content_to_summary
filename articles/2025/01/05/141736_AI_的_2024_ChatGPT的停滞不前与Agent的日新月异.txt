Yan Wang: Ah, I think most people have arrived, we can talk while Yan Wang: This meeting will be recorded later, but you can also record it if you want Yan Wang: OK Yan Wang: Welcome  Everyone is at super linear academy Yan Wang: Today's live event, I'm Ya Ge, today we are going to talk about AI in 2024 Yan Wang: Look, there are still some students requesting permission, I'll approve it Yan Wang  : Okay, then in today's live broadcast we will spend 50 minutes to an hour talking about technology and doing demos, and then the remaining 10 to 15 minutes  We will have time to do some live Q&A. To Yan Wang: What about this live broadcast?  There is a video recording.  After the end, we will send everyone the video, course-related materials and materials mentioned during the live broadcast. Yan Wang: We also see a QR code on this page. This is the QR code for asking questions. After scanning the code, you will see a slideshow interface where you can ask questions while the customer representative is conducting moderation.  If you are interested in any topic, you can also like it. Yan Wang: We will answer the questions that are pushed to the front in the final Q and A session. Yan Wang: Okay, Yan Wang: Let’s officially start. Yan Wang: We talked to many people this year about their attitudes towards AI and found that people's views on AI are still very divided. Yan Wang: Even more divided than last year.  What about last year?  Because charge gbt has just been released, everyone, including me, thought, hey, is it just another headline of self-media? But in the end, they found that it is useless. Only a small number of people started to use it and really explored it.  But this year we feel that the degree of division is actually more serious than last year.  To Yan Wang: Some people try hard to embrace the latest developments in AI.  I tell people this every day and it's very useful. Now half of my workload is done by AI. I feel like I can accomplish five or ten times more than before.  For example, let’s look at Davin on the right, Yan Wang: He is an AI software development intern. You can do various PVs, let him do various complex tasks, and then recruit by yourself, etc. Yan Wang: Some people think that although I use AI every day this year, the charge dpt seems to have not changed much. There is only one more model called o one and promote, but even if it is promote, you  Ask him how much salary increase he got?  He is still fooling you and trying to get you excited. Yan Wang: And this is a real chat. You can see it here. You can see the address in the courseware later. Yan Wang: Obviously, there is a huge difference between these two views.  Differences, but both are valid. Yan Wang: Later, after a period of observation, we found that general holding was of little use.  People who hold this view mainly use chat, gpt or cloud web versions or clients in their daily lives. Yan Wang: But those who think AI is particularly useful have often been exposed to the concept of agent to some extent, such as using cursor, windsurf, etc.  It’s a bit like the little man on the right. Although the time span of their understanding of AI is only a little different, because AI is progressing so rapidly, the capabilities of AI they experience are completely different.  The same. Yan Wang: This observation is very interesting. It makes us realize that although AI itself will not replace humans, if there are two people, one who knows AI and the other who doesn’t, or if they have different perspectives and methods of using AI, then  The gap in competitiveness in the workplace is actually getting wider and wider.  Yes, Yan Wang: And what about this live broadcast?  The last AI-related course we will introduce has two main purposes. The first is that we want to use demos to actually experience what we think are the earth-shaking advances in AI in 2024. Yan Wang: Secondly, we want to help everyone summarize how we should keep up with the pace of AI progress to ensure that our future becomes more and more valuable and we will not be easily replaced by others. Yan Wang: This is the main thing we want to do in this live broadcast.  Yes, Yan Wang: Here, we use an example called weekly business review. The background of it is that he and I will post the link here. Yan Wang: His background is that Amazon and other companies often use  A mechanism for Yan Wang: Every week, we get together to look at the core business data to see how much we sold this week, how many orders we have, and whether there are any problems compared to the previous week.  Progress is made and analysis is conducted on this basis. Yan Wang: How about we use this example?  It doesn’t mean that AI can only be used in data analysis, but it is mainly used as an example to demonstrate it intuitively.  Why AI has undergone tremendous changes in 2024. Yan Wang: If you have different scenarios, we also welcome you to introduce your scenarios in the last Q and A session, or in our Super Linear Academy community, and we can have more detailed discussions.  It will benefit other people in the community. Yan Wang: Let’s stop talking nonsense and watch the demo directly. Yan Wang: For a scenario like weekly business review, generally speaking, it is divided into two stages. The first stage is that there will be some databases in the company. This database Yan Wang: stores various data about our company's business operations. Yan Wang: Our business analyst or data analyst gets the data by running some secret queries in the database. This is the first step.  Acquisition of data. Yan Wang: The second step is that after getting the data, we will put it into some tools. Some companies may use super set or tableau, while some companies may use excel or google spreadsheet.  Here?  The example we used is Google Spreadsheet, but other tools are basically the same. Yan Wang: There is usually a table here, you just paste the data in, and then you can see the related visualization in another visualization tab, and then we can do further analysis. Yan Wang:  Is there any problem with the data? If so, what is the possible cause? Yan Wang: The leadership will sit together in this meeting to discuss. Yan Wang: This is the basic process of weekly business review. Yan Wang: Most companies still use a very manual process.  process, so we will use five different methods to do a business review, so as to compare different approaches, its advantages and disadvantages, and where the differences in its ideas lie. Yan Wang: In the first step, we mainly use a manual method. Its main purpose is to roughly introduce the basic process of this weekly business review?  What are the pitfalls? Yan Wang: Here is the database. Yan Wang: People usually use mods or something like that. Here we use it for the convenience of demo. Yan Wang: We don't need to worry about the details.  In general, this sqlite database has some tables. Yan Wang: And there is some data in the table. Yan Wang: For example, this is the data of a daily matrix, which has various order numbers every day.  , data such as trading volume. Yan Wang: What about us?  Our data analyst will run a ready-made super query in it. Because this is a weekly business review, he has to run it once a week, so many things are ready-made. We run it directly in it and paste the results into this Google  special, including the link to this document, we will share it with you on a webpage afterwards, and those students who are interested can also try it out by themselves. Yan Wang: Then , we update the visualization to get the latest Yan Wang: image this week, and then analyze it. Yan Wang: Now let's practice it and see how effective this process is.  Disaster. Yan Wang: For example, last week was from December 2nd to December 8th.  We want to analyze the results from December 9th to 15th this week, so maybe our first step should be to, Yan Wang: and then duplicate1 this tab, for example, December 9th to December 15th. Yan Wang: The second step is to find ours. Yan Wang: query, change his date as well.  December 8 to 12 sorry, December 9 to December 15 Yan Wang: I almost made a mistake, Yan Wang: Run it, select and copy all control c Yan Wang: Here control v Maybe for safety reasons, we can directly control  a in control v, and then go back to visualization, and make some changes here as well. Yan Wang: I didn't chart Yan Wang: Change the name of his chart to the latest December 9 to December 15 Yan Wang: Similarly, let's copy this so that it will be faster to paste it. Yan Wang: December 9th to December 15thYan Wang: Okay, then by then you may think, hey, can I just get my job done?  But as soon as you look at this picture you will find, hey, why is it so strange?  After he got here, he came back. At this time, we have to go back and check the original data, and we will find that it seems that we pasted it wrong. There is a line missing. Yan Wang: What about this side?  The first line has a Yan Wang: header, but we didn't paste it there, so we have to go back and paste it back, and then come back here and press command c, command v to get back to Yan Wang:. Then we find that,  Now the graph looks normal, and the date is indeed the date of the new week. If you hand it in directly like this, your boss will scold you because the date has not been changed. We still have to manually change it to  .  December 9th Yan Wang: By December 15th, yes, Yan Wang: After you have modified this, we finally have a basis for analysis.  On this basis, we can do further analysis. For example, if you look at the red line, the transaction volume, you will find out why the transaction volume on December 13 was so large. Yan Wang: What exactly caused this spike?  What caused it?  Then we need to do more SQL analysis and write SQL queries to figure out why this happens.  For example, we need to go back and see what the data structure of each table is like, what is the type of each column, and what is its name?  On this basis, we write a SQL query and then conduct further analysis. Yan Wang: We will not show you how to write SQL queries in detail here, but basically you can have two impressions.  First, it is very easy to make mistakes. Yan Wang: Just like we made several mistakes in the demo just now, the second is Yan Wang: How fast and how well you do this depends largely on  As for your knowledge of SQL and this database, if you don't make mistakes when writing SQL and know its syntax carefully, you can do it quickly and well. Yan Wang: But if, for example, you are not familiar with the name of the database table, this is called total visitors, and you missed an s, then you have to spend time debugging what is going on?  So Yan Wang: How well you do your job depends largely not on how deep your thinking is, or how insightful you are about data analysis, but on whether your super is a rat.  Are you very careful and down-to-earth? Are you willing to spend time on it? This is indeed the quality of talent that companies traditionally emphasize. Yan Wang: So this is the first Yan Wang: approach, Yan Wang: and on this basis?  We have finally arrived in 2023.  See the second approach. Yan Wang: The second approach is based on charge bpt or cloud web ui. Yan Wang: In this case, for example, we don’t need to write SQL queries ourselves anymore, and we don’t need to do visualization ourselves anymore. Yan Wang: We asked gpt directly, hey, can you help me write an SQ query to count the key indicators from December 9th to December 15th.  But if you ask him this question directly, it is obvious that he has no background information and he definitely cannot write it, right?  So we need to construct prompt words. Yan Wang: We need to think in reverse. If we want him to write such a query, what information do I need to give him? Yan Wang: Obviously, he needs to know the information of the related tables.  The name of the table, know what columns this table has, what each column does, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. Yan Wang: The simplest way to give him this table information is to  That is, we go back to the database and right-click the table in the data structure. There will be a copy create statement. If we paste it directly here, it will be displayed. This is the statement used to create this table.  cq statement, this statement is very informative. We can see, hey, it has the type of the column, the name of the column, and even foreign keys, which are very useful. Yan Wang: So a very simple way to build a prompt is to paste the create statement directly into it, and then let charge gbt or cloud help us write an sq query. Yan Wang: Then the rest is relatively simple.  .  When we construct prompt words reasonably, chargebd is able to complete our task very well. For example, we can directly copy and paste Yan Wang: here Yan Wang: sql, query all selected, paste,  Wait.Yan Wang: Press Enter.  Well, he can automatically get these data for us, which means his query is not written incorrectly. Yan Wang: Here?  If we select all again, copy and paste it back.  I have pasted it here and said that I ran it on the database. This is my result. Can you help me visualize it?  In this case, we should not manually transfer it to Excel or Google spreadsheet, accidentally transfer it to the wrong place, and then manually change the title and do various things. It can help us make an interactive visual display.  .  For example, here we use a function called "Look at Newta". It directly draws four pictures for us. Its basic principle is that it generates an HTML.  ?  Visualize the data.  We can see that, on the one hand, it is more flexible than Google Spreadsheet. For example, it can be turned into four graphs. In the past, if I wanted to make four graphs, I had to click hard. But now, he can directly tell him one sentence at a time.  It can produce four graphs. Yan Wang: Secondly, it is interactive. When you point the mouse at something, it will immediately give you the actual number. Yan Wang: In addition, Yan Wang: And this thing is also very helpful for our analysis. Yan Wang: For example, in this bar chart, we can easily see.  Hey, why are you so tall? Yan Wang: Is there any problem?  What happened on December 13th that caused such high sales? Yan Wang: Chat GPT is not only helpful for visualization, but also can be used for other things, such as helping us with analysis. If we want to understand the order situation and why there are so many of them, we need to further analyze them.  For example, instead of writing the query myself, I might as well ask him, can you help me check the order status of different channels on December 12 and December 13? At the same time, because it involves channels, we also need to use the method just now to  The information related to this table is given to him as background. Yan Wang: On this basis, he can then write queries.  You can see that this query is actually quite complicated. Then we paste this query in and run it again to visualize it. After this visualization, we can have a clearer understanding. For example, here  You know, once you compare, you will find Yan Wang: There may be some possible reasons, and he will even help you do some analysis. The direct channel is obviously higher than the email channel, and both indicators have improved, etc.  And so on and so forth. Yan Wang: And I think another funny thing about the demonstration is that you can actually give him some more flexible requirements in Google Spreadsheet, for example, I want to adjust the color ratio, or  Table and chart styles, Yan Wang: This is quite troublesome. You need to know roughly how to do it. For example, if you right-click, there seems to be a format options, and then go to a certain second Yan Wang: In this case, we customize and then find a third-level menu in a second-level menu. It is very troublesome to click it. But if you are using chat gpt or cloud  If you tell him directly that it is not a good idea, he can then say that it may mean that I need to change its color schema or make some other changes, such as enlarging the size of the chart.  Improve readability, optimize font size, add floating prompt information, etc., etc., etc. Yan Wang: So it is quite convenient to use it to make such changes. Yan Wang: Okay, this is the second method,  Let us summarize this approach.  Compared with the purely manual method, it has two advantages. The first advantage is that it does not have so many manual steps, so its error rate will be lower and the probability of making mistakes will be lower.  On the other hand, its efficiency is much higher. Yan Wang: We basically don’t need to write super here.  This super is not written by us, it is written by gpt.  In this case, he can Yan Wang: greatly increase the efficiency of our work. Yan Wang: But we still need to know the underlying information of the table, and we need to know how to construct prompt words. Yan Wang: We need to think in a very low-level way, and we can’t spend all our energy on really analyzing the data.  , this is a shortcoming of his in decision making. Yan Wang: If you only use gpt or cloud webui, that’s it.  It also did not improve throughout 2024.  Even if you look at OpenAI's demos yesterday and today, Yan Wang: You will find something very interesting, most of their time is not spent on demoing their functions, they are cutting various apps over and over again, and  Paste gpt's Yan Wang: answer to other apps, and then paste other F's answer back after the other apps run. Therefore, Yan Wang: this method is very inefficient.  How do I solve this?  There is a method, Yan Wang: Here we need to introduce a new tool called agent Yan Wang: What about agent?  It is a very interesting tool. Let’s get to know it step by step. It has two major elements. Let’s get to know it in two steps.  The first factor is Yan Wang: LM or AI needs the ability to use tools.  For example, I am using an AI tool called Open Web. Its GUI is running on localhost, which means it is running on my local MacBook. : Why use this tool?  Because it is an open source tool, it allows us to do some very low-level customization of LM without being limited to some restrictions set by OpenAI. Yan Wang: It allows us to understand the agent more easily, or to say, the usage behind it.  What happened. Yan Wang: Another benefit is that many students have such needs. What should I do if the data in my company cannot be sent to OpenAI or Aesopic due to financial, legal or privacy requirements?  A possible solution is to run a large model locally without leaving the local machine. Yan Wang: We also use this example, open webui, to demonstrate this to everyone.  What does a model, general framework and experience look like? Yan Wang: OK, let's go back to LM. Here, we use a model that is not too big. It is 10,002,000.5. We use the 7B model here. Let's say hello to it.  After confirming that it is really working, we can let it do a LM. The problem that everyone will face is very painful. Yan Wang: Give everyone a math problem. Yan Wang: For example, I just typed it randomly. Yan Wang: sure. Yan Wang: At the same time, let’s use Python to calculate and see what the correct answer is? Yan Wang: If we use Python to calculate it, we will find that, hey, it is this number, its last five digits are 21928. Yan Wang: Then looking back, he calculated that it is 44088, which is obviously wrong.  Well, this is a long-standing problem for LM. If you ask him to do some math, he will most likely not get the math right, especially when it comes to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of large numbers.  What about this?  It is LM, which is a very basic limitation. It does not mean that Yan Wang: we can do it well if we put our strength into it. It is because LM is next token prediction.  This principle determines that it is difficult to solve this problem. What are the specific details?  We don’t have a table for now, but if it is a human, do you have any way to solve this problem?  For example, as a human being, if you ask me to do mental arithmetic, I cannot solve the problem. But as long as you give me a calculator, I can figure it out when I input the information on the calculator, right?  So there is actually a very simple way to solve this problem. Just give LM1 a calculator.  So here we give him a computer and see if he can do it.  For example, Yan Wang: Create a new chat Yan Wang: Let him calculate this for me, yes Yan Wang: Help me calculate Yan Wang: This, but before we press Enter, let's enter this plus sign Yan Wang: In our tool there is a calculator, check it, Yan Wang: and then click send message.  In this case, what happens in the background is that we will give rm1 a new tool, Yan Wang: and tell him that the name of this tool is calculator, and what it can do is, Yan Wang: help you  Do the calculation, and then he knows from this description that in this case, because I am doing a calculation problem, I need to use the computer as a tool. Yan Wang: We will immediately say what the specific principle is, but we  Let’s take a look at this result first. Yan Wang: 21928 Yan Wang: 21928 is exactly right. It took us just a few seconds to solve a long-standing problem in LM. Yan Wang: This is also the first element of the agent, the tool. Yan Wang:  So what exactly happened behind this incident?  In fact, it is very simple. There is a tool in this workspace. We create a tool called calculator.  If we click more edit, we will see its background implementation. Yan Wang: It is a simple Python program consisting of three parts. What is the first part?  We introduced to arm what he does Yan Wang: calculate the result of an equation Yan Wang: using the tool when s to do calculation.  Call this tool when you want to do calculations.  The second thing is that we explain to him, if you want to call it, what form should you use?  It accepts only one parameter, which is a string and the content of the parameter is the equation to calculate. Yan Wang: The third thing is that we actually used Python to do the calculations for him, and after the calculations were completed, we used return to send the results back repeatedly. It was that simple. Yan Wang: In this way, we communicate with LM and enable him to use an existing tool to complete the task. Yan Wang: Then why should we use this tool? Yan Wang: This is because Yan Wang: Database is also a tool. Here I have written a tool for you called super light access agent, which is on open webui dot com.  I have already made the fax public above, so everyone.  You should not be able to see this tool on your open webui, but if you go to this URL, which we will share with you later, click get, it will be downloaded to your open webui.  Now let's try this tool. Yan Wang: For example, we first enable this tool called super light access agent. Yan Wang: Then ask him, Yan Wang: How many tables does your super light Yan Wang: database have? Yan Wang: He will call this tool to take a look at the database he has connected to?  This is the database we have here. Yan Wang: Here we can see that it has five tables, channels, customer types, etc., etc., etc. Yan Wang: He also said it here.  , there are five tables, channels, customer types and so on and so forth and so forth and so forth, indicating that it has indeed successfully connected to our database. Yan Wang: Then next, we can use natural language to ask him, please show it to me.  For example, Yan Wang: daily matrix. Yan Wang: the first ten rows of this table Yan Wang: here, the Yan Wang: agent we provide him can not only list what tables he has  , Yan Wang: What table is this?  It also has a function that can execute the super query it wrote. Is that right?  He wrote a super query, but he did not execute it.  I asked him again, Yan Wang: Help me execute it, Yan Wang: See if he knows how to execute this statement and return it. Yan Wang: Okay, he really executed it and got this table. Yan Wang: This is very useful for our data analysis, because Yan Wang: at this point, we don’t have to test between databases and analysis tools at all.  If the second method allows us to avoid having to go back and forth between gpt and excel, the third method will allow us to complete all operations in this chat interface. Yan Wang: There is no need to copy the data into the database and then test the results back. This is very useful.  To save time.  Below we will not demonstrate one by one but go directly to what we have done before.  Hello, chat records one by one, Yan Wang: Where is it here?  Mainly because this model is running on my MacBook and it is still relatively slow, it takes some time. Yan Wang: Let's take a look at this chat record, the first few are the same Yan Wang: Ah, there are several tables  , what is the data structure? Yan Wang: If you want to see how the first five records of the daily matrix should be written, edit the command and see the results. Yan Wang: These are all the same as before. Yan Wang: Then the next core is to write a SQL query here to help me calculate it.  The total revenue, total order quantity and average price for each day from December 9 to December 15, 2024. You may need to join 1 with dates to get the actual date. Then he wrote it out for me. What about this?  In fact, it is the same as the previous method, but the biggest difference is that here we just say execute, and it executes, and after execution, we get the result. Yan Wang: That's because he already has the latest result,  So we can directly tell him to use HTML to draw a line chart for me and divide it into three separate charts. Yan Wang: Then he wrote an HTML.  Here, because openwei has a function that can directly preview the content of this html, let's see how to preview it. It should be here Yan Wang: artifacts, Yan Wang: So we can directly see the Yan Wang: line chart here,  And we can also see that there is a sharp peak in food revenue. Now we can ask him why this is the case, just like in the second method in Poe. Can you continue to help me write secret queries and run them?  Visualize and follow the clues step by step to find the actual cause. Yan Wang: OK Yan Wang: Let me take a look at this question. Yan Wang: Yes, this is an agent that I made myself. Yan Wang: We just gave you the URL. You just need to go to that URL and click get. Yan Wang: How do you know what each column represents? Yes, we currently understand it through the column name, but 11,000 is a bad start, and it really doesn't work, but there is a good thing about it. Yan Wang:  In this agent, Yan Wang: What we return is actually natural language. Yan Wang: So, Yan Wang: you see he said query executed successfully below is the actual result blah blah blah, so we can definitely add some personal comments or annotations here and tell him  Hey, this column has this name and this meaning, it's all fine, so this is very flexible, it all depends on how you implement the agent? Yan Wang: We will always have this URL when we come back. Yan Wang: I will post this webpage now. We have prepared a website, Yan Wang: which contains the current courseware and all the links mentioned. Yan Wang: We will also upload the video courseware and  This URL was sent to everyone via email. Yan Wang: Okay, this is the third method.  We have already seen the obvious benefits of this third method. We can complete all the work in one place. Yan Wang: And Yan Wang: Not only do we not need to know how to write CQL, but Yan Wang: we even  We don't need to know the specific information of each table, but we still need to know some interface knowledge, for example, I need to break down the problem into small details, let him write a SQL query first.  Come out, and then let him execute it and so on and so forth and so forth and so forth and so on. Yan Wang: In this case, Yan Wang: You may ask, why?  Why do you have to treat it as Yan Wang: Each problem is so finely divided, yes, Yan Wang: This is a limitation of open webui. It is still in a stage of rapid development. At present, it has a limitation.  In each round of dialogue, I say one sentence to him and he replies to me. This is a round. In each round, he can only call agent Yan Wang once: or tool once. This is a Yan Wang  : Very Yan Wang: The limitations of Shuang show that it is still an intermediate form of the product and it may be improved soon.  However, this forces us to break down the problem into small pieces that the agent is capable of completing . Yan Wang: Yes. Yan Wang: In fact, this is where we spend most of our time. Yan Wang: We can’t spend most of our energy on data analysis. Yan Wang: What if the agent is able to tell me What changes will it bring if you can call multiple Yan Wang: tools?  Then let’s take a look at Yan Wang: The fourth method. Yan Wang: What is the fourth method?  We use cloud cloud desktop, not cloud web ui. Yan Wang: Here Yan Wang: He has the second element of agent.  Remember that the first element is the ability to use tools, and the second element is the ability to make multiple decisions.  That is to say, in the past, you could say that openwebui was a kick-and-go move. Yan Wang: Each convergence could only use one diagram, but now it is a step-by-step process. Yan Wang: Here it uses six tools  ability. Yan Wang: It includes creating a new table Yan Wang: description, a table, Yan Wang: listing all tables, making a readable or writable sql query and so on and so forth and so on and so forth.  We have already connected cloud desktop and our super light in the background. Yan Wang: Here, we can directly ask him, please introduce it to me. The super light database is of course the one you have at hand , otherwise what is the database he introduced to me?  , Yan Wang: And then?  He said, let me check the structure of the table in the database first, he wanted to say, hey, I want to take a look Yan Wang: here. Yan Wang: For security reasons, Yan Wang: an anthropic requirement, we need to manually approve at least every new round of chat, we have approved it now, Yan Wang: After approval, Yan Wang: we can  I saw him execute something first, to Yan Wang: listed all the tables, but he didn't stop.  He uses the results of executing this tool to perform other tasks.  Say describe the first table, then describe the second table, and go through each table.  Next, answer our questions based on this information.  It has five tables. The first table, daily matrix, contains what information, Yan Wang: leah, Yan Wang: and it is also found that the design of this database adopts a new model, etc., Yan Wang  : This is very convenient, isn't it? Yan Wang: It saves us a lot of time in the open webui. If we simply guide him to do these step by step, I will have at least five or six different prompts. Yan Wang: So secondly, Yan Wang: This is his first advantage.  In fact, there is an even greater advantage. Yan Wang: When you have two tools, the value they can create through combination is far greater than two times the value you have one tool.  I just told him here, can you help me look at the core indicators from December 9 to December 15? Yan Wang: Visualize it Yan Wang: Just one step, I don't need to tell him, can you help me first  How to write super query? How to help restrain Yan Wang: How to do it? Yan Wang: We are actually just Yan Wang: This requirement is more about what you are going to do, rather than how you are going to do it like in the open web ui. You see, what he did is also very interesting. He first wrote  A SQL query came out Yan Wang: I ran it for a while, but found that it failed. Yan Wang: Then he said, sorry, let me modify the query statement, and he modified it directly without our manual intervention, and it was successful. After the success, he wrote a visualization with the same HTML so that we can visualize it. Yan  Wang: This has greatly expanded our capabilities. It has not only simplified our workflow, but also greatly expanded our analytical depth.  For example, he just grabbed these things. Yan Wang: And indeed, these sales indicator trends also show a spike. Why is that?  Now we can go a step further and ask him, please help me compare. Yan Wang: December 12 and December 13 Yan Wang: to Yan Wang: sales situation, you see what we are talking about now is becoming more and more vague, Yan Wang: has changed from the previous talk about charge gpt to step by step  It’s very clear. Yan Wang: It gradually changed from how to what? Yan Wang: So he did a detailed comparison and visualization. He wrote a lot of complicated stuff and got a fairly comprehensive visualization.  Comparison of new and old customer indicators and comparison of revenue from various channels, Yan Wang: Based on these. Yan Wang: With the most basic visualization and the insights it provides us, we can do a pretty good analysis. Yan Wang: So here, we have basically Yan Wang: : Not only the level of convenience, but also the quality of the work done, and the level of abstraction of our cognition of how to use AI have been raised to a fairly high level.  Now let's take a look at the problems. Yan Wang: The third method is integrated, integrating the functions of the agent written in LM code.  In fact, Yan Wang: Code writing is not an agent. The code is written offline by us, but although it is indeed written by AI tools, in this example, its role is not code writing. Code writing is rm Yan Wang: Then backend lm and tool, this is in the course, we have a very detailed introduction, it has various combinations, different combinations are suitable for different scenarios, Yan Wang: This is  A big topic, Yan Wang: Then Yan Wang: In fact, you can use python function to define the tool in webui.  Yes, it's that simple.  Moreover, this can also be written using AI.  Actually, those calculators, including how to access light, were not written by me. I wrote them by exploiting AI. Yan Wang: Why use cloud instead of other LM? Because MCP currently only supports cloud desktop.  Our desktop mcp does support some agents, but it still does not support mcp. Yan Wang: The demo was conducted many times. Is the process similar every time?  Yes, the process is similar every time. I can show you this demo. This demo is actually very stable. Yan Wang: It’s the same every time. Yan Wang: They are very similar, so I think cloud is still very reliable.  The spectrum, especially for problems like editing, writing editing or writing programs .  For current AI, such as cloud3.5summit or o one meaning, it is already very mature. Yan Wang: If there are many databases and the tables are very complex, can it be calculated?  I haven’t tried this but I think it’s a good exercise. You might as well try it with your own data or generate some fake data.  I am also very curious. Yan Wang: How does mcp connect to the local database? Yan Wang: There is an MCP tutorial on the website in the link in the post. Yan Wang: There is a very detailed tutorial on that document. Yan Wang: Okay, Yan Wang: Due to time constraints, we will stop answering questions here for now. We will look at the questions from the slide off and answer them at the end. Yan Wang: Now you may be curious  I mean, you have already achieved so much, is there any room for improvement?  Is that right? Yan Wang: You see, we typed these few sentences from the beginning to the end, and then produced such detailed data. What we actually did was mainly like this. Yan Wang: It is very useful with AI.  Abstract language dialogue, Yan Wang: Then he gives us the graph Yan Wang: Or data, we do analysis based on the data, write a report, take a screenshot of the graph, and that's basically it, Yan Wang: How else can we do it  Okay?  Now let’s take a look at the fifth method, I hope it doesn’t scare you. Yan Wang: The vaccination method is like this. Yan Wang: MCP, or cloud, has a limitation. What is this limitation?  It is MCP. This protocol is very complicated. Let me first introduce what MCP model context protocol is. It is an open standard protocol for introducing your tool to AI. It stipulates that if you want to introduce  What can this tool do? How to use it? Yan Wang: How to implement it? You need to follow a certain sequence and syntax. This is what it does. Yan Wang: This way, for example, when there is no such protocol,  , I wrote Yan Wang: agent for open webui. Other people and other tools cannot use it. For example, cloud cannot use what I wrote for cloud.  It cannot be used, but if everyone follows this protocol, then the agents can be used interchangeably.  Just like the sockets we have now, at least in China, sockets are interchangeable, although they may be different in different countries. Yan Wang: But he has another problem, which is that it is cumbersome.  If you have ever written an MCP server, you will find that it requires writing many modules. Yan Wang: One step at a time, and there are all kinds of concerns. So far, the implementation of MCP is still very limited, or the tools that can be used by cloud are still very limited. Yan Wang: So how do we solve this problem?  Is there anything simpler than speaking?  Why don't we just use speaking methods to create an agent to expand the functionality of an agent agenda ai?  So here is what we do, Yan Wang: For example, Yan Wang: We use cursor here Yan Wang: What about Carson?  You can tell him Yan Wang: Just tell him that he can use the following tools. For example, LM has a tool, web browser has a tool, search engine has a tool, and so on. Yan Wang: This greatly simplifies his Yan Wang: It has been realized. Yan Wang: There are more tools available.  What about the other side?  The Cursor itself is an editor, which we will soon see, and this will also bring him huge benefits. Yan Wang: Well, let’s stop talking and take a look.  The fifth method is how to complete our task. Yan Wang: To make us type faster.  Here we will demonstrate a small tool that I made myself. Yan Wang: Let's try it first to see if this small tool works normally. Yan Wang: After it works better, it can do voice recognition immediately.  It is working normally, and real-time gpt is used behind it. We will introduce it again when we have the chance.  But here we use it to enter our prompt. Yan Wang: I now have a circle light database. Yan Wang: Its file name is ecommerce underscore data to db. I now want to make a weekly business review for our off director. Yan Wang: Can you take a look first?  The content of this database, and then help me write a draft, yes, Yan Wang: Pay attention to visualization.  Our director prefers to see visual things. Yan Wang: In addition, the date I am interested in is from December 9, 2024 to December 12, 2024. Yan Wang: Okay, let's take a look and it will come out. Just paste it in. Please note that you must type in the agent here.  Mode, Yan Wang: Then let’s see if there are any typos, Yan Wang: Because we org push off, Yan Wang: Then visualize.  There is no problem on December 9 and December 12, 2024. Yan Wang: Just click submit, and he said okay, let's do it step by step. Yan Wang: He wrote a script first, Yan Wang: Let me take a look  To Yan Wang: This database Yan Wang: Okay, seeing that he called this script, he already understood the structure of the database.  Now he generates another script to generate a weekly report. Yan Wang: You can see the whole process. I, I didn’t do anything. Yan Wang: He analyzed the problem himself and made a plan. Yan Wang  : Promote the implementation of this plan step by step.  He knew that if I wanted to analyze the data, I needed to understand the contents of the database first. Yan Wang: So he wrote a program to accomplish this goal. After completing the goal, he Yan Wang: further Yan Wang: based on Yan Wang:  The content output by this program, and then write the code, Yan Wang: Let’s see that it has been written. Yan Wang: This is general.  Report to py, he wrote more than 100 lines of code, wow, this is asked me to write, it is estimated that it will take at least half an hour, and then generate a Yan Wang: A weekly report is generated here containing the following content, I seem to have a place  I didn't tell him, let me tell him, Yan Wang: Put this draft into a mark down file and remember to embed the visual chart so that I can see it easilyYan Wang: OKYan Wang: Let's see himYan Wang:  Can you help us do this? Yan Wang: I will help you create a complete mark file report. Yan Wang: We accept the changes here. Yan Wang: This is another program written by it.  The program used to view the database checks it out. Yan Wang: This is what it generates.  Mark this down. Yan Wang: Let’s preview it so we can see it more clearly. Yan Wang: He said that the key performance indicators have come up with various key indicators, Yan Wang: Then Yan Wang: looked at the daily revenue trend Yan Wang: made various visualizations Wow, this speculation is too ugly Yan Wang:  Then I did in-depth analysis, trend analysis and other analysis. Yan Wang: But I found that I must have made a typo or something. It should be December 15th, not December 12th. Yan Wang: I wonder why it ended on December 12th.  It turns out to be my country Yan Wang: Sorry, we should be polite to AI, and such revolution will be better for us. Yan Wang: See the ai merit, Yan Wang: What I want is December Yan Wang: 9th to December Yan Wang: 15th, Yan Wang: Then he will go to see, Yan Wang: Just change a few lines to Yan Wang: CodeYan Wang: Regenerate, Yan Wang: Okay, it’s fixed, Yan Wang: Next we will assign it another task. Yan Wang: Look at December 13th, Yan Wang: Why is there a spike in revenue? Help me analyze it and pay attention to the depth. Yan Wang: Also, your color scheme is too ugly, change it for me, Yan Wang: Okay Yan Wang: Let me take a look, Yan Wang: He continued to optimize his code.  I see how long his code is now. Yan Wang: Wow, Yan Wang: It’s still this long, about the same length . Yan Wang: In the middle of this process. Yan Wang: Actually, there are a few interesting observations . First of all, you see , we talk to him, but Yan Wang: it is already very advanced.  See, we never said the word "shock" from beginning to end. Yan Wang: This is very interesting. Yan Wang: And what?  We Yan Wang: communicated with him, and Yan Wang: mainly did three things. Yan Wang: The first thing was to define the problem, and Yan Wang: told him that we were doing a business review. Yan Wang: It  The audience or reader is the director. We need a certain date period. This is the first thing.  The second thing is to check whether his task is completed well. Yan Wang: For example, we found that you didn’t notice the peak on December 13th. Yan Wang: Please check it for me in detail. Yan Wang: I didn’t tell him how to do it. I just told him what to do. Yan Wang: What about this?  It is a typical management. Yan Wang: Then let's take a look at the new image it generates. It changes the color scheme. Yan Wang: Then there is input trend analysis Yan Wang: Visualization Yan Wang: The following key factors, Yan Wang: Channel input, distribution, etc. Yan Wang: This is still okay.  But, he may have missed something, I want him to help me take a look and search Yan Wang: December 13th Yan Wang: 2024 Yan Wang: Did anything happen?  Is it possible that some external factors caused the sudden change in revenue? Yan Wang: Let’s see. Is it possible that we don’t need to search for it ourselves? Let’s ask him to search for it. Yan Wang: Then he found that it was the second day of Double 12. It could be  This influence Yan Wang: Don’t make up stories, just search it. Yan Wang: At this time, Yan Wang: You also have to Yan Wang: We can see that it is still an evaluation of his work, Yan Wang: and. Yan Wang: Do an assessment and nudge him to tell him how he improved the quality of his work. Yan Wang: Okay, he found some incidents, and then he noticed that he didn't report directly, so he checked the actual data in the database.  Verify to confirm Yan Wang: Is this the reason? Yan Wang: This is indeed a very good employee, I think Yan Wang: What's next?  After waiting for him to finish, Yan Wang: Hey, he found out that he was dead. What happened after that?  He went to the site to modify the code so that he could execute it. Yan Wang: While he was doing this, we actually discovered a problem, which is that this thing is still too Yan Wang: too detailed, or if you give a take lead or an analysis  Teacher, this is a pretty good report, but if I take my shopping behavior more seriously, but if you show it to a director, he might think why are you showing me such detailed things, so we  I still need to talk to him again about how to present data? Yan Wang: Please note that the readers of this report are directors and leaders. Can you make it more suitable for leaders to watch? Yan Wang: For example, in Yan Wang: your order should be considered.  The most important thing is, Yan Wang: Put the most profound content at the front, Yan Wang: You can follow similar rules for the others, organize them Yan Wang: Good Yan Wang: one more contact. Yan Wang: Wow, his emotions  The value is maximized. You are right. Yan Wang: He started reading the draft just now and reorganized it. Yan Wang: Okay, he reorganized it. Yan Wang: Business core insights. Major discovery of the week 2. Yan Wang: Strategic opportunity analysis  Wow, I don’t know if this is what we actually want, but it does look very suitable for leaders to see. Yes, Yan Wang: Finally, there is an appendix data visualization. Yan Wang: Of course, there is still a lot of room for improvement in this report, but due to time constraints we will stop here for now. Let us summarize and see what happened just now. Yan Wang: What about in the middle of this process? Yan Wang: We just mentioned that we never mentioned the three words "sql". We talked to him completely from the mindset of a manager. This is a very interesting aspect. In addition, This is better than a human manager, because many times how big a group you can manage is often not determined by you, not by your personal efforts, but by the course of history.  For example, if the company has only two heads, even if you can manage ten people, you can only manage a team of two people. Yan Wang: In this case, AI can solve this problem very well, because cursors like ours  Just now we saw that it is fully automatic. You only need to give it a command and it will do the work on its own. Yan Wang: So during this process, you can do other things.  For example, if you open ten curls windows, as long as you can manage them, you can open ten kursa windows, so it is not only our role that becomes a manager, but also becomes one without head count Yan Wang: This limitation  Manager, Yan Wang: So compared with the fourth method, it is another huge efficiency improvement. Yan Wang: Another interesting observation is that during the whole process, we spent all our energy on the most important things. Yan Wang: We never talked about how to write SQL. Yan Wang: We also didn’t talk about  I don’t think about how to make the video conversation more effective, but mostly about how to make my opinions more acceptable to the leaders, how to present them, and whether I have missed any important insights, etc. Yan Wang: Every  All the time was spent on the tour. Yan Wang: I see quite a few problems.  Let’s talk about a very important topic, which is how we can make sure that what he does is right, for example, whether the code he wrote is correct, whether the conclusion he drew is correct. This is a very good question. Yan Wang: If you go to our course, you will find that we spend a special page to talk about, Yan Wang: How to manage and cross check risk with AI? Yan Wang: Various results.  In fact, whether it is AI or humans, when you are a manager, you need to do this. You need to evaluate the quality of the work done by the team members, and whether their work is right or not is very important.  aspects of the quality of assessment. Yan Wang: Of course, in this process, you will gradually build trust with AI, or with human team members. You will know which people are reliable and which ones you need to be more careful about.  It’s a gradual adaptation.  when. Yan Wang: But I agree with this, it's a good one.  We must check each insight one by one. We must have a mechanism to check and cannot be completely blind. Yan Wang: Okay, the demo is almost done here. Yan Wang: Let's look back at the first to fifth methods. Yan Wang: If we compare the first with the fifth, we will find that the fifth is similar to the manual method, or even to the method of using  Compared with the previous method, it is really a revolutionary change. Yan Wang: Let’s gradually look at where our time is spent and what our core capabilities are from these aspects.  If you want to be promoted, what core abilities do you need and what your job level is? Yan Wang: In the manual stage, most of the time is spent switching between different apps, copying and pasting dataYan Wang: And, hey, I found that I made a mistake, I ran back to fix it, we want to improve our work  Quality, our core competence.  Yes, I must not make mistakes, I must be careful, I must be familiar with his syntax, familiar with the details of each data clerk, Yan Wang: This way of thinking is very elementary, Yan Wang: He didn’t even design it, you  Whether you can get a promotion or not has nothing to do with whether you can analyze or not, right? Yan Wang: But after we have charge gpt, it seems to make things a lot more convenient for us, right?  You don't need to be particularly familiar with the syntax of SQL, you just need to be familiar with the structure of the background table.  We don't need to be so careful because charge gpt helps us automate many steps, but most of our time is still spent on v ai work.  We need to collect information for AI, copy and paste codes and error messages back and forth between ChargeBT and SQL. Yan Wang: We also need the ability to build prompt words at a very low level.  Therefore, the corresponding skill is still that of a junior analyst, because most of our energy and time are not spent on real analysis, but on collecting and presenting data. Yan Wang: When we started using the agent, we gradually had new weapons, and everything started to change. This was because the agent helped us to open up a complete  From super query to visualization, he opened up the whole link, so we can finally spend more time on the really important data observation, interpretation, and analysis. Facing Yan Wang: Let us finally have the ability to focus on training senior  The core competencies required of analysts. Yan Wang: However, because the agent v1 is still an intermediate product and does not have the ability to make multiple decisions, our main focus is still on how to decompose the problem so that it can adapt to the agent. Yan Wang: Once the ai  The ability of AI has been expanded from single decision-making to multiple decision-making, which has greatly enhanced its potential and truly realized agent AI. Has it reached this point?  For example, when we use call desktop and mcp to do weekly business review, what we do has nothing to do with SQL. Yan Wang: Almost 100% of our time is spent on thinking, judging and reporting on data.  This greatly improves our work efficiency, allowing our core capabilities to no longer be limited by programming, but to focus on data analysis and reporting. Yan Wang: From this perspective, what we do is  Like a team leader, a tech lead, right? Yan Wang: We have people who are very good at writing code or AI, but the final technical decision and the final direction are still made by us humans. Yan Wang: If we expand the tools that AI can use and take it to the next level, the potential of these tools combined will be much greater than that of a single tool.  When we use tools such as cursor or win surf to add extended AI agent, it can perform very in-depth analysis completely autonomously. During the whole process, it can even search the Internet and compare it with local data.  Verify each other and make deductions, so what about in the middle of this process?  We actually only did two things. Yan Wang: The first thing was to define what the problem was, tell him what you were going to do, and what the standard was for completing the task successfully. Then he could  Think, execute, and iterate according to this standard. Yan Wang: The second thing is inspiration and management.  We need to judge the quality of his task.  How about it, let’s see if he made any mistakes?  Give him some guidance to see if he has missed any key points and teach him how to think about the whole problem. These are very similar to the management of people. Yan Wang: So, in this method, our workplace role is more like a manager rather than a simple analyst. We do not involve any technical how-to issues, but simply define and evaluate the issues.  Quality inspires us. Yan Wang: And it is different from human experience. Yan Wang: We don’t have the limit of head count. As long as you can manage it, you can open ten case windows and do different things at the same time.  , this is a truly scalable experience that is more powerful than human experience. Yan Wang: So now when we look back at the previous picture, do we have a deeper understanding?  Especially after watching the fifth demo and experiencing this kind of manager who completely delegates power, do you have a feeling like, “What the hell just happened?”  right. Yan Wang: Compared to the little person on the left who uses chat gpt or even manual methods, the person on the right will indeed be overwhelmingly competitive in the workplace. Yan Wang: An interesting thing is that if I show you the fifth method right away without comparing it to the previous method, it might not be very intuitive to understand. That’s why we start with the first method.  Let everyone feel the limitations of technology step by step. Yan Wang: Confucius once said that if you can't understand something, you can't understand it. First, you make the student feel very painful, and when he can't figure it out no matter how hard he tries, then tell him the solution. This is a means of effective learning. Wang: We also start from the most basic methods here, and gradually feel the limitations. We make mistakes together, and then correct them, summarize and sublimate them, and achieve the upgrade of thinking and cognition at a more abstract level. This is the real learning.  . Yan Wang: The goal of learning is not just to talk.  I know that among these five methods, the fifth is the best, but we should learn this method of learning.  By learning this way of thinking, you will know where mistakes may be made and how to solve them, thus improving your cognition from both positive and negative sides. Yan Wang: In addition, each of the methods mentioned above and related materials can be downloaded from this website.  And actually when we build this website, I just used the method I just used to talk to the cursor, and it wrote out the box. This is our prompt word. Yan Wang: And it can also accept image input. I put the previous  I took a screenshot of the form and showed it to him, and he made the website. Yan Wang: After comparing a series of different methods, a natural question is that now we have reached the fifth stage, Yan Wang: So what should we do next?  Where is our value?  Where is our way out? Yan Wang: I am not going to answer this question directly, because I think the answer to this question itself is not important. Yan Wang: The reason is, for example, at the end of 2024, we now have a very powerful thing called agent. Yan Wang: Then if  In mid-20225, another model will be released, for example, o one. The next generation may not be called o two, but o three.  Is that right?  That’s huge progress.  Yes, Yan Wang: Or another one I randomly named capsule ai, Yan Wang: Does that mean we have to abandon everything we learned about the agent before and learn something new? Yan Wang: So, instead of simply pursuing how to passively respond to agenda AI, you might as well take a step back and make some deeper preparations. Yan Wang: What the class representative and I have to do is to help everyone adapt to this as much as possible.  A dynamic change, for Yan Wang: adapt to the ever-evolving field of AI, and enable everyone to adapt independently from a methodological perspective, rather than running around, so that everyone has the ability to be among the headlines of various public accounts.  What is the real information? For example, agents like this, AI is the real innovation. Yan Wang: Or other things are just gimmicks, don't look at them. Yan Wang: Only in this way, can we really tie the fish to the trap and make everyone more  Achieve long-term success in the workplace. Yan Wang: So if we want to truly change ourselves over a longer period of time and adapt to this dynamically changing field of AI, or transform yourself for the age of AI, what should we do? Yan Wang: This involves a very interesting change. Yan Wang: Before the AI ​​era, what kind of people did companies need?  As we discussed earlier, he basically needs someone who is meticulous and willing to spend time on the work. Yan Wang: But if you look at our example just now, Yan Wang: you will find that if a person only knows these things, I am careful, I work hard, and nothing else, it has now been replaced by AI Yan Wang: computer calculation,  Never make a mistake.  Working overtime 24/7 is nothing, so the standards for people in future companies are different, especially for the fifth method mentioned above. The company needs people who can define problems and understand business.  and products, and translate them into precise and organized specific requirements. For Yan Wang: He needs someone who knows how to communicate with AI and can effectively lead AI and be a good boss of AI. Yan Wang: He needs someone who knows  How to decompose tasks, know the limits of AI capabilities, inspire and manage AI to do work, Yan Wang: Then in this way, Yan Wang: He recruits one person, which is actually equivalent to recruiting a scalable team, because now one person  Adding ten AIs can equal the team of ten people in the past. Yan Wang: However, it is not easy to achieve these.  We need to be trained. Yan Wang: In order to provide everyone with the most effective training class representatives, I spent a year gradually polishing an AI course. Yan Wang: We contacted more than 3,000 students from 20 countries and taught them  , listen to their feedback and understand what they care about most.  At the same time, we ourselves have profound engineering experience and know what are the most useful skills in the workplace? Yan Wang: During this year, we repeatedly iterated, refined, and experimented, and wrote an original textbook of 100 to 200 pages. Considering that many people would end up with nothing after buying the course, we put the most essential parts of it back into the textbook.  The most useful part is condensed into a five-session live class. For Yan Wang: You can interact with us live during the class via zoom live broadcast on Maven, or you can watch the video in the second link  way, learn at your own pace. Yan Wang: Our goal is not to help everyone understand the technical details behind AI, nor to make everyone familiar with a specific AI technology, including agent AI, but to really let everyone learn from the long-term historical methodology. Yan Wang: Because we have invested a huge amount of time and based on the value we provide to everyone, we have received a lot of praise. Our overall score is 4.9 out of 5.  , basically the highest level on Maven, Yan Wang: And the class representative and I are also a very rare pair of best Chinese lecturers, Yan Wang: At the same time, Yan Wang: It is also to thank everyone for their support.  At the end of this live broadcast, we will release a discount code.  For cool base courses taught by real people, we will reduce the price by $100.  We will discount $50 for self-paced courses with video learning. Yan Wang: Let's get back to the topic of training. Specifically, we need to train in four aspects, and these four aspects are actually reflected in this live broadcast. Yan Wang: The first aspect is AI.  The field is developing dynamically, so we need to be able to keep up with industry trends. Yan Wang: For example, now we know that there is something called devon which is very popular, right? Yan Wang: He, what is his use?  What kind of scene is it suitable for?  What is the difference between it and cursor? Why does Devin dare to sell it for $500 a month when cursor only costs $20? Yan Wang: What is Open webui? Yan Wang: If my company does not allow me to use commercial AI, is it possible for me to build an LM locally? Yan Wang: You can find the answers to these things through our training, and you don’t have to follow the official account.  Every day I am shocked by the sudden news that Musk likes, and then I find some seemingly plausible insights from it. Yan Wang: This is a very realistic example. Before listening to this live broadcast, most people may not know what MCP is, but after listening to it, they think MCP is really great, and they know that it is still not perfect, and there is more.  Good solution, Yan Wang: This is also a major advantage of our course. Let JP Morgan change researchers. Christine mentioned in his review that our course has greatly broadened his imagination of how to apply AI.  Li, Yan Wang: and Lou also mentioned in his review that this course gave him countless eye opening examples.  To Yan Wang: From a deeper perspective, this training and live broadcast can not only tell you that agent AI is possible, or you can use it this way, but also use it behind these applications.  There is often a more profound perspective, such as the five we just looked at, how to do them?  Business?  How have review methods evolved?  The comparison between them and their development context can give you a deeper understanding of the differences between them, so that when you encounter milestone technological advances like agent AI in the future, you can keenly capture this event.  The matter is very important. Yan Wang: In the process of our teaching, we are sometimes asked a question, saying, what is the difference between your course and me reading documents directly?  To Yan Wang: The five perspectives mentioned above are also ready-made examples. For example, if you talk about the interface on the cursor and what each button does, you should be able to understand it as long as you explore it or look at the help and documentation.  Right? Yan Wang: However, if you organically expand, combine and apply these functions, you will become a scalable manager. This profound perspective is a core value brought by this course. Yan Wang: But we haven’t finished talking about the cursor yet. In the next live broadcast, we will explain it in detail. If you just click its buttons and know how to use its UI, you will discover its potential.  Probably less than a third.  But if you are trained and know that there are three different mindsets, gaze-based programming, cue-based programming and goal-based programming, you will have a deeper understanding of how to maximize its potential under different circumstances.  What's more important is that when you encounter similar AI developments in the future, you will have a method to know how to explore its application from a more abstract and profound perspective. Yan Wang: And these can all be obtained through training.  This is because we have already spent time trying and thinking for you, so you don’t have to spend time exploring on your own, but can directly stand on the shoulders of others.  Yes, Yan Wang: This is reflected in many of our students’ feedback. For example, Google’s UX manager Cherry mentioned that although he is a user of AI tools, he can still learn from the courses and training.  Raise your cognition to a higher level. Yan Wang: Virgil from Meta Data Centers also mentioned that he really enjoyed the original thinking methods and application skills he learned from the guests. Yan Wang: In addition, through training, we can also know the facts and the reasons. We can not only know various practical skills, but also know the internal principles of RM. For example, there are some common misunderstandings about ARM.  To Yan Wang: Does it have memory?  Why do I feel bluer and dumber than others when using ChargeBT?  How do hallucinations occur and how do they relate to the temperature of inference?  Could adjusting the temperature of inference solve the problem?  What is the purpose of fine-tuning?  What are its limitations?  Should it be used in our specific scenario? These are all covered and introduced in our course materials. Yan Wang: Our students also have deep feelings about this.  For example, SLB's senior research and scientists all mentioned that during the course, we used a very easy-to-understand method to explain the various principles behind them.  Why Yan Wang: Finally, some students may ask me that I am not a programmer, so it will be difficult to serve your clients. In fact, it is not. If you do not have a lot of development experience or the project is not related to software development,  You can also get a lot of inspiration from the course.  This is partly because the content of our courses is more about abstract, high-level principles, rather than just domain knowledge in the field of software development.  What about the other side?  After you ask your actual questions and scenarios, we will give you very detailed answers based on your specific scenarios. Yan Wang: For example, our students are not only from the software development industry, but also university professors, finance, medicine, IT, students from various fields around the world, and even AI experts working in OpenAI or AWS. Yan Wang  : All kinds of students will be inspired here.  For example, as the reviewer An An said, he felt that the most valuable aspect of this course was the handy and instant feedback the teacher provided to students. Yan Wang: Similarly, Xin also felt that we provided very detailed answers to his specific questions. Yan Wang: And for some students who are not even in the type industry, such as Max, he also feels very rewarding. Yan Wang: Theory alone is not enough. We will also teach you step by step using the projects you are interested in.  Teaching, how to develop good habits, and more importantly, to cultivate a builder mindset that does not succumb to the status quo and uses AI to build tools to encourage breaking the status quo Yan Wang: Our student Lin Bo mentioned that after taking our  After the course, he not only learned a lot of theoretical and technical knowledge, but more importantly, his fundamental attitude towards AI changed, encouraging him to use more experiments and innovations to explore how to use AI in his work. Yan Wang: So  In fact, if you can only remember one thing after watching this live broadcast, I hope you remember it is the builders mindset.  As for the weekly business review we just talked about.  The specific examples are not important. The five comparisons we made, agent, and AI are not important. The most important thing is that we must have the courage to explore and experiment with the builders mindset. As long as you have this mindset, you can Yan Wang: I can discover all these thoughts by myself. Yan Wang: And what is it called?  When you are not satisfied with the tools you use, don’t think that you don’t have the ability to change the status quo. This may have been a difficult thing in the past. People would say, “I have not received professional training, I am not from a professional background, and I can’t do it in CS.” But now  You saw it too.  With AI, especially agent AI, as long as you give it direction, you can define the problem with it, and it will help you solve it. This kind of thing is completely possible. Yan Wang: Especially in this era,  For most people, AI is still a very new and even distant thing.  Therefore, everyone who comes to participate in this live broadcast already has a huge advantage. Now is like the early days of the gold rush, with several times the productivity and opportunities for improvement everywhere, so you might as well apply and find opportunities to significantly improve your own or others' productivity.  On the one hand, this is beneficial to the entire society and to mankind. On the other hand, after creating value, you will naturally get career or financial rewards. Yan Wang: Finally, thank you all very much for participating in this live broadcast. We offer a discount code for this course.  Agent 2 zero twenty five. Yan Wang: If you take the Maven Cohort Base course, the original price is $999 and you can get a $100 discount. If you take the Self-Paced course, the original price is $499, you can decode $50. Yan Wang: We are often asked a question, which is why your course is so expensive?  After all, not everyone can afford $1000 or $500 for a class, but I would like to ask, Yan Wang: Do you think what you learned from this free live broadcast today is worth $500, or what will you learn in the future?  During your career, the value he created for you, the time he saved and the improved work quality are worth $500. Yan Wang: So if we compare the value of what we gain with the cost, we will find that $500 is a very small number. Yan Wang: And I can also tell you with confidence that in the nearly 200 pages of  Yan Wang: The insights and skills in the course materials and five hours of live broadcast or recording are three to five times more valuable than the agent's AI.  This course is actually very cheap. Yan Wang: What’s one more thing?  Many companies will reimburse for this type of self-improvement courses. We can provide professional email templates to managers and certificates of completion. Yan Wang: And our courses are constantly being updated.  For example, in recent months, we have made three major updates to the course materials and layout, adding dozens of pages of new materials. All previous students can use them for free, so we also plan to increase the price of this course in the near future.  The discount code for agent2025 will expire at midnight on December 23rd, Pacific Time, two days later. Yan Wang: So I hope that interested students can seize these opportunities to further develop in the rapidly changing AI era.  Widen the gap between yourself and classmates who don’t have AI and make yourself more competitive.  Yes, Yan Wang: Thank you everyone, I can answer some questions now, Yan Wang: Maybe we can take a look, first look at the check window. Yan Wang: Does Curl compost require an agent that you define yourself?  It is not defined by myself, this is a function of the new version. Yan Wang: Is the agent related to the search engine called later? Yes, it is related. Yan Wang: It calls a search engine tool extended by ourselves.  Crystal itself does not have this tool. I implemented this using python. Yan Wang: How did you implement it specifically?  On our course website, not the course website, there is also an introduction on the agent2025 website that I just posted. Yan Wang: up Yan Wang: Which company is cursor from? Annie Speer Yan Wang: Are there any AI events for algorithm engineers? Yan Wang:  I think AI practice is not very different for various professions. Yan Wang: If you can master some high-level, abstract thinking methods.  As for Mindset, Yan Wang: I will discover a lot of domain knowledge for different professions.  Of course, if you have practical scenario problems, you are also welcome to discuss them in the community. We will discuss and answer them in great detail. Yan Wang: Will these questions be answered somewhere? Yan Wang: Yes. Yan Wang: We will answer in the community Yan Wang: There will be a replay Yan Wang: It seems that the following technical background will find the course simple to Yuzhen has already answered very well, Yan Wang: Okay Yan Wang: I really want to  Let's explore rag Yan Wang: I want to keep a Yan Wang: leave a button.  We actually spent a whole lesson in the course to explain why we don’t say rack? Yan Wang: Maybe we can keep it in the course or it’s good, and we’ve already seen it. Yan Wang: Okay, let’s take a look at the question on slider. Do you have any suggestions for accumulating project experience when looking for an AI job? Yan Wang: I have two biggest suggestions. The first and biggest suggestion is to build my side.  Really do it Yan Wang: Before you decide on a paper, you must know that you must practice it and do it yourself. Yan Wang: You have really done some projects, even if they are very small ones.  After you have your own experience, the level of your resume will be very different from others. Yan Wang: This can be seen in the harmonious, whether it is an interview or a resume, you can see your  Depth of thinking, this may be the most important thing. Yan Wang: Second, when looking for an AI job , you may need to figure out your position in the ecosystem.  Generally speaking, there are three types of AI, with different positions. Yan Wang: The most upstream is to do algorithms, for example, I train LM, and the midstream is to do serving. I have a ready-made LM, and others have trained it for me.  , how to serve it economically, efficiently and quickly Yan Wang: What’s next?  It is to use the API served by others to make specific applications. Each position has different requirements. Yan Wang: If you have some specific examples that are more relevant to you, you can also use us.  Ask questions in the community and we will give you detailed answers Yan Wang: How did you do search engel?  Let me post a link here. Yan Wang: Yagedaoai is my blog. If you are interested in this, you can subscribe here. Yan Wang: Let’s get back to the topic.  Here is a blog that teaches you how to Yan Wang: Define all identity authentications. I will send the link to zoomchat. Yan Wang: Including our Yan Wang: agent2025 webpage also has this link. Yan Wang: Can this be achieved with Vs code and copilot?  So far it has not been realized because vsvs code plus copilot currently does not have an agent mode. Yan Wang: But it can be realized.  I guess, if github coil Yan Wang: To surpass this function, or catch up with this function, it should be very fast Yan Wang: You may wish to wait and see Yan Wang: The accuracy of the information Yan Wang: Yes, this is a very good question.  To Yan Wang: We must ensure the accuracy of the information.  I think the most important thing is to realize that this person is idle and has a lot of time to spare. This is the most crucial thing. Yan Wang: The second key is to have enough mechanism. Yan Wang: For example, when you are doing this, you can make a checklist and add a line at the appropriate time. Wang: Ensure the accuracy of the data. Yan Wang: This way you won’t forget to put it into the mechanism. Putting it into the sop is the most reliable. Yan Wang: There is a co pilot that is not connected to the database.  To Yan Wang: The solution is to write an agent yourself. Yan Wang: We just showed you how to write an agent. It’s very simple. You talk to Chris in natural language, ask him to write a Python script, and then use natural language to tell Chris rules. Just use the tools as you like. Yan Wang: There are too many tools on the market. Can you briefly introduce which tools are easy to use? Yan Wang: Yes, I actually spent a lot of time researching the market. Yan Wang: What tools are there? I tried all of them, including the 200 yuan pro for one month and the 500 yuan davin for one month. Yan Wang:  I hope that everyone can give you some inspiration. Here I will post another article for you. Yan Wang: I think the best one is cursor. I also hope that they can give me some money. Yan Wang: Yes, Yan Wang: It  It is not only a tool for writing code, but also a tool that I think has the potential to replace ChargeBT and Cloud. For example, when you chat with it, Yan Wang: You can ask it to translate, and the interface is very good, with Chinese and English. Yan Wang: You can make it rag, for example, if I put my blog in the cursor, and then directly press command and enter, Yan Wang: it can read my blog and do rug, Yan Wang: then  To sum up, the author's views on gpt and the changes over time are our questions. Yan Wang: Very well and deeply explained. Yan Wang: Then, he can do searches, like we just did.  I asked him, any news from the Irvings?  He would directly say that he had a shipments campaign launched in December and released it continuously for that whole December, and he released the O One model. I then asked him, didn’t Ou Wan release it a long time ago?  He did further search and said, you are right, the one released on September 12th is the preview of the December release?  It is the full version, and what is the difference between the full version? So you see this function, it is actually better than I think Yan Wang: OK Yan Wang: Let's take a look at other issues Yan Wang: Visualization ml, html is not  To facilitate sharing with colleagues, you can directly tell them, Yan Wang: You can literally tell the cursor, can you also put my query into the departmental results? Yan Wang: Okay, can we feed the query to the model and score the query? Yan Wang: This is a very good question. I haven’t tried it, but I think you can just speak to the model in natural language.  The most difficult problem here is probably to score the query. You need to give it a very clear standard, what kind of query is good and what kind is bad, and it is best to give it some examples. Yan Wang:  Only in this way can it complete its task effectively. Yan Wang: When we ask the model to complete a task, we need to think in reverse and find out what information it needs to complete the task and provide it with all this information. Yan Wang: Are there any comparison markers and cursors? Yan Wang: I haven't seen the big one released by Github yet. This is good information. Yan Wang: I only know that they released a free version of copilot, but I can take a look and see if I can use it . Yan Wang:  Can there be an agent function? Yan Wang: Does Crystally runtime correspond to the virtual environment of the project?  Ah, this is a good question. Why did he adjust my version environment? It was because I told him in Crystal, Yan Wang: You have a python, vmv, npy, three,  ten.  This is the reason.  I told him, Yan Wang: Then Yan Wang: Will self pace customers have questions answered?  Yes Yan Wang: Just community access.  You can post some questions in the community, and we will give detailed answers. Yan Wang: If I don't know python struggle with this class, you need to understand the relevant information of python. Yan Wang: For example, how to read an emission  You don't need to know how to write a program, because AI will write it for you. Yan Wang: You need to know how to read and run it. If you are given a photo-taking program, you need to know how to run it and Yan Wang: eli, ah, Yan Wang: These libraries are the basic concepts. I believe you can get started in half an hour, especially now that we have agents. You see, the program just crashed, and you don’t need to do anything.  If any program crashes, he will analyze and modify the analysis script himself, so the requirement for Python is actually getting lower and lower. Yan Wang: When you are on the Internet, are you self-paced except for live sessions?  Yes, we have two two-hour live sessions and one and a half hour office hour.  Sidick, Yan Wang: The rest of the time is self-faced, because we also feel that on the one hand, people often suffer losses when buying courses, and saving people's time is actually better. In order to allow everyone to use this resource, we gave a condensed version  .  What about the other side?  There is really too much content.  If you teach a 200-page textbook seriously, it might take about a semester like a course in college. Yan Wang: What if you join a rug group or a group like that?  I would suggest asking in the community for details, because it involves your personal interests, scenarios, and situations. Yan Wang: It is stored locally, and all the documents are complete. Yan Wang: It can be found on the software.  Do calculations?  Yes, it should be possible if it has a full API.  If it doesn't have a complete API but has a GUI, there is another possibility.  Cloud has a thing Yan Wang: called cloud committer use, which is very cool. It allows you to let the cloud see your screen, Yan Wang: and then it can manipulate the mouse and keyboard to manipulate your app.  So if you don't have an API, this may be a last rescue, but it doesn't work very stably. Yan Wang: Okay, today's Yan Wang: We also exceeded the time limit by 16 minutes. I'm so sorry. It's almost time.  That’s it. We don’t seem to have any other questions now. What’s next?  We will send these courses and our website Yan Wang: to everyone. YZ Sun: There is a question that many people ask, which is what is the difference between cohort and southpace?  Then the difference is basically in teaching methods, but as for the content, we try to keep it consistent.  This cohort has live sessions, real-time Q&A, and office hours, and because everyone learns together, there is a rhythm.  Therefore, we generally find that students will study more seriously. YZ Sun: We will first talk about some new things in the cohort, and then form them into a more fixed document and update them together. For example, open source has been discussed in the forum, but it has not been discussed in the southpace forum.  If so, we may have to wait until the end of January or mid-February next year to release it. YZ Sun: Then another question is, if there is a possibility, you can sign up now, because we sign up for self-paced, because we hope to gather everyone in one place.  The problem is that it has been reported now, right?  You can directly see it. YZ Sun: We did not open this function because we are very lenient in terms of returns and refunds. So, as long as you are not satisfied, you can get a refund without any reason. In this case, if you buy a cohort,  We will send you the self-paste directly, and then you can directly refund it. It is more troublesome to operate. However, if you have reported a cohort and do not intend to refund, you can YZ Sun: discuss it with us, and then send it to us.  , we can help you arrange it, that's all, now make the self pace look right, YZ Sun: These two are not important. Yan Wang: I saw two or three other questions. Finally, let me answer the problem that the QR code does not show the discount. If the QR code does not show the discount, you need to manually enter the discount code agent2025. Yan Wang: This is for everyone. Yan Wang: A thank you.  The second question is how to acquire customers?  If you come late, you can shoot two of them.  The third question is the fifth method. How does the cursor connect to the local database? It is connected here. We told him in the prompt that I have a database. Its file name is this. It's that simple. I didn't do it.  Anything.  The following are all figures drawn by Crystal himself. Yan Wang: Okay, that's all for now. If you have more questions, please feel free to discuss further in the Yan Wang: super linear academy community.  All the information mentioned here will be sent to everyone. Hello, Yan Wang: Thank you very much for your participation. See you next time. There will be another live broadcast next week. Yan Wang: You can come and play again. Yan Wang: Bye. YZ Sun: Yeah.
