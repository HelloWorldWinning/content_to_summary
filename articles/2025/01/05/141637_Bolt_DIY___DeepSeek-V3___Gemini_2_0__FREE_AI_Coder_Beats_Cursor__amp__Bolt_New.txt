Content:
this new bolt DIY update is absolutely insane you can actually now integrate it directly with deep seek version 3 and I'm going to be showing you exactly how to use it plus how you can get access to it using Gemini free API with the brand new 2.0 update this is absolutely wild it's a free AI coder plus you can host it locally as you can see right here I'm going to be showing you the best ways to use it so make sure you keep watching and I'm going to be giving away all the best prompts tips SBS Etc so let's get straight into it now you want to get access to this it's available for free via GitHub so you can see the directory right here I'll include the links inside the video notes at the end of this video so make sure you keep watching and what you can see right here is that this has so many different additions to it as a free AI coding tool versus say using Bol or using cursor so it's very customized this allows you to input multiple llms which means that you can Leverage The Power of tools like for example deep seek version 3 which has just come out and is extremely powerful for building apps websites tools Etc now also what you can see right here if we go back to bolt is there's no limit on tokens you can host it locally it's completely free Additionally you can add in an API you can also get access to all of these different apis right here including black and also you can use a free version of Deep seeks hyperbolic API so just to be very clear here the hyperbolic team have actually allowed everyone to have free access to the deep seek API via their platform also you can switch to Google over here and then you can select for example Gemini experimental 1206 or Gemini 2.0 flash we can then go over to Google AI studio and inside Google's AI Studio you can grab a free API key just click right there and you can grab that for free no problemo so if you're wondering okay howy Host this it's pretty simple so first thing you want to make sure you have is Docker so make sure you have Docker installed it's completely free you can just have it running in the background then you're going to go to Temp make sure you've mpm installed and I'll show you exactly how to set this up so it's pretty simple stuff you don't need to be a coder you don't need to be tentacle at all here's how it goes step by steps first thing you want to do is go to terminal over here paste in the instructions like you can see and then finally pmpm runev right very simple just copy and paste those instructions if you get stuck screenshot it with your favorite AI tool and it will show you exactly what to fix along the way and then once you've got the Local Host URL like you can see right here which you can grab from the terminal so you can see it gives you a local host URL you can open that up in your browser like you can see right here and then now you've got access to B one thing that happened for me is when I first opened this up I had to refresh the page so I had to click refresh to actually get all of the AI models to load so that's just something to be wary of and then once you're inside here you can for example select DC chat over here and then just add in your API key right the other thing you can do is scroll to Google Gemini and like I was talking about before you can actually get a free API key like so if we select create API key I'll delete the API key after the video but now we have access to it so we can plug that into the API key section over here if we type something totally random like create a dad jok's keyboard we can now start building the app right and this basically allows anyone who doesn't have code and experience or access to build these tools out yourself and now we have our application ready to go like you can see right so it's coded out it's built all the files we literally just give it one very simple prompt and literally in seconds it create the whole website boom shaka let's click on the key check it works yes it does just's check through all of them yeah works perfectly fine in one single click right so powerful and it's not cost you anything right because running this version of Bol is completely free getting the API key from for example like AI Google studio is completely free and building out the website and testing it it's completely free pretty amazing if you ask me normally for example if you're using these tools online like b. new or for example lovable you're paying this is free for example cursor as well you have to pay as well and cursor is a bit more Technical and requires a bit more back and forth whereas it's completely free to use so that was just a little experiment now let's start getting into the interesting stuff I'm actually going to switch now to deep seek because everyone's talking about it right now now if you want to get access to the API just go to Deep seek.com then you can go to platform. dc.com and then from here you can grab an API key and this is really cheap I think I read somewhere it was like maybe a 10th of the price of claw 3.5 Sonic and those other tools but it's the newest version and super cheap and easy to use as well so we're just going to plug in API key right here so you can just click on the pen edit it and it's pretty simple and then for example we can say create an affiliate SEO blog about birds my name is Julian Goldy Amazon affiliate ID is this main this set to your website about bird watching build out a Blog as well there we go we'll send that as so what you can also see here is if we select this prompt and then click on the AI you can actually enhance the prompt right so you can make it a lot more in depth in details which means that when B actually goes to create the website and the project it's going to be way more detailed and therefore you'll get a better output what you can also see right here is you can select video you can ALS select the microphone you can also attach screenshots and you can select between which and it's pretty simple and easy the other cool thing you can do here as well is you can clone a git repo so there are some websites on GitHub that you can clone and you can import them directly into your project right here so absolutely amazing what you can do and basically your only limit here is creativity you can also download the code so if you download the code you can host that offline you can sync the files you can also push this to GitHub so you can actually publish your projects straight to GitHub and yeah it's really powerful stuff so now you may see that sometimes you get a preview error so you can ask both to fix it it and then it will start fixing the error and it will install any of the dependencies that you need and it is lightening fast as well right so when you're using the Deep C kpi seems really quick and easy to build stuff out now if we go to the preview we've got the blog ready to go if you're not happy with something you can just go back and prompt it inside the chat and then change the whole project and there you go you just buil out an N website in the space of two seconds boom shaka laka right we're not playing games today now you might be like okay that's great for you Julian Goldie but how you actually host it that's one of the questions I get asked a lot so let me show you exactly how you can host this if we go back to the code we'll download the code so we'll open the zip we'll open that up that's going to unzip the file we'll go to add a new site import an inis project inside netlify.com then we're going to go to netlify drop we'll drag that folder we just created we're going to upload that bad boy now an easy way to deploy this if you just go to push to GitHub in the top you can enter the name of your project and then you going enter in your gith username like you can see then you would add in your personal access token if you want to get your personal access token from GitHub again this is free then just go to developer settings inside your settings you'll see a drop down here for it and then you can just create one directly here just generate a new token and follow the instructions so if we go back to bolt we'll push this to get and then if you grab whatever repository you've built you can go to link repository inside netlify get link whichever one you want to link in so for examp example like you can see right here we'll hit deploy and that'll deploy from GitHub directly it might take a while to deploy as you can see right here but that's basically how you can do it step by step so let's test out another example right here we're going to create an SEO calculator website so loads more examples but here's another one that we'll try now which is creating an SEO cost calculator website you can see we've inserted the keyword right there we've also said link to this page add some brand colors add some content on the website so if we copy this prompt you get access to all the prompts Link in the com description in my free SEO course we can just build out this website right there's loads of different ways you can use these free AI coders for SEO right it doesn't have to be a calculat website it can be a local directory it could be an EMD it could be a landing page it could be a tool that you're building internally or one that you're trying to rank for you can even create Niche sites if you wanted to as well although usually when you're using this process that's going to take a bit more time if it's a big website the only issue that I would say with deep seek is if you're using the API key I don't think it has Vision so you probably want to use Gemini for that right Gemini 2.0 is probably better for using that process because for example if you want to screenshot any errors so you go over here and plug them in here you want to change the API now you can actually change the API key halfway through so you don't have to like go between chats you don't have to go between different projects you can just select the project that you want to change and from there fix it right so for example in this situation if we take a screenshot of this error that we're getting we'll plug that in in there and it's not going to work right and that's because deep seek doesn't have Vision access but if we grab the API key from Gemini then we're going to select Google Gemini 2.0 flash we'll plug in the API key we'll grab that screenshot again we'll go back to Gemini now and we'll say troubleshoot and then Gemini can actually use its vision and its multimodal model to actually fix this the other cool thing about this as well and then you can just ask Bol right and it will just come up with a way to fix it like that the other thing you can do will test this in a second is you got the voice mode right there so you can actually prompt it with voice instead but now you can see the SEO calculator website is ready to go now for example if we go back to the voice and we'll have to allow the microphone and so you can see now it's typ in based on what I'm saying through the microphone right which just makes it easy like you don't even need to use your fingers now you don't need to use your Brinks you got the AI to do that for you and you're kind of left wondering okay what are we doing here now obviously I don't have a lot of time inside this video to show you how you can go back and forth with these websites but if you want to see some examples of websites that we've created you can see this one page Lander right here this one was built with bolt as well like you see right here it's got loads of different pages across this local Rank and Rand website and additionally you can see an Enterprise SE calculator page that's ranking number one for its Target keyword as well so there's loads of different websites you can build with this here's an example and let's move on to the next one so what we're going to do now is try and build an agency website so let's let's grab this promp so this time we're just going to start a new chat just to keep things simple we use the same API so we'll use Gemini 2.0 Flash and the the one thing I love about this is just the speed of it saves you so much time in the time that it would take you to actually put up a job ad for a coder you've already built the website mate like you don't even need to worry about it anymore let alone the thousands of dollars that you would normally pay for that there many more actually inside this document including how I built 53 AR tools there's a full SCP on that with 10 different prompts Som how to do that right here you can also build like exact match domains like you can see local SEO websites here's another website we actually built out advertis in our service for video SEO ranking and yeah it's just so easy to do you might be saying okay why would you do this instead of using the normal sort of coding tools like bold. new or cursor or wind surf ETC number one this is free number two you can host it locally number three you can get access to deep seek and you can also use the free version of Gemini it also has perplexity built ins there it's very easy to install like I showed you on the terminal you can Import and Export the chats and it comes with speech recognition so yeah pretty powerful stuff and these websites you can build out are super nice right like you can see this one right here it's nice it's fast to use it's got really good core web vitals you can link it to a GitHub repository as well and that way when you're building this out they get updated as you update the local project yeah pretty amazing stuff like you can see with all of these websites that were built out and I would definitely recommend checking that out now if you want to get access to all the video notes from today prompts as well as all my best prompts for example like bolt cursor Wier lovable Etc all these free AI coders I've actually tested
