Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Challenges in Wind Speed Forecasting:**
    *   Wind speed is inherently intermittent, making it difficult to predict accurately.
    *   Wind speed time series (TS) exhibit nonlinear and nonstationary behavior.
    *   Wind speed data is not normally distributed, complicating prediction with standard methods.

2.  **Decomposition Techniques:**
    *   Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is used to break down complex time series into simpler components.
    *   Improved versions of EMD, including Ensemble EMD (EEMD), Complementary EEMD (CEEMD), and Complete EEMD with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) are utilized for better decomposition.

3.  **Hybrid Forecasting Methods:**
    *   EMD and its improved versions are combined with Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) predictors.
    *   These hybrid EMD-based forecasting methods are evaluated on 12 wind speed time series.

4.  **Performance Evaluation and Results:**
    *   EMD and its improved versions significantly boost SVR performance.
    *   The impact on ANN performance is marginal.
    *   CEEMDAN-SVR achieves the best overall performance among the tested hybrid methods.

5.  **Future Work:**
    *   The paper suggests directions for further research in wind speed forecasting.

**Core Point:**
Hybridizing CEEMDAN with SVR is the most effective method among the tested techniques for improving wind speed forecasting accuracy.

**Fundamental Point:**
Decomposing the complex, non-linear wind speed time series into simpler components through improved EMD techniques enhances the performance of machine learning models for forecasting.

**Overarching Framework:**
The paper focuses on improving wind speed forecasting by employing a combination of time series decomposition techniques (EMD and its variants) with computational intelligence methods (SVR and ANN), concluding that CEEMDAN-SVR is a superior approach.

Content:
Wind speed forecasting is challenging due to its intermittent nature. The wind speed time series (TS) has nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics and not normally distributed, which make it difficult to be predicted by statistical or computational intelligent methods. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and its improved versions are powerful tools to decompose a complex TS into a collection of simpler ones. The improved versions discussed in this paper include ensemble EMD (EEMD), complementary EEMD (CEEMD), and complete EEMD with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). The EMD and its improved versions are hybridized with two computational intelligence-based predictors: support vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural network (ANN). The EMD-based hybrid forecasting methods are evaluated with 12 wind speed TS. The performances of the hybrid methods are compared and discussed. It shows that EMD and its improved versions enhance the performance of SVR significantly but marginally on ANN, and among the EMD-based hybrid methods, the proposed CEEMDAN-SVR is the best method. Possible future works are also recommended for wind speed forecasting.
