Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **The Issue with OE Models:**
    *   Initial user experiences with OE (likely referring to a specific large language model) were often negative, with responses deemed contradictory and lacking in depth.
    *   This led to user frustration and questions about the model's utility.

2.  **The Key to Effective Interaction with OE:**
    *   **Context is Crucial:** Unlike typical conversational models that gather context from interactions, OE models accept initial user prompts as the sole basis for responses.
    *   **Detailed Prompts Required:** Users must provide ample context, explicit instructions, and desired outcomes when prompting OE.
    *   **Avoiding Ambiguity:** Clearly define your needs instead of expecting OE to infer your intentions.
    *   **OE as a Reasoning Engine:** OE should be viewed as a problem-solving tool that can plan and execute steps to achieve goals. Do not think of it like other chat models that are designed to follow direct instructions.

3.  **The Shift in Mindset:**
    *   Instead of just providing prompts, users should approach OE with a "BREATH" mindset – giving it materials and instructions for it to do the reasoning and problem-solving on its own.
    *   OE is more of a strategic "designer" of solutions than a simple chatbot.

4. **Call to action**
     *   Encourages users to fully explore and experiment with the full range of OE's capabilities.

**Core Point:** OE models, unlike traditional chat models, require detailed contextual prompts and explicit instructions to deliver high-quality responses because they focus on reasoning and problem solving.

**Fundamental Point:** Effective use of OE models hinges on understanding their reasoning-oriented architecture, thus shifting from a conversational approach to a more strategic and comprehensive prompting strategy.

**Overarching Framework:**

The content presents a problem (poor initial experiences with an AI model) and then provides a solution (a new interaction strategy based on understanding the model's architecture), with a call to action to encourage users to fully explore the model's capabilities.
