Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **肌疯 (Ji Feng) Definition:**
    *   肌疯 refers to seeing external images (or "signs") related to events, whether in the surrounding environment, during dreams, or at the very moment an event is happening.
    *   These images can be triggered by various situations, including client interactions or even simple inquiries.

2.  **Examples of 肌疯:**
    *   A person asking about investing in mainland China, while someone nearby carries a chicken (肌) and returns with one they bought.
    *   Seeing various animal images: chicken, fish, goose (where the goose's "head pain" indicates it will be used), pig, cow, sheep (all associated with "prickly, irritating blood") or a dog (causing a person to flee).
    *   During a conversation about business and a friend's fortune, noticing someone eating pork chops.
3.  **Ubiquity of 肌疯:**
    *   肌疯 is pervasive, existing at all times, and preceding events. These pre-event images (signs) are considered a type of "独图" (unique image).

4.  **Core Point:** 肌疯 is the perception of symbolic imagery surrounding events, acting as a form of "獨圖" (unique image) that foreshadows or accompanies circumstances.

5.  **Fundamental Point:** Pre-event sensory data, even seemingly insignificant, can be interpreted as significant symbolic indicators related to current or future occurrences.

6.  **Overarching Framework:** The framework posits that seemingly random, external images, including animal imagery and seemingly unrelated occurrences, act as signs related to ongoing events and their underlying dynamics.
