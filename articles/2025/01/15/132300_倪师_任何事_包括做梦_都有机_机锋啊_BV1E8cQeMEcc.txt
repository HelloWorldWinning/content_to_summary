Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Concept of "Ji Feng" (肌疯):**
    *   Ji Feng refers to external images or occurrences that we perceive, whether in our waking life or in dreams.
    *   These images can be anything, from a customer arriving to someone carrying a chicken.
    *   They are not isolated events but part of a system of meaning.

2.  **Examples of Ji Feng:**
    *   A customer coming to ask for business is a Ji Feng.
    *   Someone asking about investment while a person carrying a chicken walks by is a Ji Feng.
    *   Seeing animals (chicken, fish, goose, dog, pig, cow, sheep) can also be Ji Feng.
    *   Even someone eating pork while discussing business can be a Ji Feng.

3.  **Animal Symbolism:**
    *   Animals like chickens, fish, and geese might require more effort or cause pain (e.g., killing a goose).
    *   Other animals like dogs, pigs, and cows represent situations where one quickly moves away or avoids (刺织急血).

4.  **Relationship to Actions:**
    *   Ji Feng acts as a premonition or sign, influencing one's decision.
    *   For example, if someone is planning something and there is a strong "Ji Feng" that seems to be a negative omen, they will likely change their plans.

**Core Point:** Ji Feng is the concept of external phenomena acting as signs that provide context and meaning before or during an event.

**Fundamental Point:** These seemingly random external images or events ("Ji Feng") are interpreted as relevant signals, shaping how individuals understand and respond to situations.

**Overarching Framework:** The content presents a framework where everyday occurrences are not just random events but are seen as interconnected, meaningful "signs" ("Ji Feng") that guide decision-making and understanding of a situation, like a unique form of divination that uses visual and situational input as guidance.
