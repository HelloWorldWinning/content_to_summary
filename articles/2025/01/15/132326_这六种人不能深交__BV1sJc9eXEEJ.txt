    *   **Rhythm:** The pattern of sounds and silences in time.
    *   **Melody:** A sequence of single notes that are musically satisfying.
    *   **Harmony:** The combination of multiple notes played simultaneously.
    *   **Timbre:** The unique quality of a sound, often called tone color.
    *   **Form/Structure:** The overall organization of a musical piece.
    *   **Expression:** Music communicates emotions and ideas.

2.  **Functions of Music:**
    *   **Entertainment:**  A source of enjoyment and pleasure.
    *   **Emotional Expression:** A way to express and evoke feelings.
    *   **Cultural Significance:** Reflects and shapes cultural values and practices.
    *   **Social Connection:** Facilitates social bonding and shared experiences.
    *   **Communication:** Transmits messages and stories.

3. **Diversity:**
