Content:
This paper introduces AlphaVision, an innovative decision support model designed for stock price prediction by seamlessly integrating real-time news updates and Return on Investment (ROI) values, utilizing various machine learning and deep learning approaches. The research investigates the application of these techniques to enhance the effectiveness of stock trading and investment decisions by accurately anticipating stock prices and providing valuable insights to investors and businesses. The study begins by analyzing the complexities and challenges of stock market analysis, considering factors like political, macroeconomic, and legal issues that contribute to market volatility. To address these challenges, we proposed the methodology called AlphaVision, which incorporates various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Na茂ve Bayes, Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine, alongside deep learning models such as Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Artificial Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks. The effectiveness of each model is evaluated based on their accuracy in
