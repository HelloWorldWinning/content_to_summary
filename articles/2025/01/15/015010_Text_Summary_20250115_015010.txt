Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Research Goal:**
    *   Develop a novel neural network approach for enhanced stock market prediction.
2.  **Data & Context:**
    *   Utilizes live stock market data for real-time and offline analysis.
    *   Employs visualizations and analytics.
    *   Demonstrates Internet of Multimedia of Things (IMMT) application for stock analysis.
3.  **Problem Addressed:**
    *   Traditional neural networks often fail due to random initial weight selection, leading to inaccurate predictions.
4.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Introduces the concept of "stock vectors," inspired by word vector embeddings in deep learning.
    *   Inputs multi-stock, high-dimensional historical data, not just single indices.
    *   Proposes two models:
        *   Deep LSTM with an embedded layer.
        *   LSTM with an autoencoder.
5.  **Methodology:**
    *   Both models use the embedded layer and autoencoder respectively to vectorize input data.
    *   The vectorized data are then fed into a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for stock prediction.
6.  **Results:**
    *   Deep LSTM with embedded layer performed slightly better.
    *   Shanghai A-shares composite index: 57.2% accuracy vs 56.9%.
    *   Individual stocks: 52.4% accuracy vs 52.5%.
7.  **Contribution:**
    *   Demonstrates research contributions in IMMT for neural network-based financial analysis.

**Core Point:** This research introduces a novel approach for stock market prediction by using "stock vectors" derived from historical multi-stock data, and implementing deep learning models with embedded layers and autoencoders within LSTM networks.

**Fundamental Point:** Utilizing embedded layers within LSTM networks, this work advances the application of deep learning techniques to financial analysis, achieving more accurate stock predictions.

**Overarching Framework:** The paper follows a standard research framework including: problem definition, solution proposal, model implementation, experimental evaluation and conclusion.

Content:
This paper aims to develop an innovative neural network approach to achieve better stock market predictions. Data were obtained from the live stock market for real-time and off-line analysis and results of visualizations and analytics to demonstrate Internet of Multimedia of Things for stock analysis. To study the influence of market characteristics on stock prices, traditional neural network algorithms may incorrectly predict the stock market, since the initial weight of the random selection problem can be easily prone to incorrect predictions. Based on the development of word vector in deep learning, we demonstrate the concept of "stock vector." The input is no longer a single index or single stock index, but multi-stock high-dimensional historical data. We propose the deep long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) with embedded layer and the long short-term memory neural network with automatic encoder to predict the stock market. In these two models, we use the embedded layer and the automatic encoder, respectively, to vectorize the data, in a bid to forecast the stock via long short-term memory neural network. The experimental results show that the deep LSTM with embedded layer is better. Specifically, the accuracy of two models is 57.2 and 56.9%, respectively, for the Shanghai A-shares composite index. Furthermore, they are 52.4 and 52.5%, respectively, for individual stocks. We demonstrate research contributions in IMMT for neural network-based financial analysis.
