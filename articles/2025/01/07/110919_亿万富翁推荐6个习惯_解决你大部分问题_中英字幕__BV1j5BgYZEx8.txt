**Summary:**

1.  **Keystone Habits for a Virtuous Life:**
    *   The core idea is that creating keystone habits can significantly impact all aspects of life, leading to a virtuous and successful life.
    *   Keystone habits are high-impact actions that create positive ripple effects.

2.  **Key Keystone Habits:**
    *   **Taking Action:**
        *   Prioritize action over overthinking.
        *   Be proactive and pursue opportunities.
    *   **Learning from "Failure":**
        *   View "failures" as learning opportunities.
        *   Embrace a growth mindset; action is 50/50, so focus on learning if "lose".
    *   **Journaling:**
        *   Reflect on experiences by documenting thoughts and feelings.
        *   Track personal growth through written records.
    *   **Data-Driven Transformation:**
        *   Track relevant data related to goals.
        *   Use data to validate efforts and drive progress, like health tracking example.
    *   **Time Management & Scheduling:**
        *   Create and maintain a calendar.
        *   Protect time and improve coordination; get whole family and key people aligned with the calendar.
    *   **Vision Setting:**
        *   Establish a clear vision for personal, family, and business life.
        *   Engage others in the vision to achieve collective success.

3.  **Core Point:** Implementing keystone habits, such as taking action, learning from failures, journaling, tracking data, scheduling, and setting a vision, will transform your life and lead to a virtuous life.

4.  **Fundamental Point:** The key to achieving personal and professional success lies in intentionally cultivating habits that have a broad, positive influence on all areas of life.

5.  **Overarching Framework:** The framework is the identification and implementation of specific high-impact habits ("keystone habits") to achieve transformation and a better quality of life in personal and professional aspects.

 You want to achieve your goals and yet you're not sure how meaning you wrote them down But you haven't actually implemented the one thing that'll transform your life And what that is is simply creating habits and I prefer keystone habits keystone habits are things the wind implemented will affect all facets of your life and they're a huge deal in this video I want to go over how creating keystone habits can help you lead to a virtuous and therefore a good life The first habit is simply taking action now you have action versus thinking and it's really important that you are predisposed to taking action the way this is shown up for me in my life And I'm just gonna tell a short quick story. I'm walking back from the park I just played a game of soccer was a fantastic game I was full of pumped energy fully sweaty very muddy It was the middle of winter and I noticed next to our office that there was a real estate guy in front of the two houses Right next door to the office and the thing is I thought I wonder who that guy is He looks like a real estate person and then I took action. I went up to him and said hi My name is Daniel. I own this property over here. It's a commercial face. What's going on with these two properties turns out He had just purchased those properties. I had asked him if he'd be interested in selling them He was an investor. He was we shook hands right then and there We agreed to a price and two weeks later. I own the two lots next to the office that we currently occupy now What's cool about that story is it shows a desire for action like I'm constantly going after things wanting to buy Wanting to move forward wanting to take the next step and I think it's a superpower If you want to have a lot of success in your life now the two properties that we purchased means I own half an acre in downtown Sacramento which is a huge deal because eventually we're going to build apartments in that property and I think taking action is Basically the difference maker to having a great virtuous life Zig Ziglar says it if you can't take a big step now take the smallest step or any step that you can right here right now So the second keystone habit is simply replacing failure in your life with opportunity to learn Here's the perspective every time I take action I may or may not win meaning I'll take action and it's pretty much a 50 50 whether I'm gonna win or not However, the difference is if I lose I don't view it as a failure I view it as an opportunity to learn So when I first started in business one of the businesses that I started was a mortgage company And I remember the person that hooked up my internet for the business came in and said hey What do you do here? And I said I'm a real estate guy and he said oh, that's cool. Do you do mortgages? I'm like absolutely I do mortgages, but you know, obviously I'm setting up my office This is my day one come back in You know tomorrow and we can we can talk he left and I picked up the phone and I called a friend and I was like Hey, how do you do a mortgage and literally the idea of taking action and then not being afraid of failure is a Keystone habit that is a game changer for a leader or an entrepreneur or even just somebody who wants to live a virtuous life I think it's a very important keystone habit simply write down your Experience and your problems and reflect and think in your journal There's something about making a record of how you're thinking and feeling and then the opportunity of going back in time and seeing Who you were and seeing the personal growth? Inside of your own handwriting inside of your own life in in your experience So I think writing in a journal is a superpower Especially if you can document your journey number four whatever you want to transform in your life Get the data and track the data my wife and I are on this fitness crave right now In fact, we've hired chefs and we're really focused on eating right working out and just a lot of exercise and activity in our family And I have been bugging her for years that she needed to get a DEXA scan now a DEXA scan is simply a Big machine that scans your body. It gives you like bone density fat muscle your total weight It gives you a data and for years she wanted nothing to do with it. I'm not gonna do that You're crazy blah blah blah to track what you're eating track what you're actually putting into the body How often you're working out and then get a third-party data in order to validate your efforts and your energy And so this morning she calls me and she goes. Oh my god. I'm in the top 10 percentile and by the way I'm a 90%er and they blah blah blah blah and she's just going through everything that she's she's super jazzed and excited about the progress that she's made over the last couple of years and Forever she was resistant to actually getting this body scan So the keystone habit here anything you want to change in your life get the data track the data The data is your friend in this particular habit keeping a schedule and protecting your time My best example is with my wife and my family We didn't have a family calendar for the longest time and what I found is my wife was consistently nervous or had anxiety around who was gonna do what and where we were gonna be and what where we were going and so as a Family we sat down and said hey, how do we fix this and what we did is we built a calendar in Google that was our family calendar and Gave access and visibility to everybody in our lives that needed to help us coordinate and and basically organize our time So this keystone habit that first step was just making a family calendar And I could see my the stress in my family go down the next step was we actually got one of those huge Calendars the ones that fit on a wall and we physically wrote down all of our plans for the entire year like travel school vacations everything that we were doing whether it was work or personal or family related we wrote down like Easter and like All the holidays like where are we going for this one? What are we gonna do for this one? And what happened was I could see my kids my wife myself even Light up and get excited about the year because we had an epic year of travel now We started doing this about four years ago and that coordination of getting everybody on the same page Wow, this is gonna be a great trip or this is gonna be a great family event It really got everybody jazzed about what our future looked like so the keystone habit here is Protect your time and get a calendar get a calendar share it with your wife get it in your business and schedule things because it will Make super impact in your ability to be productive and organize your whole world So my best and final keystone habit for you is create vision in your family in your business in your personal life I have a lot of friends who have either either gotten a divorce or had business failure or had challenges in their personal life and health failures and every time I see these folks having huge challenges and Conversely when I see somebody having massive success I always look at hey What's the difference between these people and it typically centers around setting a vision that others can kind of circle into and get sucked Into so that you can have the help that you need in order to succeed in life and in business and family and all those things And I think the best Example of this is Maxwell says if you want to go fast go alone But if you want to go far go with others and if you can set this as a keystone habit This guy's the limit for you. You can achieve any of your dreams and goals I want to kind of give you a tool to create these keystone habits And it's important that as I've listed these out you're taking notes and thinking through in your own business life family All the things am I setting habits and are they keystone habits?
