Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Patient Encounter:**
    *   The author encountered a street cleaner who was visibly unwell.
    *   The cleaner admitted to having diabetes for over a year, which he had neglected.
    *   The cleaner was exhibiting multiple symptoms of severe diabetes: fatigue, elevated blood sugar, increased thirst and urination.

2.  **Diagnosis & Treatment:**
    *   Author persuaded the cleaner to get medical tests, which confirmed severe diabetes.
    *   The author prescribed a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula: Coptis chinensis, Scutellaria baicalensis, Phellodendron chinense, Moutan bark, and Alisma plantago-aquatica.
    *   This TCM formula aims to reduce the "fire" associated with diabetes, and also to nourish the blood.

3.  **Treatment Results:**
    *   The cleaner improved after 15 days of treatment, and significant recovery after 30 days and continued treatment.
    *   His blood sugar stabilized, and he no longer had diabetes symptoms.

4.  **Underlying Theory:**
    *   The author posits that diabetes is caused by "a fire arising from deficiency."
    *   The body's yang energy is deficient, causing a relative excess of "fire" which depletes yin energy and results in blood deficiency.

5. **TCM Approach**
    *  The author emphasized the importance of targeted medication, not just using many herbs.
    * TCM treatment does not lie in the quantity of the medicine but more in targeting the root of the disease.
    * The focus is on clearing the fire and nourish the blood which ultimately resolves the imbalances.

6.  **Author's Motivation:**
    *   The author does not seek fame or wealth but aims to heal patients.
    *   The author comes from a family with a good reputation and a long history as traditional Chinese medicine doctors.
    *   The motivation for practicing medicine is to reduce the financial burden and suffering of patients.

**Core Point:**

The core point of this content is that diabetes, according to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), can be treated effectively by understanding and resolving the underlying imbalance of fire arising from deficiency with targeted herbal formulas.

**Fundamental Point:**

The fundamental point is that the true purpose of medicine lies in healing patients and alleviating suffering, not in pursuing personal gain or recognition.

**Overarching Framework:**

The overarching framework is that of a TCM practitioner applying theory and practice to heal a patient's suffering from diabetes by focusing on the root cause, not just symptoms.

**Conceptual Map:**

Patient's condition ⭠ TCM diagnosis (Fire from deficiency) ⭢ TCM treatment (Herbal formula) ⭢ Patient's recovery ⭢  TCM theory based motivation ⭡  Practitioner's purpose (Healing over personal gain)
