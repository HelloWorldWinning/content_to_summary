 So one of the greatest investors the world has ever seen recently passed away at the ripe old age of 99 years old. And if you were to ask most people on the street, they would have no clue who this guy was. But Charlie Munger was revered in the world of finance as a sort of business Yoda. And he said something once that's really stuck with me. He said, in my whole life, I have known no wise people who didn't read all the time. None. Zero. And this has proven true time and again in my own personal experiences. But something I really struggled with at the beginning of my entrepreneurial journey was just figuring out which books are actually worth reading. I mean, a book can transform your life, but the harsh truth is that most books are nothing more than 300 pages of fluff surrounding one interesting idea. Well, I'm here to cut the fluff and I'm going to share with you some of the books that played a pivotal role in my life and I've used over the last 12 years in building a $100 million empire. Now on a side note, I recently did a video breaking down the 12 books that I reread every single year. So I'm going to leave those off this list, but you should go check out that video when you're done with this one to see my 12 favorite books of all time. Alright, for this video, I'm going to break these down into categories based on what I call the four spheres of influence, which are mindset, health, wealth, and skills. So let's dive in with the first sphere of influence, which is your mindset. The first book on the list is from one of the grandfathers of the stoic philosophy Seneca. This book is called letters from a stoic. Now stoicism has gained a lot of popularity over the past decade, thanks to the efforts of guys like Ryan Holliday, who've done just an incredible job translating these ancient works from modern audiences. And don't get me wrong, those books are great. But if you really want to understand something, you got to get as close to the source material as possible. For instance, if you want to learn economics, you go read wealth of nations and communist manifesto. If you want to learn about biology and evolution, go read the origin of species or the eighth day of creation. Reading from what's called primary sources is the best way to build a palatus work of understanding around a topic, because you're starting at the ground floor in building up your own knowledge base rather than just relying on somebody else's interpretation and then summary of that topic. So if you really want to learn about the stoic philosophy, I recommend you go straight to the primary sources, one of which is this book, letters from a stoic by Seneca. One of the things I love about it is it's just a treasure trove of wisdom broken down into easily digested sound bites. And this is one of my all time favorites. We are more often frightened than hurt, and we suffer more from imagination than from reality. Alright, the next book for developing your mindset is the Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz. I think the world would generally be a better place if everybody was required to read this book as a child. The lessons are simple yet profound and universally applicable. They are be impeccable with your word. Do not take anything personal. Do not make assumptions and always do
