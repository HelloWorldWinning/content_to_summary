Description:
Okay, here's a structured summary of the provided text, addressing all your requirements:

**Summary:**

**I. Love as "Something In Between"**

*   **A.  Rejection of Extremes:** The author doesn't endorse an anti-rationalist view that love ignores a person's qualities. Instead, love exists in a middle ground.
*   **B. Plato's Symposium Reference:**  Draws on Diotima's argument in Plato's Symposium: love is neither good nor bad, but "something in between." It's not purely logical or purely irrational.

**II. Love as a Vision:**

*   **A.  Focus on Positive Qualities:** Love is largely about directing attention towards the positive qualities of the beloved.
*   **B. Selective Perception:** Lovers often become blind to negative attributes, focusing intensely on the positive ones.
*  **C.  Subjective to Objective:** Lovers perceive the subjective qualities of the beloved as objective.
*   **D. Irrationality:** This vision of love leads to irrationality in two ways:
    *   **Moral Irrationality:** Love can lead to immoral and selfish behavior.
    *   **Epistemic Irrationality:** Love can lead to false beliefs about the beloved and a distorted reality.

**III.  The "Apple of Your Eye":**

*   **A.  Positive Response to Properties:** Loving someone involves a positive response to their attractive, desirable, and valuable traits.
*   **B.  Beloved at the Center:** The lover's perception of the world revolves around the beloved, placing the beloved at the center of their field of vision.
*   **C.  Universal Qualities:** The qualities that trigger love are general properties used to judge everyone (e.g., beauty, intelligence, humor).
*   **D.  Special Attention:** The value placed on the beloved's traits isn't unique to the trait itself, but because of the *special attention* given to the individual.
*   **E. Love Creates a Unique Vision** Through the lens of love, flaws are insignificant, allowing the lover to see the beloved and the world in an enhanced way, even if it entails a kind of blindness.

**IV. The Beloved’s Perspective &  Non-Neutrality:**

*   **A. Awe and Singularity:** Similar responses are prompted by the natural world (oceans, ecosystems), where the object is genuinely singular or perceived to be, making comparison irrelevant.
*   **B.  Beyond Universal Properties:** Love is also a response to non-universal or uniquely perceived properties in the beloved.
*  **C.  Non-Neutrality:**  Human nature compels us to value things from a non-neutral, personally invested viewpoint.
*   **D. Identification:** The lover does not simply assess the beloved’s qualities but identifies with the beloved, unifying their perspectives.

**Core Point:** Love is neither purely rational nor purely irrational; it occupies a middle ground, characterized by selective attention, intensified perception, and a non-neutral, personal investment in the beloved.

**Fundamental Point:**  Love, by its very nature, involves a subjective and often distorted perception of reality, where the beloved is placed at the center of the lover's world, making objective evaluation impossible.

**Overarching Framework:** The content presents an analysis of love through the lens of perception, rationality, and value, drawing upon classical philosophy and using examples from art and nature to illustrate its points.

Content:
But he doesn’t want to go so far as to defend an anti-rationalist view of love which denies the claim that love is a response to a person’s characteristics or properties. He thinks love is something in between, and to illuminate this, he references a passage from Plato’s Symposium in which Socrates corrects Agathon’s view of love. It will be easiest for me to proceed the way Diotima did… she showed me how, according to my own speech, Love is neither beautiful nor good. So I said, “What do you mean, Diotima? Is Love ugly then, and bad?” But she said, “Watch your tongue! Do you really think that, if a thing is not beautiful, it has to be ugly?… Don’t force whatever is not beautiful to be ugly, or whatever is not good to be bad. It’s the same with Love: when you agree he is neither good nor beautiful, you need not think he is ugly and bad; he could be something in between.” Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty, F. Holland Day , 1896/7, via The Art Institute of Chicago Vision View of Love “I suggest that we take advantage of Diotima’s metaphorical scheme and explore the notion that love, is, indeed “something in between.” Love as a vision means love is largely attention directed towards the positive qualities of the beloved. Because of this, the lover is often blind to negative attributes. Love leads us to create and hold false beliefs about the beloved; the lover finds value in the beloved’s subjective qualities and has true in their heart that these are objective qualities. Thus, love is irrational in two senses. From a moral standpoint, love can inspire immoral, wrong, and selfish behavior. From an epistemic perspective, love causes us to live in a false reality. Portrait of a Woman, John Wollaston , 1749/52, via The Art Institute of Chicago “ Apple of Your Eye” “Loving someone is, in large part, a kind of positive, appreciative response to her in virtue of her attractive, desirable, or otherwise valuable properties. The way of seeing the beloved, and the world in which the beloved lives, places her at the center of the lover’s field of vision.” The “things” that the lover has this positive response to are universal qualities or properties used to judge everyone in desirability; the person’s physical attractiveness, intelligence, morality, sense of humor, etc. These properties seem unique, such as beauty, but even if another person were beautiful in the same way, it would not make the lover value the individual’s beauty less. Instead, it is how we see the beauty of the important individual, and this is through the special attention we give to the beloved. This special attention causes the beloved to become the center of our world. As a result, we see the beloved in the best possible light, and although the beloved has flaws, our love renders them insignificant. Doing this allows us to open our eyes to the beloved, which opens our eyes to the world. In doing so, we become blind to many other aspects of the world and the beloved. Male Nude Seen from the Back, Possibly Domenico Maggiotto , 1733/94, via The Art Institute of Chicago The Beloved’s Perspective “Natural objects, too, can provoke such responses. Some of them – the ocean, the earth’s ecosystem, or the “starry heavens above”… cannot be compared in part because they are genuinely singular; there is simply nothing to compare them to. But the deeper fact is that even if there were potential objects of comparison, comparison would still be out of place. Whatever precise basis for one’s awestruck response to the starry sky or ecosystem, such awe does not seem anywhere to contain the thought of that objects being better…” Love is a response to the beloved’s universal properties and a response to non-universal properties in the beloved. Human nature allows and forces us to value things from a non-neutral standpoint, a place where detachment and objective standards are forbidden. The lover doesn’t assess these non-universal properties of the beloved but instead identifies with the beloved; this unites the lover’s perspective with that of the beloved.
