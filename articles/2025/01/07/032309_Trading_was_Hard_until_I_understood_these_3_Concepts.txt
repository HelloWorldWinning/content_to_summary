Description:
Okay, here's a structured summary of the provided text:

**I. Key Ideas:**

*   **Initial Impulsive Trading:** New traders often make impulsive decisions based on a single observation (e.g., price at resistance), leading to bias and losses.
*   **Evolution Through Experience:**  Experience, losses, and market humbling force a shift towards considering multiple factors rather than relying on single conditions.
*   **The Mindset Shift:**
    *   **Multi-Factor Analysis:** Successful trading involves analyzing various factors such as trend (large and small), support/resistance, economic news, market conditions, and potential supply and demand areas.
    *  **Thinking Like Other Traders:** Anticipating the actions and thought process of both bull and bear traders (where they take profit, cut losses, etc.).
    *   **Conditional Trading:**  Developing an "if this, then that" approach based on multiple conditions being met, rather than simply predicting market movement.
    * **Risk Management:** It's crucial to take into consideration risk versus reward, establish take profit and stop loss for each trade.

**II. Summary Structure**

*   **Introduction:** New traders often make impulsive decisions based on single observations.
*  **Challenge:** Over-reliance on a single condition for entering a trade is unsustainable and often leads to losses.
*   **Transformation:**  A shift from impulsive trading to a more strategic approach, involving the analysis of multiple factors and thinking from the perspective of other traders, becomes crucial for consistent success.
*   **Key Aspects of the Shift:**
    *  Analyze multiple factors.
    *  Anticipate other traders' behavior.
    *  Establish clear conditions before entering trades and risk management.
    *   Take both long and short trades into consideration.
*   **Conclusion:** This shift in mindset is what ultimately transforms a beginner into an advanced and disciplined trader.

**III. Core Point (One Sentence):**

Successful trading requires a shift from impulsive, single-condition based decisions to a multi-faceted approach that considers various market conditions and the likely actions of other traders.

**IV. Fundamental Point (One Sentence):**

Consistent profitability in trading is achieved by developing a disciplined and conditional mindset that prioritizes risk management over impulsive action.

**V. Overarching Framework:**

The content focuses on the transition in mindset from a novice trader to a more advanced trader. This is achieved through a step-by-step process: starting with the common mistake of jumping into trades based on one condition and learning through losses and experience, then to a sophisticated approach that considers multiple factors and other traders' behavior.

when you've been trading for as long as I have which it's been going on eight years now you oftentimes forget what it was like to think like your old self so when you just get started out trading you might have a lot of thoughts that make you very impulsive like for example you just look at this chart right now and you think wow it's going down you know I'm gonna short I'm gonna go all in short because it's going down I mean if you look right here it went down it went down you know you're just looking left and you're making an impulsive decision based off of one thing that you see that lines up with your thought process so you can easily become very biased in the market when you're new but once you get humbled and you gain some experience in the market and you incur some losses which definitely will happen you start to realize very quickly that just one condition being met for example being near resistance is not enough for you to take a trade now sometimes it'll work in your favor but oftentimes what happens if you go all in at resistance and we we break resistance and continue to the upside so you have to be prepared at all times for both sides of the trait however there was one point in my trading career where things just really shifted and it had a lot to do with the way that I was thinking and perceiving the market and Traders on both sides of the market so bull Traders bear Traders people who are going long and people who are going short so when I started to take into perspective okay the bigger picture and I understand that yes we might catch some resistance here but overall where is the bigger Trend and where do I think it's going to go and then I started to have different conditions that needed to be met not just one but typically three for an A plus tree and so once you start to adjust your thought process to say okay yes we are at resistance but where is larger Trend we are technically still in an uptrend based off the five minute time frame that I'm on right now yes we are hitting previous resistance to the left we also are about to have really massive news in three minutes so GDP and jobs data so I probably can understand that we are pulling back but I'm not going to take this I am going to take it with a grain of salt because we're about to have massive news come out that could move the market so that's something else I'm taking in a factor another thing that I am considering is the fact that okay rule of Threes that's just something that I've done over the years where typically trend lines can get hit three times one time two times three times so this is going to be a big level and a big hit on this trend line for cl so if we are looking to short we need to see this trend line broken but not only that we're looking left and seeing we've created higher support here near this red line which is why I have it drawn so there are multiple conditions and multiple factors always being taken in at every single moment which is why I love trading it's not just plain black and white there are always things that you need to be considering at every level where's the trend where is the large Trend in the small all Trend where our buyers where our sellers where support resistance supply and demand are is there economic news coming out that could create extra volatility in the markets what's going on in overall market conditions where is spy at or ES if you're trading Futures you know where is the larger picture on overall market conditions elsewhere so I'm always taking in multiple factors is there oil inventories coming out if you're trading oil so understanding that there's so many moving pieces which can be very overwhelming for a new Trader is really key but let's go back to that mindset shift because not only did I start to take in multiple factors and multiple things that could affect my trades that was just one thing that shifted for me the other thing that shifted is again going back to how I saw buyers and sellers so when I was looking to take a trade and we can use the example that I actually just did in Discord so I typically am always looking at a bull side and a bear side now in this case you can see that I have a larger point of view that if we come back to Trend and hold higher support here I think we're going to come in a micro range which is just a fib strategy I created and I also want to show you this trade that we took here so this was a little bit of a closer point of view on CL basically what I was looking to happen is I understood that from a bigger point of view and I hope I don't lose you guys here because it can get a little bit a little bit deep so especially for trading so what I'm doing in my thought process is I am anticipating the fact that I do want to go long if this trend in gray box and red line like this area right here holds and finds buyers but in the meantime I would consider a quick short to this range to this trend line because in my head with news about to come out I took this trade at around 8 10 I believe we can go back and look in a second with news about to come out and we already topping off at previous resistance I don't necessarily think we're gonna flush down but I do think that it is a likelihood we're going to see Trend hit because people want to see from larger perspectives so people who are taking in the bigger picture Trend will most likely want to see Trend hit a third time before taking that entry or before cutting if you bought down here so their stop loss is probably Loosely being followed by this trend line so I'm always taking in a factor okay if people bought down here where are they selling if people are looking to short up here where would they take profits if you know we didn't continue and break this trend so not only am I taking in my perspective on the markets I'm taking in what I think other Traders are thinking as well which that becomes very advanced in the trading world and it can almost make you a little bit too confused at some points because you are taking in so many different narratives so for example my brain you know works that way but it's like okay if we drop down and hit this red line gray box trend line here I'm gonna look for along to the upside but if we drop down and we start losing Trend losing Red Line making lower highs I'm going to look for a short down to 68.50 which is next FIB to the downside but if we're continuing to the upside I'm looking for micro wrench to hit next which is 70 22 to 70 63. so you can see that it's always if this happens then I'm doing this if that happens then I'm doing that and when that shifted in my trading journey I can't tell you exactly what happened but things started to click and I started to think like an actual Trader and not somebody who was just so trigger happy and if I saw one thing I was just jumping in a trade based off that one condition being met and that just makes it if it if you just have one thing that you're trading off of again for example if you're just looking saying oh you know we caught resistance here I'm gonna short you know I think a lot of times that can work but in the long run it won't get you very far because there's going to be too many times where you just jump in a trade your confidence is very high you've got one condition being met and eventually that one condition is going to get you in trouble and you can have a second condition that says okay my stop is here my entry is here so you know creating those bracket orders where you've got your take profit your stop loss in place that's a second condition because it's making you think about your risk versus reward now I'm talking about the people who just jump in and they don't even have the second condition of thinking okay is this risk worth the reward that I'm taking I'm talking about the people because I used to do this all the time in the beginning that seeds were at resistance really doesn't have a Target in mind so they don't have a take profit they're just hoping we break Trend in flush all the way down which we might but I think those people are usually the ones that end up hurting the most and end up setting back their growth the most because they're not thinking like an advanced Trader and that's why I make these videos is because I didn't think this way for a very long time the only reason I started to think this way is because I watched so many YouTube videos and it was just trial and error I eventually learned like oh wow you know I'm probably losing because I just jumped in short with no real plan and the only reason that I jumped in that trade was because I thought it was a good idea to go short which it was but the fact that I didn't think about a take profit or a stop loss or you know where bigger Trend was made it to where I always was losing any profits I made or if I you know jumped in and was automatically losing I didn't know where to cut it so I would freeze up and just let my account dwindle away so different conditions being met is a huge thing and then thinking like the other Trader so if you are looking to take a long trade think like the bear where is that bear taking profits where is that bear you know considering getting out of their trade and then vice versa so let me show you guys an example right now I'm not going to do a live trade because I'm pretty much done for the day that's one reason I absolutely am obsessed with Futures is most of the time I am done before 9am so before Market even opens I'm Eastern Time right now so Market opens at 9 30. I am typically trading between like 7 A.M and 9 A.M and then I've got the rest of the day to do with whatever I want and I'm really really digging it because I just have so much more success trading in pre-market it's less stressful in my opinion but really quick let's go check back to what I wanted to happen so I sent this to the group this morning I was like this is what I'm looking for and I hope you guys love my drawings where I wanted us to draw back down I wanted to temporarily break trendline because I thought that would trap shorts and they weren't looking left to see that we did form a higher support here so as long as we held over the red line I was looking to buy dips in this gray box and then I was looking to move up into micro range now if we did not hold over the red line and we were making lower highs underneath then Bulls no longer have control and I'm no longer going to be looking for bullish trade so you see how I don't have a bias I am very flexible with all the trades I take if this happens then I'll do this if that doesn't happen I won't do that you know so it's just making sure you have multiple conditions that are being met and you always have that if this then that you know if this happens I'll do that so it's not necessarily you predicting a move it's just you being prepared to react if this prediction plays out in your favor so for example if we would have just which we are kind of now we are testing this red line so if we would have just flush all the way down here then my bullish play that I just posted is no longer valid you know it's invalid at that point because what I want to see is Wick only Wick below this red line candle body holding over and then we start to move up like that picture showed now if we are not wicking here and we are candle body closing underneath this red line then I may or may not I don't think I'm gonna flip short because I already caught a nice short down to this trend line and it's just a little bit too risky for me right now the main trade that I would like to take is if we Wick here candle body close over and then start to move up then I will take a long trade in order for me to take a short trade I would probably need to see some lower highs print here first and then I'll look to jump in on Trend continuation to the downside but it's always multiple conditions being met and I'm always thinking about both sides of every trade and that was the main point of this video it's just to get you guys to start thinking like that to get you guys to start thinking you know like that that shift that happened a long time of me it was probably just because I had so many losses but you have to start thinking like an advanced Trader in order to be able to be consistent and make the games that you want if you are always thinking the same thoughts and if you are always doing the same things that means you are always repeating the same bad habits meaning jumping into plays without proper risk management or a proper strategy or Edge you are just going to consistently see the same bad results so just like anything else in life you have to get disciplined and start thinking differently and again that's why I make these videos so hopefully I can help somebody start to think differently which is what really transformed my trading and hopefully will transform yours as well I do want to highlight because I know that my channel has been very options focused over like probably my entire Channel I did transition a little while ago into Futures and and I am absolutely obsessed if you guys want me to do a video on why I made the switch let me know in the comments down below but just a couple things is you can trade them in pre-market which is amazing and there's no Greeks it's just a lot less variables so I have been absolutely obsessed with Futures and I definitely am focusing on that heavily in the group I also included that in the eight week program if you want any information on all of that make sure to check the master link in the description box down below it is labeled peachy investor program plus Discord so you shouldn't be able to miss that and last thing I just want to remind you guys please do not fall for any scammers I will never direct message you I'll never direct message you on Discord so any of my members are watching this just a reminder and I will never direct message you on Instagram or any platform so if you get a direct message or a friend request it is a scammer it is somebody cloning my profile it is not me please do not fall for that I do not trade crypto and that's a wrap for today thank you so much for watching and I will see you next time
