Description:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided content, following your specified format:

**Summary:**

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   The video aims to explain "real liquidity" in trading, moving away from common explanations.
    *   Traditional definitions of liquidity focus on market activity and trading volume.

2.  **Liquidity Defined for Market Makers:**
    *   Market makers (banks, hedge funds) need liquidity to execute large orders.
    *   This explanation shifts the focus from general trading volume to institutional needs.

3.  **Liquidity Pools on Charts:**
    *   Highs and lows are commonly known areas with liquidity.
    *   Less obvious liquidity pools exist at:
        *   Order blocks
        *   Supply and demand zones
    *   These areas often follow periods of consolidation, where order buildup leads to liquidity.
    *   Price tends to be drawn back to these zones, indicating the pull of liquidity.

4.  **Real Secret to Liquidity:**
    *   Identify market moves that leave a "streak" of untouched order blocks or supply/demand zones.
    *   These zones create significant directional pull on price.

5.  **Identifying Reversals:**
    *   **Change of Character (CHoCH):** A structural break indicating a market turn.
    *   **Wedge Pattern:**  A preferred entry signal with reduced drawdown, especially useful when there is strong liquidity on one side of the wedge.

6. **Live Trade Example:**
    * A funded account trade was taken using the Key level wedge pro dashboard (or individual indicators for MT5), focusing on wedge pattern entry.

**Core Point:** The true understanding of liquidity lies in recognizing untouched order blocks and supply/demand zones as powerful magnets that drive price movement.

**Fundamental Point:**  Instead of focusing on general market volume, traders should identify and use institutional liquidity pools, especially when seeking reversal entries at key levels.

**Overarching Framework:** The video presents a strategy for trading by interpreting liquidity not as simple volume, but as directional pull driven by institutional order flow in specific areas of the price chart, namely supply/demand and order blocks.

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en You always hear about "liquidity" when it comes to trading. And soon as you look up information on the subject, you find the same concepts over, and over again. But today, i will steer you away from the information used by the trading crowds and masses and show you the real liquidity. Alright, so what is Liquidity? According to forex. com, Liquidity refers to how active a market is. It is determined by how many traders are actively trading and the total volume they're trading. Okay, lets try and put that into simpler terms. So basically market makers, as in banks and finacial institutions like hedge funds, need liquidity to offload their large orders. i can already hear you thinking, "Thats all fun and dandy but how does this information help with my trades? " Alright, lets speed things up and take a look at some chart examples. It is said the "highs" and the "lows" are the places where there are large pools of liquidity and market makers hunt them in what is called a liquidity grab. but there are key levels which go unnoticed which also have liquidity, and these are order blocks and supply and demand zones. They often appear in areas where the market has previously consolidated, indicating a buildup of orders hence we find pools of liquidity there. Now lets look at some past supply and demand zones, notice how price is attracted and always comes back to touch the zones. I think you get the idea and see how the liquidity inside the zones pulls the price. Now the Real secret to liquidity is to look for a market move which leaves a large streak of untouched Order blocks or Supply and demand zones like this. And with all this liquidity, you can imagine how great the force pulling and attracting price downward here. Here is another example to the opposite side. Now that we have a strong directional bias, how do we know when to enter the reversal? One way is to wait for the Change of Character (CHoCH), this will indicate that price is now turning around. Another way, and my favourite, is to wait for a wedge pattern to form and then enter. Notice how trades from this have very little drawdown due to the strong pull from the liquidity above. Now lets look at a live trade example i took on a funded account. On the Mt4 i was using the Key level wedge pro dashboard, but for Mt5 there's no dashboard yet, so i use the individual indicators. Links for all of them in the description. Here i was waiting for a break of structucture to show Change of Character but it didnt break so i decided to place the Key level wedge indicator and take a wedge trade instead. And the rest. . . was history. . . Stay tuned for the next "Trading Secrets" video. you wont want to miss it. Happy trading.
