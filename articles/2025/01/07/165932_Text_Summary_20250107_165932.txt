Description:
Okay, here's a structured summary of the provided text:

**Summary:**

*   **I. Introduction:**
    *   Love is a multifaceted human experience, encompassing various forms.
    *   Philosophy of love seeks to understand and explain the nature of love.
    *   This exploration will focus on three philosophical works: Jollimore's *Love's Vision*, Lewis' *The Four Loves*, and Plato's *Symposium*.
*   **II. Troy Jollimore's *Love's Vision***:
    *   **A. Core Argument:** Jollimore aims to explain the inherent contradictions of love.
    *   **B. Love and Morality:**
        *   Love is situated between moral and immoral, reason and unreason.
        *   Love can inspire idealistic treatment but also possessive and harmful behavior.
        *   Excessive focus on a lover can lead to neglect of other responsibilities.
    *   **C. Love is Blind:**
        *   Jollimore challenges the notion of "love is blind."
        *   Love places the beloved at the center of one's world, but simultaneously limits perception.
        *   Love illuminates certain aspects while making us blind to others.
    *   **D. Love and Reason:**
        *   Jollimore critiques the idea that love is entirely separate from reason.
        *   He argues against hyper-rationalist views that claim love is completely independent of reasons or properties in the beloved.

*   **III. Further Context:**
    *   The summary provides a foundational understanding of Jollimore's "vision view of love," that is a kind of perception, that is always a matter of being limited because a perceiving agent is situated in a particular time, place and situation.
    *   The work introduces other key points to be explored later within Lewis and Plato.

**Core Point (One Sentence):** Jollimore's *Love's Vision* argues that love is a complex phenomenon, a form of perception that can be both illuminating and blinding, existing in a tension between morality and immorality, and reason and unreason.

**Fundamental Point (One Sentence):** Love, according to Jollimore, is not just a feeling but a way of seeing and experiencing the world that inherently alters and limits our perception and is both a moral and immoral, reasonable and unreasonable emotion.

**Overarching Framework:** The overarching framework is a comparative philosophical exploration of love. The provided text focuses solely on Jollimore's work, using his concepts of vision, morality and reason to begin the framework.

Love is a pervasive phenomenon in all human life and comes in many forms: love of people, animals, objects, ideas, and more. The philosophy of love seeks to explain and rationalize the nature of love . Below are three works by philosophers that explore the question of love. First, we will look at Troy Jollimore’s book Love’s Vision , in which he explains the vision view of love. Next, C.S. Lewis provides a Christian account of the nature of love in his book The Four Loves. Finally, we will look at Plato’s dialogue The Symposium, in which we see a metaphysical account of love and its connection to beauty. Love’s Vision: Troy Jollimore’s Philosophy of Love Eye of Maria Miles Heyward, Edward Greene Malbone , 1802, via The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Troy Jollimore ’s philosophy of love focuses on providing an account of love that explains the contradictions often found when examining the nature of love: “[love] being both a moral emotion and a potential source of immorality, an emotion that encourages clear-sightedness in some contexts and delusion in others, and an emotion that involves, in significant ways, both reason and unreason.” Love and Morality “Love is something in between the purely moral and the deeply immoral and between reason and utter unreason.” He first looks at the concept of love and morality . Jollimore argues that reason guides love but, at the same time, not entirely. To illuminate this point, he asks if love is moral. He points to the idealistic notion that lovers want each other to flourish. Thus they treat them better than anyone else in their lives. In contrast, he points out that sometimes lovers want the beloved all to themselves; they remove them from their family, friends, and society.

Long-term commitment often leads to resentment, hostility, and unkind treatment. Further, and more worrying for Jollimore, excessive focus and kindness on the lover lead to neglect of other important things. Love is Blind “In speaking of love in terms of vision… love is, in a very real way, a kind of perception, a way of the seeing the world. And perception is always a matter of being limited because a perceiving agent is situated in a particular time, place and situation.” He then looks to the concept “love is blind” and believes this is flawed. Two notions of love guide Jollimore’s vision view of love. First, to love another person is to place them at the center of your world, such as the earth that revolves around the sun. Second, love illuminates things that we were blind to before, and we perceive the world in this light. The second notion is fundamental to Jollimore’s argument in his philosophy of love: he believes that love not only alters the way we see the lover and the world positively but, love also makes us not see, notice, or react to certain aspects of the world. The Lovers, William Powell Frith , 1855, via The Art Institute of Chicago Love and Reason “ The idea that love has little or nothing to do with reason is closely connected to the idea that love has nothing whatsoever to do with reasons. Reasons, in the context of love, are frequently regarded as simply irrelevant.” Finally, he looks to the idea that reason does not guide love. Jollimore thinks that the (hyper) rationalist viewpoint of the philosophy of love is flawed. The rationalist view being that love is not a condition or matter of reason or rationality in any sense; any list of properties in the beloved will not obligate the lover to love them.
