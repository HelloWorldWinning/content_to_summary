 What do American girls really think about marriage? To be honest, from my experience, I would say that most of us don't want to get married at all. But that's not to say that there aren't a lot of people here who still want to get married, and of course everyone has their own opinions about marriage. But overall, I think the trend is that most Americans are not getting married or they're getting married much later in life. First, I think it's really important to understand that our dating culture is really different, and most people here will date purely out of love, and we don't really consider too much about our partner's financial status or their job or how much property they have, and no, there is no tie in America. Usually, after you're married, you'll go buy house together and combine your incomes to pay it off together. So when we're dating, we basically just think it's important to find someone with similar values and similar life goals, but mostly we want someone that we can fall in love with, and someone who brings joy and happiness to our day-to-day life. Because if we're going to spend the rest of our life with one person, it better be someone that we truly want to see every day. So why don't American girls want to get married? There are two main reasons, and the first one is that it's super hard to find a really good guy here. A lot of American guys don't do any household chores. They're not really good at taking care of the kids, and they can be extremely selfish. So for girls, after they get married, they're expected to keep doing their full-time jobs, and take care of the house, and do all of the child care. So I can tell you from experience of watching my mom do this, it can get really, really exhausting. In Chinese, there's the phrase, and I think a lot of people think that America isn't this way, but in most places, I would say it really is, and girls are expected to do a lot more than boys. For example, I have three brothers, and I'm the only daughter, so I was expected to do a lot more than them, and before I was even 10 years old, I could cook, clean, do the dishes, mow the yard, take care of the house, and take care of my younger brothers. Literally, anything needed to be done around the house, I could do it, and I was expected to do it. But even to this day, I don't even think that some of my brothers know how to do the laundry. So there are a lot of things in American culture that are really unfair for women, and in turn, it's kind of given us this negative impression of marriage. And this leads us to the second reason that American girls don't really want to get married anymore, which is because these days, most girls can live a very full and happy life being totally independent. More and more women are getting a better education, which leads them to higher paying jobs, and being able to fully support themselves. In the past, girls were expected to get married and have kids and just live as a housewife, and if you didn't do this, it was basically socially unacceptable, and you could be ostracized from society. But now, I would say, most of the girls that I know are living perfectly happy lives, being totally independent, and they have a good group of friends and family who support them, while they go study or work to support themselves. Getting married is definitely not the main focus of their entire life. I think it's super important that girls are able to have this choice to choose what they want their future to be, and while it may be the case that most Americans don't really want to get married, there are still plenty of Americans who do get married, especially if you go to some smaller towns in America, where the cost of living is much lower and people can have a more relaxed lifestyle, you'll be able to see more and more people getting married and having kids because they don't need to work so much or they can rely on one person's income if they have a really good job. So in these situations, there are some women who are housewives, and there's no real negative connotation to this word, unless you say it like she's just a housewife, then it can come off as really judgmental. Most Americans don't really judge when someone says they're a housewife or a stay-at-home mom or something like that, because we know how hard it is to take care of the whole house and to raise kids basically on your own. Some people might feel jealous or they might feel like those women aren't living up to their full potential by just being a housewife, but those judgmental people are really just a minority. So even though a lot of American girls are choosing not to get married recently, I would say that deep down, a lot of us still do want to get married, it's just really hard to find the right person. I think marriage should be pretty simple and easy and really romantic as long as we have that right person, but without that person, I think it just makes life way more difficult for a lot of women. Anyway, I hope this video helped you understand more about American culture, and let me know in the comments if you share any similar thoughts or feelings, or if you have any questions, feel free to ask, and I'll see you guys next time. Bye-bye.
