Description:
**Summary Outline:**

1.  **NPD Self-Fashioning (自炼观想):**
    *   Individuals with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) present themselves as "masters" and then transition to "victims."
    *   They project their own needs onto others, giving the impression of unconditional acceptance.
    *   They craft a perfect image and induce others to internalize their needs, leading them to fulfill the NPD individual's desires.

2.  **Information Processing Differences:**
    *   **NPD (自炼者):** Rigid and unyielding in their beliefs. They filter information to match their pre-existing views, ignoring or distorting anything that challenges them. Their defenses reject any attempt to counter their self-image.
    *   **Victims (受害者):** More malleable and susceptible to manipulation. NPD individuals can easily input and alter their beliefs, undermining their sense of self.

3.  **Manipulation Tactics:**
    *   Undermining the victim’s intuition, memory, and self-worth.
    *   Gaslighting: Making the victim doubt their perceptions with phrases like "You're overthinking," "You're too sensitive," "You misunderstood me."
    *   Gradually changing the victim's thoughts and feelings, leading to increasing compliance.

4.  **Psychological Remolding:**
    *   Victims unknowingly lose their independent judgment of reality.
    *   This manipulation is a form of deep psychological re-shaping that goes beyond mere emotional control.

**Core Point:** NPD individuals manipulate others by projecting their needs, distorting information, and undermining their victims' sense of self, leading to a loss of independent judgment.

**Fundamental Point:** The difference in how NPD individuals and victims process information allows for the manipulation to occur, with NPD individuals being rigid and victims being malleable.

**Overarching Framework:** This content describes a cycle of manipulation in relationships involving individuals with NPD, detailing their tactics and the psychological impact on their victims. It's a breakdown of NPD individuals' manipulative strategies and their consequences.
