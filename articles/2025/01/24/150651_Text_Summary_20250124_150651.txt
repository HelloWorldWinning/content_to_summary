As AI becomes more advanced, it will solve increasingly complex and critical problems. It also takes significantly more compute to power these capabilities. 

Today, we’re adding ChatGPT Pro, a $200 monthly plan that enables scaled access to the best of OpenAI’s models and tools. This plan includes unlimited access to our smartest model, OpenAI o1, as well as to o1-mini, GPT-4o, and Advanced Voice. It also includes o1 pro mode, a version of o1 that uses more compute to think harder and provide even better answers to the hardest problems. In the future, we expect to add more powerful, compute-intensive productivity features to this plan. 

ChatGPT Pro provides a way for researchers, engineers, and other individuals who use research-grade intelligence daily to accelerate their productivity and be at the cutting edge of advancements in AI.
More thinking power for more difficult problems
ChatGPT Pro provides access to a version of our most intelligent model that thinks longer for the most reliable responses. In evaluations from external expert testers, o1 pro mode produces more reliably accurate and comprehensive responses, especially in areas like data science, programming, and case law analysis.

Compared to both o1 and o1-preview, o1 pro mode performs better on challenging ML benchmarks across math, science, and coding.
Competition Math (AIME 2024)

To highlight the main strength of o1 pro mode (improved reliability), we use a stricter evaluation setting: a model is only considered to solve a question if it gets the answer right in four out of four attempts ("4/4 reliability"), not just one.

Pro users can access this functionality by selecting o1 pro mode in the model picker and asking a question directly. Since answers will take longer to generate, ChatGPT will display a progress bar and send an in-app notification if you switch away to another conversation.
