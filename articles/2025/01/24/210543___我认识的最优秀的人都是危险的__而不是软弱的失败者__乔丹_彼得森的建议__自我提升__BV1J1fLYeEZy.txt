Description:
好的，这是对你提供的内容的总结，包括核心观点、根本观点、框架结构以及使用 Mermaid 语法生成的概念图：

**1. 核心观点（Core Point）:**

一个人必须整合自身的阴影面（包括攻击性），才能真正变得强大和善良，仅仅依靠压制和恐惧无法建立真正的道德。

**2. 根本观点（Fundamental Point）:**

真正的道德并非源于对犯罪的恐惧或单纯的服从，而是源于对自身能力（包括邪恶能力）的认知和控制，以及在必要时敢于拒绝不公正的勇气。

**3. 框架结构 (Overarching Framework):**

*   **弱者的困境：**
    *   道德上的软弱导致依赖他人、内心苦涩和报复心。
    *   缺乏直面挑战和做出正确选择的能力。
    *   无法抵抗社会压力和不公正的要求。
*  **强者的特质：**
    *  能够控制自身能力（包括潜在的危险性）。
    *  拥有拒绝不公正要求的勇气，敢于说“不”。
    *  通过整合阴影面，获得真正的道德力量和影响力。
*   **道德的本质：**
    *   真正的道德不是单纯的无害，而是对自身能力的控制和有意识的抉择。
    *   压制而非整合阴影面会导致心理和道德上的虚弱。
    *  真正的道德需要整合攻击性，拥有拒绝不义的能力，而不是仅仅出于恐惧或服从而表现得“道德”。

 Well, weak people are a problem. I don't mean physically weak. I mean cowardly, let's say, and deceitful, because I'm thinking it more in terms of moral weakness. Well, there's a variety of reasons, first of all, if you can't support your own weight, let's say, then someone else has to do it. And that's not good. And then if you don't pick a forthright and useful and noble pathway through life, then you'll become bitter and too hurt by the tragedy of existence. And then you tend to seek your revenge wherever you can get it. And that's not good. So it's a mistake on all fronts. It's not good for you. It's not good for your family. It's not good for the community. It's certainly not a good medium to long-term strategy, because life is very, very difficult. You know, the best people I've ever met are dangerous people, but they keep themselves in check. I met Jocka Willink. He's a good example. I mean, Willink was the commander in Ramadan, I think. You know, you can say what you want about American military involvement has nothing to do with that, really, not at this level of analysis. He's a tough guy. I follow him on Twitter. Yeah, so you know, he gets up every morning at 5.30. He's a tough guy. He said, he told me, he's great straightforwardly, that he was one of those kids that as an adolescent could have gone either way, right? He could have been highly successful street criminal. Yeah, probably. But yeah, probably. Well, you can see it. But he decided not to do that. And you know, he's very, I would say he's a seal, right? Mm-hmm, that's right. He's psychophysiologically intimidating. He's a big guy. You can tell he knows how to use it. And you can tell he used it. But as far as I can tell, he's a good person. And that's how all of that capacity for mayhem is part of what makes him a good person. And people know that. That's why they're listening to him. And like I said, the other people I've met, the men I've met who are good men, they're all like that. They're all dangerous. In the Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is obviously the hero of the story. He's touched by malevolence, right? The only reason he can stand up against evil is because there's some evil in him that he's incorporated essentially. Well that's exactly right. The persona, if you're a persona, then you're an obedient citizen. But the problem with being an obedient citizen is that if the society tells you to march the Jews off to the death camp, for example, and you're obedient, then that's what you'll do. And it doesn't, it isn't like society is civilized, then all of a sudden you're performing some act of atrocity. That isn't how it works. It's like you're obedient citizen and then you're asked to violate your conscience a little bit. And you have to because you don't have anything other than that persona. And so not obedience. And so a little more obedience is demanded. You say, okay, well then you're a little bent because the society is becoming a little bent. And then you're a little weaker. Then you're asked to violate your conscience a little bit more. And you think, well there's a little less of me and the pressure's on a little more. And I could have said no before, but I didn't. So you say yes again. Then you say yes again. And then you have a society where one third of the population is informing on the other two thirds. It's hell. It's like, well, so how do you say no? Well that's the shadow. It's like, and that's, see the reason that the video I did was about Bill C-16 and its compelled speech. Provisions went viral. It was because I said no. I didn't say it casually. What I meant was there isn't anything that you can do to me that I can imagine that will force me to utter the words that you want me to utter. Nothing. And I meant it. And when I made the video, I think people could actually tell that I meant it. And so I took this abstract problem and made it concrete. I said no, that's not happening. And so, and that's part of the incorporation of the shadow. But then this regard, the shadow is actually benevolent, not malevolent. Well once it's incorporated. Yeah. Yeah, well that's the thing. And I don't know what to make of that in its entirety because it sort of means that if you, it means something like, because one of the old metaphysical problems is why would God allow evil into the world. I think well maybe God didn't allow evil into the world. Maybe God allowed the possibility of evil into the world. That's different. And maybe the world with the possibility of evil is actually a better world than the world without the possibility of evil. It's something like that. You know, in that maybe a man is better when he's a dangerous man who's being good than he would be if he was just a good man who wasn't capable of being dangerous. And I believe that because the best men that I've ever met are very dangerous men. You don't mess with them. So and you know that as soon as you meet them, do you think weak men can be virtuous? No. If you don't have the courage to commit a crime, it doesn't mean you're moral for not doing it. It just means you're afraid. You can see this I suppose to some degree in mob violence. People will riot because they don't think they'll get caught. And so they're not law abiding under normal circumstances because they're moral. They're law abiding because they're afraid of punishment. And so Nietzsche was very careful to distinguish mere obedience from morality. And he thought of obedience not always as a form of cowardice because it can also be a source of discipline, but not committing a crime because you're too afraid to. I mean, it's probably better than committing a crime, but it doesn't speak to the essence of morality. You know, and I've talked a fair bit about this is that there's a certain utility in being able to do virtually anything and then to control yourself. And that's something I learned in part from Nietzsche, I suppose. One of Nietzsche's most trenchant critiques of traditional morality, let's say, is that most of what passes for morality isn't morality. It's just cowardice. It's not that I'm a good person and I don't hurt you. It's that I'm afraid to hurt you. And because I don't want to admit that I'm afraid to hurt you, then I say I'm moral because then I could mask my essential fear and cowardice in a guise of morality. And that happens far more often than you would think because harmless and moral are by no means the same thing. So some of what you're burning off, you can sit and this is where Freud was such a genius, I think, is because he concentrated on aggression and sexuality, which are perhaps the two most difficult parts of a personality integrate, said that hyper-simplified morality stops you from tapping into deeper recesses of your psyche. And it's part of it because there are primal forces. It's not surprising that you don't want to have anything to do with them, that you stay away from situations where they might make themselves manifest. But the problem is by denying the worst in yourself, in that manner of suppressing it, you preclude the possibility of the best. Because no one can be a good person without integrating their capacity for aggression. Because without that capacity for aggression, you cannot say no. Because no means, if you really say it, no means there isn't anything that you can do to me that will make me change my mind or conversely it means I will play for higher stakes than you will. And unless you've got your aggression integrated, there isn't a chance you can say that. And if you did, no one would take you seriously because they'd know it was just a show. So one of the most useful things that Jung did, I think, was to work on this idea of the integration of the shadow, because he was really interested in the idea of evil, right? Especially working with trying to parcel out what happened in Nazi Germany and during the Second World War. What do you do with the part of you that's aggressive and potentially malevolent? You just crush it? That's the super-ego response in some sense. You just put it behind you, so to speak? Is that a possibility? Or do you admit to its existence and bring it into the game? And that's, see, for Freud in some sense, morality was super-ego clamping down on the id and they were fundamentally opposed. Both Jung and Piaget had a different idea and I think they were right. It's like, no, no, you invite the bad guys out to play. And so you're an aggressive hockey player. But it's discipline-degression. That makes you, gives you access to a whole sorts of energy you wouldn't otherwise have. And then with regards to sexuality, it's like, well, untrammeled promiscuity doesn't constitute a virtue. But neither does unavoidable virginity, right? In fact, I think that's worse, because it also masks itself with virtue. It's like, well, you should be able to do things that you wouldn't do. It's like the definition of a genuinely moral person.
