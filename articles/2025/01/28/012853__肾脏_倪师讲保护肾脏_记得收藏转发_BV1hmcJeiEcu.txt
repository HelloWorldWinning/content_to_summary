Description:
**Summary Outline:**

1.  **The Analogy of "Saint" (圣) and "Skin" (皮):**
    *   The "saint" represents a system that stores "nourishment" (养), analogous to water.
    *   The "skin" represents the system that controls and retains this nourishment, analogous to earth.
    *   Normal people's earth ("skin") controls water ("saint"), preventing it from overflowing.

2.  **Traditional Understanding vs. Deeper Understanding:**
    *   Traditional view: If there's an issue with water accumulation, you need to "drain" it by working on the skin/surface.
    *   Deeper understanding: The "saint" already has nourishment within, which needs to be contained and controlled by "skin"

3.  **The Role of Nourishment (养):**
    *   Nourishment provides energy, strength, wisdom, and memory.
    *   Nourishment needs to be retained within the "saint," and this is achieved by the "skin."

4.  **The Relationship of Skin and Water (皮自水):**
     *   The skin controls and holds the water, allowing it to be contained.
    *   Improper functioning of skin leads to the inability to hold on to the nourishment.

5.  **The Concept of "Opening the River":**
    *   A healthy system (where nourishment is controlled by skin) allows for a controlled release of nourishment ("opening the river") when needed
    *   A lack of controlled nourishment containment leads to "uncontrollable" flow ("河开了").

6.  **Traditional Chinese Medicine and "Solidifying the Essence":**
    *   Some traditional therapies focus on using herbs to solidify essence and prevent loss, but may not address the root problem.
    *    The core approach should focus on strengthening skin to manage the water/nourishment effectively.

7. **Core Concept in Jing Fang:**
    *  Jing Fang rarely relies on traditional herbs because it focuses on the fundamental relationship between skin and water, highlighting the importance of *skin's* ability to manage fluid, therefore manage the nourishment.

**Core Point:**

The core point is that the system needs strong “skin” to control and hold its “nourishment”, otherwise the nourishing content will be uncontrollably released.

**Fundamental Point:**

The fundamental point is that the balance and management of “nourishment” (like water) depends on the proper functioning of the system’s “skin” (like earth), which governs its containment.

**Overarching Framework:**

The overarching framework is a physiological analogy comparing the human body to a system where nourishment (water) needs to be contained by a regulating system (skin/earth), and issues arise when this system fails to contain and manage the nourishment properly. It advocates for a focus on strengthening the “skin” system rather than simply trying to drain or "solidify" the nourishment itself.
