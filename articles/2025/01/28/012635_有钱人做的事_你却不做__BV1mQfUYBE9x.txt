Content:
 Also, when I meet poor people, they don't respect property. They think property is property. So they live in cheap houses or drive cheap cars or wear cheap clothes or cheap shoes. Never mentioned, never wear cheap shoes. But anyway, so I'm gonna talk about my friend Josh here. So Josh popped into the video here. Tell us what happened here. So this is Josh. He's the guy behind the camera. And I'm glad he has the courage. He's a very good young man, strong young man. Talk about lesson you just learned on property. Kenny McElroy, he gave me the coolest car ever that he had bought from you, Robert, which was a 1957 Porsche Speedster. And it was the coolest car ever. And so he gave it to me last January as my daily driver as to what I was driving to to and from work and anywhere that I was going. And in June, I left Arizona to go to Columbia, but I took the car and I gave it back to Ken. And what happened was the wheels were messed up. There was a mirror issue. Mirror was broken. The mirror was broken. And so I didn't take care of the car or respect it to the degree that I ever should have and it was incredibly irresponsible. It's a very light car. When Ken is in the tires or burned out, that means you were jamming the transmission. Those are expensive cars. So anyway, I was saying to Josh, my car, I have one car in here that's $400,000. It's property. Now do I need a $400,000 car? No, was I explaining that other videos? How do I buy a $400,000 car without me paying for it? My answer's by the car. But I take care of my property. I mean, he's very courageous, very brave to come up here. So I want to talk about mistakes and how we learn. That's the most important thing. So what have you learned so far? What was really eye-opening to me was when you told me that the poor people don't respect property. And he said, Josh, you don't respect what you have. You're just a stupid rich kid who doesn't respect what you have. And you'll never be rich if you don't learn how to respect what you have. Property. Property. You'll say, oh, what difference does it make if my watch isn't $50,000? Makes all the difference up here because that means your poor appear. Not here. And I almost say to Josh, is that one of the best lessons I ever learned, we learned from our mistakes. And the reason human beings are different than animals, we have the ability to learn from our mistakes. And the reason our school system is screwed up and school teachers such poor people is in the school system. They think you make mistakes means you're stupid. Don't listen to you're stupid. It's because you make a mistake and don't learn from it. You wasted a good mistake. Now I'll give you an example. I said, you know, Porsche, it's expensive mistake. But when I was in the US Marine Corps flying helicopter gunships, I was court martial twice. Not just once, but twice. So I say to all the young men out there, join the Marine Corps. If you really want to understand how to become a man, join the Marine Corps Navy SEALs because they're tough as frickin' ails. My friend who is a three star general now a congressman is a big dog. He says they can't find men today. It's really a pain for this. Lots of women volunteering for the armed services. But the men aren't showing up. I think 70% don't qualify who show up. And the men are effeminate, they're not strong and they're like TikTok dancers. The first time I got the court martial was out of Hong Kong. You have a carrier, then you have support physicals, those choirs and frickets around you. And the carrier pulls into Hong Kong and we go to this huge party with the Indians from India, the GRCA party. So what this GRCA party dancing and having a good time, it was a fun evening and I had this hot, hot, hot girl from Tahiti with me. Oh, she was the hottest. Oh, I don't love Tahitian women. Anyway, so I'm at this party. My friend who is the three star general today, Marines take care of him, he's a fellow pilot. He says, get out of here now. Said, why? He says, get out of here now. We're pulling out. He says, take her with you. Get out of here now. So here is this fantastic party on this hill in Hong Kong. So I grabbed a little hot Tahitian check. We run and I lived on American Express for a while, but what happened was what else being warned of, the whole squadron, the battle group of carriers, they're driving to Vietnam that night. I miss the ship. And so for three weeks, I was in Hong Kong living on American Express. I had to buy all my teal-er made clothes and living like a king with a little hot Tahitian check. And I get back to the squadron. And as to remember the helicopter drops me off. I knew I was going to have to make an entrance because I was going to get cart-martial. So when I was in Hong Kong, I had a whole outfit made of a purple. I had a purple shirt, purple pants and purple shoes. And I stepped off the helicopter on the carrier and all the guys were cheering me. I was going, hand cuffs straight. I said, yeah, I did it, I did it. And so the trial goes, you know, and I sat there and this guy hated me. My commanding officer just, I hated him, he hated me. He says, no, no, no, no, you be charged for basically missing a movement or AWOL. Absent without leave, cart-martial offense. I says, one thing wrong, Colonel. He goes, what? He didn't give me notice. He says, what? He didn't know this. I went to military school to an academy. Trump went to an academy also, military school. But I went to a school that taught me admolte law. The law says he must give a sailor 24-hour notice before sailing. So if you're going to sail, let's say 12 noon, but you change it to something, I noticed that's like about 24 hours. Colonel, there was no 24 hour notice. The board wasn't posted. He goes, what does that mean? I called the prosecuting attorney. I said, read to him the law on this here. He says, it was Colonel, he's correct. We did not post the sailing time. We sailed early. So he didn't miss the ship. The ship left him, some line. And this Colonel hates me even more now. And you should talk to my friend, Congressman Jack Bergman, three star general and all this. It was tense in that room, man, like this. And so the guy says, leave. Oh, fuck you. So I left. This was the problem. I didn't get the lesson. The lesson was I lied. I knew we were leaving. But the worst thing about it was I got cocky. Once I could get away with that lesson, I was going to try another one. So two years later, I'm flying out of Hawaii now, Marine Corps Air Station, Hawaii. This was during the Vietnam War. Our Marines had shaved heads. We couldn't, it was hard to pick up checks, you know, wacky key. That was my excuse. The way we'd pick up checks, tourist checks, is we'd walk up to them and say, hey, you want to go for helicopter ride? And they all said yes. So we used to pick them up on this deserted flight. I fly from the Marine Station to this barren air feel. And these checks would jump into the helicopter. And we'd fly to this deserted island called Kahlolavi. And we had beer and guns and shooting. And we're always going for the mile high clubs. See, we got to get laid up in the sky. They're having the best of time drunk as a skunk. But that's what happened when they didn't catch me the first time. So the second time I did a beer. Right, you know what I mean? So I come taxiing in and I dropped the beautiful young tourist checks off. I come taxiing in and this. As soon as I turned off the throttle, not that you need it. But once you crack that throttle, you can't start it again for about three hours. So as soon as I went, the guys came up, they opened the door. And the first thing they fell out were beer cans. The second thing they fell out was me. Then they looked in the back, they found a dead deer, which I shot on the way back from the helicopter. And I had scuba gear, diving gear. And that's what got me up to altitude. It's like a bomb going off up there. So now, again, I was back in handcuffs. I'm locked up. I'm going to court Marshall for the second time. And I was sitting there, we went to contemplate my life. And I said, what am I learning here? And I did a thing back then, was called S-E-S-T. Air heart seminars, training today is called Life-Spinning or something like that. Personal Development Seminar. So I took that seminar and I went, oh my God. And I got the lessons, you know, I'm a liar. I'm a cheat. I'm a scumbag. They're proceeding on the, they're finding all the documents. I had lied so many times that they found so much evidence against me. It was tax and evidence. Flying this, doing that. I was stealing from the warehouse, like a big Walmart. I understood how to take the whole system. I was a complete criminal. When I realized I was a complete criminal because I was smart, because I could get away with it. I was going, oh my God. So I still remember I was under house arrest. I called up Captain Abrams, the prosecutor. Tough Jewish guy. I said, Captain, I'm coming in. He goes, what? So I'm turning myself in. He goes, what? So I'm turning myself in. I drove from Waikiki all across the island to the main air station, sat down, deposition. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, the truth, the truth. I said, yes, sir. So in this day that you do this, yes, sir. Under, did you do this? Did you steal? Did you do this? Were you flying women naked? Were you having sex in the sky? Yes. Were you drunk? Yes. Were you shooting animals out of your helicopter? Yes. Could you have scuba gear? Yes. I said, there, I lost 20 pounds. Is there anything else with Tedette's? No, sir. Congratulations. Thank you for telling the truth. So as we're packaging it up, still in the courtroom on the base, I said, Captain, how many years will I go to jail? He looked at me and says, but Tedette, you're free. You'll have an honorable discharge in six months. I said, what? An honorable discharge. Yup. But, but, but, but, take it, Lieutenant. Thank you for telling the truth. Or not after you. Or after your commanding officer. Your commanding officer is a bigger crook than you are. And I didn't know that. Well, then, you know, it's a colonel. So I drove off that base, and that's when it was the truth. She'll set you free. So ever since then, I've been a stickler, not the law. If I make a mistake, I admit it right away. If it caused me money, I'll pay the money. Also, when I got married, I never cheated on Kim. Never. I would never cheat on my wife. A lot of guys cheat. I said, not going to do that. So that's why I have a tremendous love and respect for the Marine Corps. Because there's a lot of, you know, from the Lord's Prayer, that will be religious, lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. The best way to do it is you fuck up on it, tell the truth, get the lesson, pay the price, move on. But a lot of people are trying to pretend, you know, like Bill Clinton, our president, he never had sex with Monica Lewinsky, because he wanted to define what sex is. To him, a shit job is not sex. I'm going, I'll give you a break. But anyway, that's why he was president. Now, I just choose to live my life. The truth is such a free, you make a mistake, it's the best thing you can do. Because a mistake is something you learn from. And I've made lots of mistakes, money-wise, financial-wise, relationships-wise, but the mistakes are how we learn. And I'll say it again. The reason most school teachers are poor is because they teach students don't make mistakes. Thank you. Thank you.
