Description:
Okay, here's the summary of the provided text, structured and outlined as requested:

**Summary:**

1.  **Four Scenarios of NBD (Narcissistic Behavioral Disorder) Discarding:**
    *   **High-Value Target:** The NBD finds and pursues a higher-value source of attention and validation, making them too occupied to return.
    *   **Ego Shattered:** The NBD's narcissism is severely wounded by the breakup ( public humiliation and exposure of the false persona), leading to them avoiding contact as a form of punishment.
    *   **Avoidant/Nurse Type:** This type of NBD focuses on their own interests, neglecting their partners and rarely engaging with them, including after a breakup. They might passively express nostalgia but are fundamentally indifferent.
    *   **Perceived Strength:** If the NBD senses their target has become too strong and aware, no longer a source for exploitation, they will discard them, as they can no longer extract benefit.

2.  **The Puzzle of "Hoovering" (回吸) and Attachment:**
    *   **"Hoovering" Explained:** The desire for an NBD to return (回吸), it's tied to one's self-worth and the breakdown in one's self-assessment.
    *   **Value System Breakdown:** "Hoovering" occurs when a person loses sight of their own value system or has never held strong self-worth, or in fact, their self-worth is defined by how much the narcissist values them. The cycle also stems from a traumatic bond and a maladaptive pattern with the NBD.
    *   **"Hoovering" is Not Validation:** A person's value is not determined by whether or not an NBD returns (回吸) as the narcissist's perception isn't an accurate reflection of one's true worth.

**Core Point:**
The reasons an NBD might discard you completely range from securing a better supply of validation to avoiding confrontation with their damaged ego or being indifferent, all the while the desire for an NBD to return to you is based on a distorted value system.

**Fundamental Point:**
Your self-worth is independent of an NBD’s actions, specifically whether they choose to "hoover" or not.

**Overarching Framework:**
The content explores the various reasons why a narcissistic individual might completely discard someone and the resulting struggle of the target to understand their own attachment to the narcissist. It emphasizes the importance of separating one's value from the narcissist's actions.
