好的，下面是对内容的总结：

**1. 主要观点概要:**

   *   **失败率高：** 大约三分之二的创业公司会在10年内倒闭。
   *   **关键在于客户选择：**  许多企业失败不是因为自身的问题，而是因为选择了不稳定的客户。
   *   **结构性流失 (Structural Churn):**  某些市场，如小型企业市场，本身就存在很高的流失率，这与产品或服务无关。
   *   **重视选择：**  如同NBA选秀，企业在选择客户时就决定了成败，客户也是生态系统的一部分。
   *   **大型客户的价值：** 顶级的广告公司服务于大型客户，因为小型客户本身就很不稳定。

**2. 核心结论 (Core Point):**

   The success of a business is heavily influenced by the type of customers it chooses to serve, and focusing on smaller, more volatile clients often leads to failure due to structural churn.

**3. 基本结论 (Fundamental Point):**

 Two out of three businesses fail. And so that means within 10 years, if we were to look back at these business owners, two out of three are out of the game. Every business that I've started since 2016 still continues to make money to this day. So here's how to make your business unstoppable. There's three steps. It starts with stop selling small customers. Your business may fail, not because you are a failure, but maybe because the customers you serve are failures. Let me tell you a story to explain this. So there was a small gym CRM back in the day that approached me about investing. I asked them what their churn was. So what percentage of customers were leaving between last month and this month? And their answer surprised me. It was a much higher percentage than I expected because I thought a CRM, their processing, their payments, their hear, they have all their memberships, and they're like, this should be a very sticky product. And I said, so where is the churn coming from? And they said, oh, well, about a third of the gyms go out of business every year. And I was like, wow, wait a second. So this has nothing to do with how good your product or service was. These businesses in and of themselves just stopped being in business. The formal language for that is called structural churn. It means it's like it's based, it's baked into the structure of the market that you serve. Now the question is, is that your choice to pursue that market? And the answer is yes. A lot of business owners struggle on the business and they look at everything, except for the most important thing, which is they, they messed up the pick. Chick-fil-A's head of people gives a great example of this. When they talk about actually talent selection, but I think the parallel holds. They said, most people lose in the NBA, in the championships, and wonder what they did wrong in the game when in reality they lost in the draft, as in they didn't have the right people in the team. And so if you think about your business as an ecosystem, the right people in the team has to be all the stakeholders, including the customers. And so if you're thinking about your own business, there are many business models that simply aren't fit for smaller customers. And so I'll give you a different example. In the agency world, where you do some sort of advertising for any type of business, if you look at some of the biggest ad agencies in the world, you'll notice a common theme. They all serve the biggest customers in the world. Whereas if it were true that agencies would be best served serving small customers, then some of the biggest agencies would serve some of the smallest customers. But that's not reality. In looking at this, it means that just like the CRM business, and that's arguably one of the stickiest businesses you could possibly imagine, the agencies could not keep churned down with small business owners, because small business owners in and of themselves are volatile. Let me give you a visual. So let's imagine this is kind of representing the ebbs and flows of the revenue of a small business. Now, let's say they decide to work with you here. They say, you know what, we're going to sign up with you and you get paid. Now, maybe you start advertising the business and then the next month, they make a little bit more money. Hooray. Everyone's happy. Now, the next month, the normal volatility occurs, or maybe because you sent them more customers, then they could handle, they say, hey, maybe we need to ease off a little bit. And all of a sudden, they think to themselves, wait a second.
