Description:
Okay, here's a summary of the provided text, following your specified requirements:

**I. Summary Outline:**

*   **A. The Rise of Grievance Politics:**
    *   Donald Trump's presidency amplified the expression of grievances, anger, and resentment, moving them from the margins to the forefront of public discourse.
    *   This is fueled by a sense of humiliation among those who feel "left behind" and "looked down upon," particularly by well-educated elites.
    *   This politics of anger lacks mutual recognition of the value of different contributions to society.
*   **B. Market Values vs. Moral Values:**
    *   A discussion about a 17-year-old selling a kidney for an iPad and iPhone highlights differing views on the role of markets and individual choice vs. respect for human life.
    *   Initial pro-market views, particularly among young people in China in the 2000s, reflected the freedom and economic growth associated with market reforms, yet a search for meaning beyond the market also existed.
    *   This search for meaning indicates that markets and technology cannot define human purposes and ends. Over-reliance on them as a faith leads to disappointment.
*   **C. Combining Markets with Meaning:**
    *   The need to combine market benefits with sources of meaning, liberation, dialogue, and reflection to serve higher human purposes is emphasized.
    *   A shift away from a focus solely on meritocratic competition toward addressing inequalities of income, honor, and recognition is crucial, emphasizing the dignity of work and a broader understanding of valuable societal contributions.
    *   Class mixing institutions are needed to overcome social divisions and polarization.
*  **D. The Dangers of Singular Truths**
    * The most dangerous idea today is the belief that there is only one interpretation of our past, of religious and spiritual traditions, or only one destiny.
    * This singular truth leads to dangerous politics.
    * Extreme version of Silicon Valley techno-utopianism, such as transhumanism, also embraces singular truths, believing that their vision of the future is inevitable.
*  **E. Navigating the Virtual World:**
    *   Philosophy should focus on asking critical questions, persuading people to question the merging of virtual and real worlds, especially in the context of AI.
    *   The deepest threat of AI is confusing virtual connections with real relationships which would be a loss.
    *   A discussion arises on AI-equipped companions for lonely individuals and the issue of acceptance, which blurs lines between robotic and real interactions.
    *   This leads to discussions on virtual immortality, and whether it will reduce or eliminate the experience of grieving.
*   **F.  Philosophy and its Responsibility**
    *  Philosophy should be aware of its historical consequences and be responsible for them.
    * Philosophers must recognize that how others implement philosophical ideas can lead to unexpected and dangerous consequences, both positively and negatively.
    * The spirit of questioning is important.

**II. Core Point:**

The core point is that over-reliance on markets and technology for defining human purpose can lead to a dangerous neglect of deeper moral, social, and communal values, necessitating a re-evaluation of what it means to lead meaningful lives in our increasingly complex world.

**III. Fundamental Point:**

The fundamental point is that while markets and technology are useful tools, they should be guided by a philosophical understanding of human needs, values, and the need for genuine connection, and not be allowed to dictate purpose or displace human interaction and reflection.

**IV. Overarching Framework:**

The overarching framework is a critical examination of the tension between market-driven values and humanistic ideals. The discussion spans politics, economics, technology, philosophy, and interpersonal relationships to explore the nature of meaning, connection, and responsibility in a rapidly changing world, advocating for a balanced approach that incorporates technological advancements while upholding core human values.

 became elevated with the presidency of Donald Trump. We've struggled more directly and more conspicuously, more frontally with the dark side, finding public expression on the stage, on the stage, public expression, rather than kept at the margins and at the periphery. And finding a voice in the media and in social media, especially. And in a now in a presidential campaign that will be a rematch of the one from last time. We've seen as a backlash against elites, especially against well-educated elites, professional elites. Donald Trump has been very effective at tapping into the grievances of people who feel they've been left behind and looked down upon. Humiliation, the politics of humiliation. And it's this sense of humiliation, I think, that opened the way for the politics of grievance that Donald Trump has been able to exploit. In the United States today, and in many parts of the world, is a politics of anger, resentment, and grievance without mutual recognition. Without recognizing the value of the contributions that people make from different walks of life, we will not really begin to address the resentments that now afflict our politics and have accentuated some of the darkest strands in social life. I invite you to offer your views about an incident, a story that I read about, where a 17-year-old boy sold his kidney. You all know the story. He bought an iPad and an iPhone. But how many think it's OK? It's a pre-market, and there's nothing wrong with it. Because I study economics, and I think every adult is an economic man that he has to be responsible for his behaviors, he clearly know the consequence of losing one kidney. We should give him the chance to take that risk. He choose for himself. A lot of people agree with that. All right, that's very good. So I would like to hear from those who object. Yes. And stand up. Well, I think it's wrong, because give your kidney to others. Maybe you feel it's OK, but in fact, for the respect of a person, it is not respect of life. OK, that's very interesting. Even facing the same concept, like just this. Yeah. You see the difference between them from different countries? Yes. Yeah. It prompted me to reflect on why there are these differences when I encountered them. When I had these conversations with young people in China in the 2000s, what struck me was that I was first they did have very strong pro-market moral intuitions, as I mentioned. And I would put a lot of examples to students and to the audience, asking them whether they think this or that social practice should be governed by money or by other norms. So I put questions like this. What struck me was the moral intuitions about buying and selling were similar in the US and China. In Eastern Europe, it was similar in Poland, for example. Most European countries, it was quite different. You think why? Why? Similar. I think it's because, especially in the early 2000s, that China had experienced the young generation had grown up with the market reforms. And it had been a period of tremendous economic growth. It's kind of freedom for them. It was an expression of freedom and rising affluence, but especially of freedom. But at the same time, they were looking for meaning that markets could not provide. And so the search for meaning persisted even after the market triumphalist moment. And I think that one of the reasons that people were drawn to the Justice book was the sense that there are moral meanings that lie beyond markets and beyond economics. What do you think? We're facing two choices or different choices. We can't choose the best one. They're no best one. Just less evil. Just less evil, what, maybe? But I wouldn't regard these as closed alternatives. I would ask a different question. How is it possible to combine the benefits of market arrangements and technological innovations with sources of meaning, the liberation dialogue, reflection that can answer to higher human purposes and ends? Our mistake is not to use markets to organize economic activities. Our mistake is not to hope that technological innovations will deliver real improvements to the way we live our lives. Our mistake is the tendency to think that markets and technology by themselves can define human purposes and ends. They can't. And when we put too much faith in them, when they become a kind of faith, almost a kind of religious faith, markets and technology, then we're bound to be disappointed. And when the disappointment comes, the disappointment may take harsh, dangerous forms. So the situation is so complicated, what kind of solution we come for a while? We try to put dialogue. But very difficult. I think we need to focus less on arming people for a meritocratic competition and focus more on contending with inequalities of income and wealth, but also inequalities of honor, recognition, and esteem. And this means we have to renew the dignity of work. We have to broaden our conception about what counts as a valuable contribution to the common good. And we need the kind of class mixing institutions in civil society that will lead us to encounter one another, to be in one another's presence, not only in our phone, all the more so when our societies are divided and polarized because the people we encounter tend to be people only like ourselves. We need to overcome that. Mm-hmm. But every solution, every serial, always has its own floor. Yeah. So how about your solution? Your attack meritoric chrisi. But maybe your serial, your book, still has kind of flawed. Maybe you must overcome what kind of flaw it is. Right. Well, what applies to you identified? Let's start with that. I don't know, maybe too idealistic. Yeah. You think so? I don't know. What I've just suggested is really too much to hope for. Mm-hmm. I don't think that reducing inequality and renewing the dignity of work and creating a greater equality of condition and recognition will happen anytime soon. They're not easy projects to undertake. So I want to be realistic about that. But I think, do you think, should the philosophy be more responsible for the historical consequence or not? Idea and reality? Rosal, hago. Yeah. They talk about equality, talk about the virtue. But the consequence may be this one. Yes. Extreme opposite. Yes. How do you see the paradox? If one thinks, and I, as I do, that philosophy is always situated in the world, that philosophy should attend to the world, then philosophy cannot be indifferent and the philosopher cannot be indifferent to the way in which various people or parties or movements implement philosophical ideas. So there's always an interplay between political practice and the philosophical ideas that inform it. And often they can go off the rails. They can go in very dark directions. That the philosopher may never have wanted or anticipated. That's always a danger. That's one of the persisting dangers of philosophy. The part of Hegel that has led political practice, astray, in wrong direction, that teaches that history has a single ultimate destination and that it takes a certain shape that has contributed to some of the dangerous movements in history who may have been inspired by the idea that history points in a certain direction and that it's our responsibility, either to let history unfold or to help history unfold, to reach that final destination once and for all. I think the phrase or the idea once and for all is a deeply dangerous idea and I think it's at odds with the philosophical spirit of questioning, contesting, offering, competing interpretations. In your mind, in our time, which idea is the most dangerous idea? In today's award, I would say that the forces today that are most dangerous are the versions of religious fundamentalism or of hyper-nationalism or of ideological purity that all draw in one way or another on the idea that moral truths and human truths are singular, that there's only one way of interpreting our past, there's only one historical end or destination, there's only one true way of interpreting religious and spiritual traditions because what this misses? Well, it leads to dangerous politics, but it also misses the deep pluralism of the human experience. So, how about the Silicon Valley philosophy? Is techno driven ideology? I would say it's a version of this because the most extreme versions of Silicon Valley techno utopianism, some have a more specific term of transhumanism or singularity, because they too think that history is on their side, they too think that as technology develops and as generative AI develops, we will be transcending the messy, contentious, pluralist human projects and arriving at a kind of singularity, where perhaps our minds will meld with machines, and the very idea that going to the Moon or to Mars is kind of a natural outgrowth of this way of thinking, where they can start anew, it's the ambition really to start from scratch, with a clean slate to begin anew, unfettered, uncomplicated by disagreement, contestation, challenge, dialogue, controversy, where they can start anew and build a society from scratch, that is not as they might see it, weighted down by the controversies that arise whenever human beings gather in a society. So, there is something, it's fantastical, but it's also dangerous and hubristic because it implies that they are the avatars, they are the pioneers, the initiators of this new frontier that breaks free from the messy need to negotiate, to discuss, to disagree, which is essential to the human experience. Mmm. Wow, that's a good idea. It's a good idea. It's a good idea. It's a good idea. I'm not sure if you can see it. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. You can't lose it. I do think the only three points are for me. Wouldgis explain it, as he mentioned, that I've done all the things I've seen for years, but it still has to be close. I think we're talking about a little bit further about it during the holidays, you And you should Vale write to my family for you but for us doing like filing feat so what's the problem is I'll try and you soon I'm so excited that it helps with his concentration with his young grandma. He's so thankful with the gentleman. But I'm glad to see him using this function. That's why he is always cores, although many of his life's kind. Some amazing language, and he later asked a good question. and the city So could you marry maybe in the coming years? Everyone has that here to amigraine into the metaverse. What should philosophy do, think or do in that new era? Take the god of the song. Yeah, that's a philosophy. Should you take the god of the song? Yes, so it would be the mission of philosophy in a metaverse if it ever came to be. Would be to try to persuade people to take those goggles off. To imagine a world in which the line between what's virtual and what's real. Yeah, blurs to the point of vanishing. And here's the question, would such a world be recognizable as a human world? A world in which we had lost even, well we no longer cared even to ask the question. How to locate the line between the virtual and the real. And I think the deepest threat in human terms posed by the age of AI is that we will confuse virtual community and connection with the real thing. And that would represent the real loss. How to fight with the trend or deal with the trend. It seems unstoppable. You think it seems unstoppable? It seems, yeah. Well it's worth asking, figuring out how to stop it, it's worth asking why it seems unstoppable. Why do you think? Because two less true debate and the discussion about it. Most people just follow the trend. Right. But if I could feel and believe the connection I have through my phone, scrolling and swiping and texting and posting, that that connection to people half a world away is the same as as valuable as my personal connections to family, friends, neighbors, classmates. What would you say to them? I don't know. I would that represent a loss I guess. Why would that represent a loss? I'm curious about you. My phone. It's the most intimate things we have. We touch and we are very intimate. There's more time with AIDS. Yeah. And through the social media you talk with so many people. I think sometimes, even most times, just from different places, we're so rich, but still feel very intimate. The similar was made. Your face-to-face. Right. So it's a new community. But I'm not so sure about it's less important than the more concrete community before or the similar. I'm so confused about it. We also how to understand it, the change. Yeah. Yeah. Well, let me ask you this question. We're talking about intimacy. Intimacy is an important aspect of this. There are now AI-equipped devices, little robots, that you can buy, let's say you have an aged parent or grandparent who's living alone, maybe in a nursing home. And who's lonely? And you'll visit them from time to time, but you can't be there every day. You can buy one of these robotic companions. And the robotic companion will carry on a conversation with your loved one, your grandmother, let's say. And let's suppose that your grandmother comes to regard that robotic AI-driven companion as a friend, as an actual friend, sharing intimacies, asking advice. And suppose that this relieves the loneliness of your grandmother and makes her happier. She considers this her friend. Would that bother you or would you welcome that? Well, come. You would welcome that. It doesn't bother you at all. Maybe no, I told, maybe a little, but I accepted. You would accept it. But what's the little? The bother. Maybe just because it's a new thing and needs sometimes and space to understand it, accept it. But if you are grand, this goes back to what we were discussing about, the virtual and the actual. Now, your grandmother no longer recognizes, we're assuming, the difference between a robotic friend and an actual friend. That doesn't bother you. Do you think there's a loss? I think the new friend, the toy, is friend of her. Because some books are for friends, even it's just papers. Ah, books. Yeah. So if the grandmother or a few or I were absorbed in a book. Even we see some old books, it's like friends. Yeah, it's spent many, maybe a couple years with you. And, well, I agree that a book can be a friend. And a source of, I would say, genuine companionship. But does it matter that when I'm reading a book and absorbed in a book, I'm engaged in a kind of exchange with, a kind of dialogue with the human author of that book. Whereas when your grandmother is spending her day conversing with the robot, she isn't. We talk about soccer, play it home. It's 2,000 years ago. Still can be your friend. So why not the toy? Why not the toy? But because it's a machine. Yeah. Can it engage in dialogue? We've been talking a lot about dialogue. Or put it this way. When take a simple example, when we've, maybe the toy speaks like a sock rate. So many information about sock rate in the toy. Like a chat bot. A Socratic chat bot. Yeah. We can imagine sock rates from the books, from his dialogue. Yeah. So maybe she can imagine something similar from the toy. Yes. The toy is like different books. Because the books is much more sophisticated than we think. Even a book. It's more different layers. Maybe we just can't touch it. Maybe several layers. But more layers which still can't touch. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe if the toy has, it becomes a sophisticated chat bot that is programmed on Socrates or Dostoevsky. Yeah. Well let me ask you this. Suppose your grandmother passes away. But she has left all of her digital data, all of her emails, all of her social media recording of her experiences. And created a digital avatar using machine learning. So that you, you're mourning the loss of your loved one. But you can still carry on conversations with her. And so can your children. And so can their children. But their great, great grandmother. And ask her advice. Can introduce her to a new boyfriend or girlfriend. Ask her opinion. Now in principle, machine learning AI generated chat bots as they become perfected. Could provide a kind of virtual immortality. In which case the line that's being blurred is not only between the virtual and the actual but between living and not living. What about that? Would you want to speak to the virtual digital avatar of your great grandmother? Maybe I, maybe I will I guess. Because in those days we see pictures of them. Yeah. Their letters. Read their letters. Yeah. And remember them. Yeah. It's still a cannot dialogue. With the photo. With the letters. Yeah. It is a kind of dialogue. It has become a new, complicated and the more rich photo and letters. Yeah. So virtual immortality, you would welcome virtual immortality. I don't know. Actually I don't know. I think I will. It's like maybe in the, still about books, the bookshelf. Yeah. Around you. You can see different names. Yeah. Yeah. The robot. The virtual reality. Maybe it's kind of new thing of the black books. It's called my grandparents. Yeah. Friends. But in that case, would you no longer, would we no longer grieve or feel sad when someone dies, a loved one dies?
