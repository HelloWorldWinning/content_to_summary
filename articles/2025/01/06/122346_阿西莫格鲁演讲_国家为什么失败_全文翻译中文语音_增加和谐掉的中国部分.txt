Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Introduction and Core Argument:**

*   **Background:** This presentation stems from 16 years of research culminating in a book co-authored by the speaker and James, examining long-term economic development trends.
*   **Central Observation:**  The world has seen vast economic disparities emerge over the past 500 years, with some regions dramatically outpacing others. This disparity cannot be solely explained by physical capital, human capital, or technological change.
*   **Critique of Existing Theories:**
    *   **Geography:**  While factors like climate and resources play a role, they don't fully explain the huge income differences.
    *   **Culture/Religion:** Though values and attitudes can matter, they don't provide a complete explanation for economic divergence.
    *   **Ignorance Hypothesis (Policy):**  While bad policy is a factor, it doesn't explain why leaders choose bad policies in the first place.

**II.  Proposed Framework: Inclusive vs. Extractive Institutions**

*   **Inclusive Economic Institutions:** These institutions provide secure property rights, open markets with no barriers to entry, equal opportunities for participation, and support for innovation. They are foundational for sustained growth and widespread prosperity. They also include an underlying legal system to enforce contracts.
*   **Extractive Economic Institutions:** These are the polar opposite; they feature insecure property rights, barriers to entry, regulations that hinder markets, uneven playing fields, and benefit elites at the expense of others.  They are designed to extract resources and wealth from the majority of society.
*   **Extractive Political Institutions:** These systems concentrate political power in the hands of a few, allowing them to manipulate economic systems to their advantage. Power is not constrained or supervised.
*   **Inclusive Political Institutions:** These systems distribute power broadly, ensure inclusivity, and foster political accountability. No society perfectly embodies an ideal system but it provides a good point of comparison.
*   **Mutual Reinforcement:** Inclusive political and economic institutions mutually support each other, creating a positive feedback loop that fosters growth and prosperity, and also extractive political and economic institutions.

**III. Historical Examples**

*   **Barbados (Extractive):** The example of slavery in Barbados highlights extractive institutions: insecure property rights for slaves, no incentives for productivity, and a small elite controlling political and economic power, all maintained by military coercion.
*   **Argentina (Initial Extractive Failure):**  Spanish colonizers initially failed in Argentina because they encountered dispersed, non-hierarchical Indian tribes they couldn't easily exploit.
*   **Paraguay (Extractive):**  In contrast, the Spanish successfully exploited hierarchical Guarani society to establish extractive institutions.
*   **Jamestown, Virginia (Transition to Inclusiveness):**  The Virginia Company initially attempted extractive practices with indentured servants, but this failed. Forced to innovate, they established private property rights and a parliament, laying the foundation for inclusive institutions in the US. The absence of native hierarchies pushed the US toward inclusive institutions.
*   **Mexico (Extractive Growth):**  While Mexico experienced economic growth under Porfirio Díaz, it was based on monopolies and did not foster innovation. This "extractive growth" was unstable and led to the Mexican Revolution.

**IV.  Key Concepts and Extensions**

*   **Creative Destruction:**  Economic growth requires innovation and the replacement of old systems and technologies with new ones (as highlighted by Schumpeter). Extractive political institutions fear the creative destruction that is required for sustained economic growth.
*   **Reversal of Fortune:**  The poorest areas in the world, after colonization became the richest due to institutional changes.
*   **Extractive Growth:** Growth under extractive institutions is typically unstable, short-lived, and often leads to further inequity. It's often based on monopolies and forced labor, it will ultimately contain the seeds of its own destruction.
*   **Fear of Creative Destruction:** Predatory political systems fear creative destruction because it might undermine their power.
*   **Path Dependency and Institutional Drift:** Small differences in historical contexts can lead to significant institutional divergence over time.
*   **Middle-Income Institutional Trap:** Societies can get stuck with a mix of both inclusive and extractive institutions, preventing them from achieving full economic potential.

**V. Conclusion:**

*   **Core Point:**  The presence of inclusive economic and political institutions is the key driver for long-term, sustained, and inclusive economic growth.
*   **Fundamental Point:**  Economic success is not predetermined by geography, culture, or leadership; it is fundamentally determined by the interplay between inclusive or extractive political and economic institutions.
*   **Overarching Framework:** The framework is a theory of long term economic growth based on the interplay of political and economic institutions. The theory contrasts extractive and inclusive institutions and explains their respective impacts on economic growth, while also providing historical evidence and examples to show how these institutions come into being, and how they are linked to the path of each society.

Content:
First of all, I'm so happy to be here. Thank you for your invitation. Given that remote communication is not easy, I decided to briefly outline the arguments that appear in the book that James and I co-authored. In fact, this book is the culmination of about 16 years of research that James and I have been doing. I think it's fair to say that a lot of economic development and economic growth has been driven by the patterns reported in this book. In particular, this is data from Angus Maddison's life's work, and while it's not entirely uncontroversial, the overall pattern is relatively uncontroversial.  The patterns we observe actually provide the context for many attempts to understand long-term trends in economic development. I think these patterns also show that it's difficult to understand why some regions - places that were once comparable to Asia, especially the Indian subcontinent and China - have seen huge increases in per capita income and prosperity over the last 500 years . Especially from the early 19th century to the end of World War II, huge economic differences emerged in the world. Economic development trends show that until the end of World War II, the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia were far ahead of the Indian subcontinent and China in Asia, which had almost no significant economic growth.  The richest 20% of countries in the world are now about 30 times richer than the poorest 20%. Furthermore, income disparities between the richest and poorest countries persist; although the poorest countries have become richer, they have not caught up with the most prosperous. Why? This year's Nobel laureates have found new and compelling evidence to explain this persistent gap — differences in social systems. I think economists have made a lot of progress in their approach to trying to understand that economic growth is a process of accumulation of physical capital, accumulation of human capital, and technological change is obviously part of the story. When you look at the details, like in 19th century Britain or the United States, growth there was very capital intensive, very human capital intensive and very technology intensive. Patents for inventions emerge in an endless stream, and people come up with new technologies and rationalize production. However, the question is, why? Why did this process happen at a particular point in time and in a particular country, and not elsewhere in the world? Moreover, why has this process been associated with a huge increase in inequality across the globe, both between individuals and between countries? There are so many theories about this question that it would be disingenuous to say that people have never thought about it . In fact, people do think about it in various ways, although sometimes the economic growth literature may have gone in other directions and not given it enough attention. But these questions have been the backdrop to much social science inquiry, including much economic theory. However, I think that, on the whole, the influential theories of the last four or five decades have not been entirely satisfactory. This is where James and I started thinking about this question, particularly about the evolution of prosperity. We also focus on the evolution of institutions—the formal and informal rules of society and how they operate in economics, politics, and society. However, these theories often focus on factors such as geography (common among economists, other social scientists, and even physical scientists), arguing that climate topography, resource environment, and disease are important factors in determining the health of the individual.  The environment is an important determinant of long-term economic development. Other views can be traced back to the classic work of Max Weber, who contrasted Protestant and Catholic values ​​and argued that Protestant values ​​were more conducive to capitalist development than Catholic values.  Although the difference between Catholicism and Protestantism is no longer a hot topic today, if you look up some popular or somewhat scientific articles, you will find that they are full of how to understand Africa and Europe, Latin America and North America, India and Discussions with Pakistan and different development paths in Western Europe. These discussions sometimes touch on the role of religion, attitudes, and values.  And I think when you dig deeper, you find aspects of social, economic and political life that interact with these factors. For example, it would be ludicrous to say that religion plays no role in Pakistan's society, economy and politics . However, the question is, is Pakistan's interest in religion different from Switzerland's? Is that the reason why Pakistan is so much poorer than Switzerland? And again, I think just like geography, it doesn't fully explain the big picture or why there's a 30, 40, 50 times difference between the richest and the poorest countries in the world today . Perhaps a more popular view among economists is what we call in the book the ignorance hypothesis, or if you want to call it the "well-intentioned but ignorant leadership hypothesis," which is that policy matters. Of course, if you have a policy that stifles innovation and discourages investment, that's bound to have an impact, but it could also be that those policies are made by leaders who are not sufficiently constrained. This means that leaders have the ability and freedom to choose good or bad policies. According to this view, prosperity comes from good policies and poverty comes from bad policies. However, sometimes leaders choose good policies and sometimes they choose bad policies.  The reason this view is so ingrained in economics is that economics as a science is both a positive science and a normative science. On the empirical side, many of economics' achievements, such as research analyzing how markets work, are world-class. However, when it comes to regulation, there is always a discussion about market failure and how to address it. So economics naturally tends to favor the idea that if there are bad decisions, we can fix them, and we have the ability to do that. Of course, another bias that makes us like this view is that it doesn't really involve leadership, economists tend to play the role of consultants, and we tend to think that good consultants are important, so this "prosperity and poverty come from good and  The idea that this is “bad advice” is quite attractive. However, I still have to say that this is not particularly relevant.  What I want to do today is not to go into the arguments that we elaborate on in the book, but to try to explain where we're coming from. In other words, I want to explain why we think these particular approaches are not very convincing, and I'll also talk a little bit about the statistical work. I want to explain this through a story. So first let me explain the alternative that James and I proposed. This is not just our opinion, of course; it is based on the research of others, especially that of Douglas C. North. He's one of the most influential economic historians who made similar points, and our research extends and expands on his work.  The best way to think about this is actually to go back to our first economics class, or to the economics class that you teach in your introductory course. So, in that principles of economics class, we didn't really talk much about institutions. I've had similar experiences teaching these courses myself, and I've also written books on the principles of economics. If you think about it, there are actually very specific types of institutions embedded in the way our rhetoric markets operate. In particular, we start with an idealized view of markets in which there are no barriers to entry and no political relationships that contribute to monopolizing any industry. Likewise, in the standard textbook scenario, there are very secure property rights because firms can sell products and enjoy all the profits, and they can make investments and benefit from them. Sometimes you might even be bold enough to talk about innovation and patents in a principles course, and that's all supported by a system, like patents or intellectual property, that makes innovation valuable to innovators. We also have an underlying system that we take as given, usually provided by the state and the public institutions that underpin the legal system. We have a legal system that is able to enforce the contracts we sign with suppliers, workers or banks. In standard discourse, we have a level playing field where individuals can choose occupations based on their comparative advantages. We have an education system, and we have state-provided roads and other facilities that allow people to participate in the economy. All of this is implicit, and we don't even question it in our principles of economics courses. These idealized entities are what James and I call “inclusive economic institutions.” The key here is that inclusive economic institutions -- the word "inclusive" is meant to emphasize that good institutions are not just those that provide guarantees like secure property rights, but that they provide those guarantees in an inclusive way, that is, They are broad based . Opportunities to participate in economic activities, start a business, apply for patents, etc. are all part of an inclusive economic system. But the thing is, if we look back throughout history, and even at many societies today, most societies are not really governed by inclusive economic institutions. So I think that, to some extent, the principles of economics course has a correct sense of what these economic institutions should be , but it doesn't quite accurately describe how they behave in the real world. In the real world around us, the situation is more complicated. If you look at history, and even in some contemporary societies, they're actually pretty close to being the polar opposite of inclusive economic institutions. I call them “extractive economic institutions,” not just “exclusive economic institutions.” Because I want to emphasize that insecure property rights, barriers to entry, regulations that hinder the functioning of markets, individuals choosing careers that make a lot of money, creating an uneven playing field, all of these things are the opposite of an inclusive economic system.  I want to argue that these phenomena are not the product of accidental mistakes or some confused economist or bad leader. They exist for a reason.  The aim is to create a particular form of unequal society. In such an unequal society, elites and politically powerful groups benefit directly or indirectly by extracting resources from other members of society . Examples of direct gain include sometimes taking property rights from others; think of the colonization of large parts of the early world. Colonists arrived in these places, plundered precious metals, land, and expelled the indigenous people. Furthermore, those in power sometimes benefit directly. For example, think about how apartheid worked in South Africa. It does this by excluding 80% of the black population from opportunities in most lucrative professions. Blacks were excluded or excluded from professions such as skilled workers, engineers, artisans, and craftsmen. This, combined with the fact that certain urban areas were organized in a way that made it almost impossible for blacks to produce valuable agricultural output, led to low wages for blacks, which indirectly benefited politically powerful groups. So this is just a brief overview of what we mean by extractive economic institutions. I want to give a relatively brief talk here and leave time open for questions and discussion, but if there's time, I'll come back and further explain the many forms of extractive economic institutions as the antithesis of inclusive economic institutions. As I've pointed out before, extractive economic institutions sometimes involve the direct expropriation of others' property, and sometimes they involve the manipulation of market prices to profit without directly expropriating others' output, innovation, or investment. Now I want to use a specific example of extractive economic institutions in action, both to clarify what I mean and to bring up an important point I want to make. Let's take Barbados as an example. In the 17th century, Barbados was one of many societies based on typically extractive economic institutions, such as slavery. Slavery had all the characteristics of an extractive economic system that I mentioned, such as insecure property rights. In Barbados, over 80% of the population were slaves. They don’t even have property rights over their own bodies (human capital), let alone property rights over material possessions. This system created a completely uneven playing field, as these slaves had no education or access to health care. In fact, most slaves died before the age of 30 due to extreme hard labor and malnutrition .  The life of slaves was characterized by the complete absence of any incentives or security that might have encouraged them to be more productive or to make their activities more efficient. Indeed, in Barbados, as in many other slave societies, slaves were explicitly prohibited from investing in their human capital. All of this is based on a non-market mechanism and compulsory means. Slaves could not choose occupations based on their comparative advantage or desires, nor did they have any ability to negotiate or determine their wages. Instead, they were forced to work on sugarcane plantations, where their wages were determined by their masters through coercion and barely maintained at a basic survival level. It is safe to say that the slaves did not choose this system. Needless to say, this was not a "happy" slave society, despite the myth sometimes created in the American South, propagated by slaveholders, that such a society existed. We do not believe this. In any case, Barbados is clearly not such a society. You can see this from simple statistics. Slave revolts occurred frequently. So how did Barbados maintain this system for nearly 100 or even 200 years? Barbados is able to maintain this system because it relies on military coercion, or the use of force to maintain the system. You can see that political power exists, but how does it work? Let us consider for a moment what Barbadian society actually looks like. First of all, as I said before, over 80 percent of the population were slaves, and you would think that the remaining 19 or 17 percent were slave owners and were living a very comfortable life. But in reality, this is not the case. Most of the remaining people were small craftsmen or those in medium occupations who supported the operation of slavery, or they were soldiers. It wasn't the majority of slaveholders who really benefited from the system; many of them owned only a few acres of land.  The real majority of slaves worked for a handful of about 40 families, who were the largest plantation owners on the island and made nearly all of the profits. These families thus became some of the wealthiest in England (when they returned to Great Britain). So this was a deeply distorted society where only a tiny minority benefited from slavery at the expense of at least 80 percent of the island's population. How did this system survive? It survives because that small group of people actually controls all political power. The army as an institution was very important because it was responsible for suppressing all slave rebellions.  The commanders of the army were members of these families.  The island's laws laid the foundation for a deeply unfair society that continually oppressed slaves and always held them accountable for various infractions. Not surprisingly, the island's senior judges also came from these families. And, perhaps most importantly, the island's governor and senior politicians also came from these families. Therefore, I call these political systems that concentrate economic power in the hands of a few people "extractive political systems." Especially under these systems, political power is monopolized by a few people, and the exercise of power is rarely restricted or supervised. In contrast, I have come up with another ideal type: the “inclusive political system.” Under this system, political power is distributed broadly and inclusively. Of course, the above is a huge simplification. No society has a perfectly ideal system of pluralism and distributional political power. However, these ideal types help us think about the problem and provide us with a standard for comparison. The point is that even though you find societies that have a mix of extractive and inclusive institutions, there are also societies that start to move from extractive political institutions to inclusive economic institutions. Ultimately, inclusive economic systems and inclusive political systems will reinforce each other, forming a positive feedback.  The example of Barbados shows that extractive political institutions and extractive economic institutions are also mutually supportive.  This is very clear in the case of Barbados . If they didn't have extractive political institutions, and if they gave slaves some voice, the last thing slaves would choose was their own system of slavery. The same is true for inclusive economies and inclusive political institutions, especially political institutions, and this is an important point. If you have extractive political institutions but inclusive economic institutions, there are always forces that push in a diagonal direction. This is because the wider distribution of economic power leads to demands for greater inclusion in the political sphere. On the other hand, it is usually the case that those who hold political power sooner or later begin to use their power to bend the rules of the game to their own advantage. Relying solely on various hidden mechanisms or the goodwill of dictators to prevent them from interfering with society's economic system can only play a limited role.  The main argument of the book is that inclusive economic and political institutions create powerful forces that drive economic growth, particularly by strengthening property rights and encouraging investment; at the same time, this helps to allocate resources in a more appropriate way. However, this does not mean that market competition is without any constraints; rather, it means that markets, with appropriate regulation and context, can allocate resources better than central planning. For example, if all resource allocation is based on markets, but only the rich have access to those allocations, then markets will work poorly. In practice, this means supporting markets through distribution or other infrastructure and allocating resources appropriately, for example by limiting risk-taking in the financial sector. Then, the market will have the ability to achieve a better allocation of resources as part of inclusive growth. And most importantly, in my view, we should promote broad participation, including education, free entry, growth-based property rights, not just for a few but for the majority, and enable people to live according to their own will.  Willingness to choose a career. For example, South Africa could not achieve inclusive economic growth during apartheid even if it encouraged investment through Western companies or mining companies . Even where markets play an important role in some consumer goods and other services, it is unlikely to achieve inclusive economic growth because it does not create broad participation. Instead, it excludes 80% of the population from participating in many valuable economic activities. Growth under Inclusive Institutions The key is that investing in new technologies leads to “creative destruction,” a term coined by Joseph Schumpeter. It means that new technologies, new companies or new skills will constantly replace old ones. I will return to this issue later. One point I should emphasize, and I will come back to it later, is that James and I do not claim that economic growth can only be achieved under inclusive institutions. Our claim is that inclusive economic growth—the type of economic growth that is generally more durable —is possible under inclusive institutions. We'll talk about growth under extractive institutions, but we'll see that this growth has very different characteristics. It's not usually permanent; more than that, it tends to come and go in stages, and, in a sense, it contains the seeds of its own destruction. I think perhaps the best way to demonstrate this is through a historical example, which is what I will briefly explain. In particular, a large portion of the book is devoted to how this theory applies to contemporary situations, which I will not discuss in detail due to time constraints. I think the best place to start to understand these issues is with the early days of colonization of the Americas. There you can meet a lesser-known conquistador, Juan Diaz de Solis. He began colonizing what is now Argentina, the southern tip of South America, in 1516. This was around the same time that Cortés was ruling Mexico. However, Solis's colonization efforts were a huge failure. In fact, Solis was executed by a group of Charruas.  The Charruas and Querandi, the Indian tribes of Argentina at the time, were not at all what the Spanish expected. They were a scattered, highly mobile, non-sedentary, non-hierarchical Indian tribe. They were very aggressive, but most importantly, they could not be easily captured, let alone captured in large numbers and used for labor. This was not the result the Spanish had expected. In reality, they hoped to capture all the gold and silver and put the local Indians to work. When the plan failed, a period of famine set in, and they left the area and pretty much gave up the effort. At about this time, another conquistador, Juan de Ayolas, sailed up the Parana River to Paraguay and discovered another Indian tribe, the Guarani.  People (Guarani). Although the Guarani were not Aztecs or Incas, they were distinct from the Charruas and Queranti. They met Spanish expectations of what an Indian should be: they were settled, densely populated, and had their own hierarchical structure, with kings and nobility. This is the kind of social structure that the Spanish can manage. They immediately conquered the Guaraní, declared themselves an elite class, married Guaraní princesses, and put them to work.  The Spanish took advantage of existing extractive institutions among the Guaraní and adapted them to their own needs. Such systems later evolved into the encomienda system - which included forced labour and the mita (forced labour in the mines). These institutions began to develop at about the same time as similar ones among the Guarani, Incas, and Aztecs . These economic institutions were extractive, but they were also established through the use of force. It wasn't just the ability of the Spanish to use overwhelming force, it was their ability to take over these extractive political institutions - highly hierarchical institutions, with the Guarani, the Aztecs, the Incas at the top.  Military power enabled the Spanish to establish these institutions. So, what about the United States? Was it culture, geography, or good American leadership that led to its growth? To find out, let's look to history. In some ways, the key American colonization attempt was the Virginia Company 's actions in Jamestown, Virginia, which began 90 years after Juan Díaz de Solís began his colonization.  The Virginia Company was essentially a for-profit enterprise in London where people invested money in the hope of making a profit.  The reason they think they can make a profit is because they have learned from the Spanish experience.  The Spanish experience, as we've seen, is that you can go there and mine a lot of wealth, like gold and silver, and you can use a lot of labor to grow food for you and create an agricultural surplus. With this in mind, the Virginia Company sent three ships to Jamestown in 1607. However, like the Spaniards in Argentina, they also suffered unexpected setbacks. They encountered dispersed, non-sedentary, non- hierarchical, mobile Indian tribes that were unwilling to cooperate with them. They went through a period of famine, and nearly everyone died. Clearly, this strategy doesn't work in the United States.  The key reason for this is that the Americas had no tribes like the Aztecs, Incas, or Guarani that they could conquer or occupy. Therefore, they decided to abandon Jamestown completely to reduce their losses. However, they later came up with a different idea. They believed that if they couldn't capture and make local people work, they should import low-skilled, forced labor from elsewhere and produce on the surrounding, very fertile land. This would create surplus and profits for the Jamestown elite and the Virginia Company shareholders . This marked the beginning of indentured labour in the Americas. These men signed a contract that the Virginia Company would pay their expenses, and in exchange they would work for the Jamestown Colony for a certain number of years at very low wages and under the control of the colony. This is completely different from the image of the Puritans and other colonists that people imagine when they read American history today . To help you understand this better, here is a quote from the then Colonial Governor, Sir Thomas Gates, and Lieutenant Governor, Sir Thomas Dale: “No one shall flee from the Colonies to go to the Indians. Anyone who stole food from a public or private garden or vineyard, or stole ears of corn, was punished by death. No member of the colony could sell or give goods from the colony to the captain,  A sailor or boatswain who smuggled supplies out of the colony would be sentenced to death. So this was not a happy colony. Almost any violation of the law could be punishable by death. More importantly, those who harmed Virginia  The Virginia Company wanted you to follow their instructions if you were to trade with others for your own benefit.  production, and take away all your surplus production, which is how they make money. However, open borders, living with the Indians and conducting private transactions are better than being controlled by  The rule of Sir Thomas Gates and Sir Thomas Dale was far more appealing. Just 11 years after the founding of the colony, they abandoned the effort. They realized that whether they used the native population or indentured servants, None of them worked. So they came up with a huge innovation, even though it was not their choice and it was not their intention. However, they had no choice. They thought they could not continue to manage the colony, so they came up with America -  This was something that had never been done before, either in North America or South America. The innovation was the introduction of private property. They allowed people to own land under the head-right system. Every indentured servant and settler  Everyone who bought a piece of land was given a piece of land to do with it as they pleased. However, there was a catch. Sir Thomas Gates and Sir Thomas Dale had threatened to punish you if you sold the ears of corn you produced , but now they told people  , they owned property rights and they secured them. Under these circumstances, it is understandable that some people would be skeptical. In short, in 1618, there was a disconnect between the economic system and the political system.  The economic system began to move toward inclusiveness, and for the first time, the political system also moved toward inclusiveness and the establishment of a parliament. Similar developments occurred repeatedly in other colonies, such as Maryland and  The same pattern was observed in North Carolina. Those companies that gained monopoly power tried to create extractive institutions, but because conditions were different from those in South America, they failed and were eventually forced to give in and adopt more inclusive economic and political institutions. Why I tell this story, that is - "second-hand history". Why is this not a history lesson, but an economics lesson? I tell this story because I think it's really important, and it really shows a pattern that you can see in statistics, econometrics, and other historical evidence if you're willing to look at it. This pattern does exist. This pattern suggests that the problem is neither culture nor geography. Geography wasn't what distinguished Jamestown, because the pampas around Buenos Aires were just as or even more productive, which is why they had so many people there. In fact, this is one of the foundations of some econometric work that Simon Johnson, James Robinson, I, have done on the problem of "reversal of fortune." Furthermore, this is certainly not a leadership issue. Sir Thomas Gates and Sir Thomas Dale were failed leaders; they fled home with their tails between their legs. They did not introduce inclusive economic and political institutions through good leadership planning. Instead, they were forced to do so. Their failure was that this was not what the Virginia Company wanted.  What the Virginia Company wanted was political and economic power so that it could keep large numbers of people working for them at low wages. Reversal of fortune. In the poorest and most sparsely populated areas, European colonists introduced social institutions that contributed to long-term prosperity. After the Industrial Revolution, the former poorest colony became the richest colony. So James and I thought that this marked the beginning of the difference. Of course, these events did not last. It's not that you have a small peasant society in the United States governed by a parliament of a few people. You also don't have the big land grants or the mita system like in Latin America. However, this opened the way for differences between the two parts of the North and South American continent. You can see this in a very simple way. For example, look at what happened in Mexico and the United States in the 19th century. At first, the United States and Mexico look very similar.  The gap between the two was small in 1700, maybe a little bit bigger in 1800, but then throughout the 19th century, it became huge.  What's happening here is that the United States is seizing the opportunity to industrialize in a very inclusive way.  It should be emphasized that not everything was inclusive, because there were a lot of other things going on, like the seizure of land from Indians and the emergence of monopolies in the late 19th century. Yet, at its core, there's a very inclusive element, and you can see it in the many emerging entrepreneurs filing patents, creating new technologies, opening new businesses and new factories. However, you don't see a huge continuity in who the industrial giants or technical experts were in the second half of the 19th century or earlier. It is this openness to new ideas that is truly the root of America's economic growth. On the other hand, what happened in the South? Let’s take Mexico as an example. Mexico experienced a long period of stagnation under colonial rule. Then colonialism ended, but not because of people's revolutions to create inclusive institutions. It was a coup by an elite that wanted to create a more extractive economic system. These elites are led by military personnel. In Mexico, there was a period when 45 presidents came and went, sometimes the same person served multiple times, and most of them were from the military. During this period, military strength led to instability and the Mexican economy collapsed across the board. Then, under Porfirio Díaz, there was a period of economic growth, but it was a very different kind of economic growth, what I call "extractive growth," which brings me to my final point.  a little. It is extractive growth because it occurs under extractive institutions, especially extractive political institutions.  What we saw in Mexico under Porfirio Díaz was rapid industrialization, but that was by Mexican standards.  In the 19th century, Mexico experienced economic growth for the first time after Diaz came to power after 50 years of stagnation, because there was some stability and rule of law. However, if we look closely at the details, we see that this is very different from the situation in the United States. Mexico's economic growth has been based on monopolies, with a small number of companies dominating their respective industries. For example, at that time, there were about 20,000 banks competing in the United States , while there were only two banks actually operating in Mexico. The two banks mainly provide loans to companies with political connections. This means that everything is about Porfirio Díaz. Industrialization driven by monopolies granted by Porfirio Díaz. So, Mexico has economic growth, but not productivity growth like the United States. There is no productivity growth because this growth has not led to innovation and technological change. Most importantly, this extractive growth does contain the seeds of its own destruction. This growth is closely associated with an unequal distribution of economic gains. The gains came at the expense of the people, and the growth did not result from the innovation of certain people but rather unfairly benefited them. This situation ultimately led to events such as the Mexican Revolution and Civil War. This is a general pattern that suggests that sustained extractive economic growth is very difficult. Historically, more countries have experienced extractive economic growth than inclusive economic growth.  The reason is that extractive economic institutions have historically been more common than inclusive ones. However, economic growth under this system will not be sustainable. For example, Barbadian society was once very wealthy because of the high value of sugar, but this did not last, and once the price of sugar dropped, the Barbadian economy became very weak. It did not industrialize or become a technologically dynamic or human capital-focused economy until the second half of the 20th century. Another example of extractive economic growth is Russia, both in the 19th century and under Stalin. To achieve extractive economic growth, certain prerequisites are required, such as political centralization. For example, you can't have extractive economic growth in Mexico when you have 25 warlords fighting each other . Under Porfirio Díaz, extractive economic growth was possible because of political centralization.  The key point, however, is that this is only possible if the political power holders in society believe it is in their interest to do so, and this is where “creative destruction” comes in. Creative destruction means they won't always feel that this is in their interest. I think the best example of this is China today. China is a classic example of what we call "growth under predatory institutions," and it became a symbol of institutional change. To understand China's economic growth, we must start with the economic system during the colonial period. These systems provide no incentives for anything, not investment, not productivity gains, not even agricultural crop selection. Subsequently, it gradually transformed into a community responsibility system, a cooperative system of village-run enterprises, and eventually formed a private property system in agriculture, the entry of private enterprises, and the restructuring of some state-owned enterprises. Today, market incentives are everywhere in China, and anyone who comes to China will be struck by the dynamism of the Chinese economy, because people are so motivated to make profits, to innovate, to take risks, but all of this has its limits. All of this happens within the framework of a politically predatory system.  The biggest worry of the Chinese Communist Party leadership is "creative destruction." This is what we call in the book – the fear of creative destruction. Part of the reason extractive institutions fail to persist is that they cannot be transformed into inclusive institutions. Ultimately, they are not an institutional arrangement suitable for long-term sustained economic growth because of the fear of creative destruction. If we look at the speeches and behaviors of every dictator, they all talk about stability, and the most important meaning of stability is that they don't want changes in society that might undermine their power. Yet stability is sometimes beneficial, such as during periods of growth under extractive institutions; people preferred the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz to the chaos of warlords killing each other. However, this is not a strategy suitable for long-term economic growth, which requires creative destruction and a social form that is open to change but does not give political power to tilt the playing field. Finally, I will briefly touch upon some points that were not covered in the lecture. I did not discuss why these institutions exist. I told you about path dependency changes, and this is really critical. I gave a very simple example of how extractive and inclusive institutions emerge. —Colonial powers attempted to impose extractive institutions, which worked in some cases but failed in the case of North America. However, if you want to understand long-term economic development from this perspective, you need a theory of institutional change. We try to present such a theory in the book, although we know it's not perfect. The theory is based on a concept we call conflict-differential institutional drift, in which small differences lead to institutional divergence during particularly important political periods and critical moments . We emphasize the historical determinants and contingencies that combine to create small differences that have far-reaching consequences.  What I haven't discussed yet is how to actually apply these ideas to the world today. Because if we look at the simplest examples of extractive institutions, like slavery, many of those institutions no longer exist. Sure, there are a few places like Nepal and Uzbekistan where some form of forced labor still exists, but nowhere is it like Barbados was. However, the argument in the book is that we can still identify these extractive institutions, or extractive elements in many of the institutions that exist. If we look at Colombia, there's a core around Bogota, the capital, and similarly in Lahore and Islamabad in Pakistan, and those areas seem to be functioning well. But if you go deep into remote areas of Colombia, you'll find that a third of the country is under paramilitary or guerrilla control, and the elite dominates everything politically and economically. Likewise, much of Pakistan is very different from Lahore and Islamabad. So what we're seeing is really a mix of extractive and inclusive institutions. At the same time, we must also think about how to truly get rid of extractive systems and move towards inclusive systems.  The ideas in the book resemble incremental steps toward inclusion. We also discussed in detail how societies can break the chains of extractive institutions. But why do we fail sometimes? Why does the phenomenon we call "the iron law of oligarchy" occur? People try to take a step toward inclusive institutions, but some force pushes them back or even further into extractive institutions. Finally, we provide an extensive discussion of why economic growth under extractive institutions is very different and why it fails to generate the innovation and technological change that would lead to more sustained economic growth. We also explore policy pitfalls, rather than offering clear solutions or one-size-fits-all approaches to creating inclusive institutions. This is a political process and there is no simple formula to achieve it. In addition, some new ideas, although not mentioned in the book, are relevant to current discussions, namely why the "middle-income institutional trap" occurs, which is very inspiring to many societies, including Pakistan, Turkey, Chile, Colombia, etc.  Parts of these countries have become more inclusive, but there are still large economic and political structures that keep each other going. Finally, what James and I want to convey is that we do not claim to have the answers, and this book, Why Nations Fail, does not claim to provide them. But what this book does, what I try to do, is to provide a useful framework that is much better than simply talking about geography, culture, leadership and market failure without considering political institutions. In short, this framework is based on ideas from research. Many ideas come from research results in econometrics, theoretical models and game theory. It is a framework that can continue to be built upon.  There were a lot of things that James and I didn't know yet, like we didn't fully understand Pakistani society because it wasn't our expertise. But the real question is, does our framework give us a better lens to understand what's happening in Pakistan or in Africa? We think the answer is yes. However, this is still a work in progress and a direction for future research.
