Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Alleged H-20 First Flight Footage Analysis:**

*   A video purportedly showing the first flight of the Chinese H-20 stealth bomber has emerged.
*   The video's authenticity is questioned, but initial analysis suggests it may be legitimate, although some anomalies exist.

    *   Single central control suggesting a single engine, which is unusual for a heavy bomber.
    *   Uncertainty regarding the chase aircraft and its angle relative to the bomber.
    *   A slightly different video version with questionable perspective.
*   The video is treated as potentially real for the purpose of analysis (with a caveat of skepticism).

**II. H-20 Design Elements (Based on Alleged Footage):**

*   **Size:** Estimated to be twice the length and wingspan of a Flanker fighter, aligning with its intended role as a long-range strategic bomber.
*   **Wing:**  Swept-back high-aspect-ratio wing, designed for subsonic cruise, potentially similar to airliner wings with stealth features.
*   **Fuselage:** Well-defined and large, likely flattened with engine intakes above.
*   **Tail:** Flat shape with two short V-tail surfaces (shallow V), a puzzling design choice, potentially increasing radar signature.

**III. Speculation and Open Questions:**

*   The single engine aspect and tail design are unexpected and raise questions about the aircraft's true nature.
*   Could it be a large drone instead of a traditional bomber?
*   The video could still be fake.
*   Further analysis is needed to confirm H-20's design and purpose.

**IV. Additional Points:**

*   Early flight status, suggesting a prolonged development period before deployment.
*   Reference to an October photo on social media showing H-20 on the runway, potentially conflicting with "first flight" video.

**Core Point:** The video, if genuine, reveals initial design elements of the H-20 stealth bomber, but raises many questions regarding unexpected design choices, its purpose, and authenticity.

**Fundamental Point:**  Despite new military hardware being unveiled, including the alleged H-20, questions still exist concerning the true nature and intentions of its strategic design.

**Overarching Framework:**
Analysis of a new video purportedly showing the H-20 bomber's first flight, with heavy emphasis on questioning authenticity and presenting a preliminary technical evaluation based on visual observation.

Content:
 At the end of 2024 we had two new fighter jets, a new AWACS and the launch of the Type 76 amphibious assault ship. And now, a few days into 2025, we have this. This is allegedly footage of the first flight of the H-20, the Chinese stealth bomber. The H-20 has been in development for quite a few years now. In 2022, there were rumors of an imminent first flight, but then nothing happened. It was supposed to appear to the recent Zuhair show, but nothing happened. And now we have the shoot clip, which is everything we have at the moment of writing. The first question is, is this legit or fake? Well, I am no expert, but I loaded the clip in the windshield result, which is the software I used for editing the videos, and I zoomed in as much as I could. I did not notice any strange artifacts that could make me think to computer graphics or anything like that. It is probably sharpened by the phone camera, but otherwise it seems quite legit to me from this point of view. There are a couple of strange elements though. One is the single central control, as if the aircraft had only one engine, which seems bizarre for a relatively heavy bomber like the H-20 is expected to be. The other is the chase aircraft, it may seem a J-16 or a J-11 at first sight, but the angle under which we see the chase and the bomber seem different. And also I can see no trace of the tail stinger. Even the silhouette as a whole is not entirely convincing. Moreover, there is another slightly different version of this video, where the corner of a red building appears for a fraction of a second and the perspective is not entirely convincing either. So I can't conclusively say whether the H-20 video is real or fake. However, for the sake of this video, I am assuming that the clip is real, just to analyze what we have seen. So what follows need to be taken with an excavator bucket of salt. The first element to notice is the size. An eyeball estimate is that it is twice as long and with twice the wingspan of the flanker. This is roughly consistent with the idea that the H-20 should be a long range strategic bomber. The very fact that it is with a chase plane means that it is either the first or an early flight. So the aircraft is still in early testing and it may well take many years for now before the first unit is deployed. The other noteworthy element is it is not a flying wing. So there is a classic sweatback wing with a high aspect ratio, which is to be expected for an aircraft that is designed to cruise at high subsonic speed for long distances. I would not be surprised if this wing, by the usual stealth implements, was more or less similar to the wing of an airliner. The wingswhip angle seems to vary and the inner section is probably linked to the fuselage with an increasing sweep angle. In the middle, there is a well-defined fuselage, which is quite large. I do expect that the aircraft will be more or less flat and the fuselage to be squished a little bit with the engine intakes above it. To be honest, in October, a picture circulated on socials are allegedly showing the H-20 on the runway. I can't say how legit this is, but it seems reasonable overall. With that came a picture of the aircraft in flight, so this would not be the first flight, which is more or less compatible with what we have seen in the video. The aircraft tail suggests a flat shape and two short and stubby V-tail surfaces, and this is probably a very shallow V, like shown in some speculative renders, which is quite puzzling. In the light of what we have recently seen with the So-Cul J-36, the Chinese are surely capable of building a tailless design. The two tail surfaces seem to be a large contributor to the aircraft's radar signature, and you don't want this in a stealth bomber. So while the tail and silhouette seems compatible with a stealth geometry, the two surfaces are quite strange indeed. I have seen some animations on the internet in which the tail surfaces move from being horizontal to vertical, but that would be an immense complication and a lot of extra weight on the tail for really questionable benefits, so I believe we can definitely exclude that. However, in general, this configuration doesn't seem to be particularly stealthy from behind, which is strange in itself, and we need to learn more about the aircraft to understand the reasons of this choice. And to be honest, I'm still puzzled by that single-control. Could this be a large drone with a single engine rather than the bomber? I don't know. Anyway, maybe this is all fake and this video is for nothing, which is pretty frustrating. However, this is not the end of Chinese themed content. There's plenty to talk about the other Chinese new systems, and we will do it in the following days. So stay tuned. So thank you very much for watching this show video. It's great to have had your attention even on such a shaky foundations.
