Imagine what the world would be like if time wasn't what we think it was . This is a fascinating and challenging idea. When the famous physicist Michio Kaku proposed the idea that time does not actually exist, it undoubtedly triggered deep thinking about the nature of the universe. He compared time and space to a piece of rubber that can be stretched,  It can be compressed like a trampoline. It is full of fun and revelation. Time and space are like a piece of cloth, like rubber, like a trampoline. And in this discussion, the amazing discovery of the James Webb Telescope adds a mysterious color to this view.  The super telescope has discovered a sky full of ancient galaxies. The whole sky is filled with galaxies. This telescope will be extraordinary. Their existence seems to confirm Michio Kaku's theory. These galaxies look like they existed before the Big Bang. This is in our original  There is undoubtedly a whole new level of mystery in the universe we thought we knew. The James Webb Telescope discovered six galaxies that have existed for 500 million years. Now, let's delve into the ideas of Michio Kaku. He believes that time is not an absolute, linear concept, but  Relative, plastic existence He said: "Time does not exist! The James Webb Telescope proves us wrong!" This is a major challenge to the Big Bang theory, especially after these explosive discoveries of the Webb Telescope!  The Webb telescope was launched into space on Christmas Day 2021. It is larger and more advanced than the Hubble telescope. This telescope put into space is like a super detective who has uncovered the deepest secrets of the universe. Its infrared instruments are like  A time machine allows us to peer into the past. Its incredible resolution and sensitivity allow it to detect ancient and faint galaxies that even the Hubble telescope cannot see. We are talking about distant galaxies and objects from the early days of the universe.  It's like playing a game of cosmic hide-and-seek with us. The Webb telescope is helping us unravel the complex mysteries of the universe, one infrared image at a time. It's like admiring the Webb telescope yourself in an art gallery. The stunning images captured saw distant galaxies twinkling on the cosmic canvas, but the discoveries sparked a reaction of shock and disbelief among astronomers and cosmologists, who were almost like being confronted with a masterpiece of realistic painting. The uneasiness stems from challenges to a fundamental theory: the Big Bang hypothesis, which tells us that the universe began with a huge explosion about 14 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. This has been a solid foundation for our understanding of the universe. However, new images from the Webb telescope seem to question the accuracy of this theory, causing a stir in the scientific community. These newly discovered galaxies are older, smoother and brighter than the Big Bang hypothesis predicted. Much more was expected. The discrepancy has even made experienced astronomers like Alison Kirkpatrick question what they are doing with their lives. Scientists are amazed and concerned about these galaxies because they  This challenges our traditional understanding of the universe: the universe is like an expanding balloon. Distant galaxies should appear smaller and smaller, but at some point they should start to appear larger because their light is coming closer to us. This sounds a bit strange, right? But it's important to our understanding of how an expanding universe works. Now, the Webb telescope has dropped a bomb on us. It's captured images showing that these galaxies are about the same size as our closer galaxies. It's like what you expect from a distant friend.  Even more puzzling is that these galaxies appear small on the horizon, yet they appear to be right next to you , just as large and vivid as you are. Even more puzzling is that these galaxies appear to be just as large and vivid in these images, despite being brighter and more massive than our own Milky Way.  Adding to the complexity of the puzzle, these galaxies also appear to be moving away from us faster, as shown by the so-called redshift. Think about it, in this ever-increasing  In the expanding universe, we thought that all the phenomena were reasonable, but now it seems that the situation is not the same. Back in 2014, some smart scientists discovered a very strange phenomenon when looking at the photos taken by the Hubble Telescope. They noticed that Galaxies at certain redshifts look like they're in a space that's not expanding at all. The Webb telescope has noticed this strange trend, too. Even galaxies at redshifts as high as 12 seem to be just as big as the rest of the galaxies . In other words,  See these distant galaxies from images taken by the Webb telescope  It seems to be completely unaffected by the expansion of the universe. This does not agree with the Big Bang theory that the universe is expanding. If we still insist on the expansion of the universe and the Big Bang, then the conclusion we draw will be very confusing: these galaxies must be very  Smallness can make up for the visual illusion caused by the expansion of the universe. It's like putting together a puzzle, but the pieces don't fit as well as we expected. Let's take a look at a galaxy called GHz2 observed by the Webb telescope. It is much brighter than our Milky Way. But it is only 300 light-years wide. By comparison, our Milky Way is about 50,000 light-years wide, and its brightness per unit area at GHz2 is 600 times that of the brightest galaxy in our vicinity!  What's even crazier is that GHz2 and the other newly discovered galaxies are incredibly densely packed together, thousands of times denser than the galaxies we're familiar with. These galaxies completely overturn our understanding of the expanding universe and the Big Bang theory. Astronomers and cosmologists are stunned by these discoveries. Because they suggest a very different story than what we've understood for years. The Hubble Space Telescope has discovered dozens of these dense and powerful galaxies, which are as powerful as the super-powered mice in the old cartoons. These galaxies have given scientists a complicated story. To explain these unusually small galaxies, scientists have come up with an idea that's a bit like playing with a magic toy car. This toy car is very small, about one centimeter long, but it can move like a real galaxy. They speculate that these miniature galaxies have been colliding and merging over billions of years to form the larger galaxies we see today, just as these toy cars collided and merged over time to form the larger galaxies we see today. However, the Webb telescope has taken detailed looks at these galaxies and found no evidence of such a cosmic collision. If galaxies were really colliding, we should see some signs of damage, such as a bit of disarray or distortion, like a small accident in a vehicle. But that's not what the Webb telescope saw. The galaxy it revealed is smooth and tidy, just like nearby galaxies. The galaxies lack any visible signs of damage or collisions. A study called "Panic" shows that there are ten times more of these clean spiral galaxies than theorists predicted. The discovery is like seeing a star on a busy highway.  "There are cars on the road that are moving very fast but no accidents occur, which challenges the impact theory. There are no signs of galaxy mergers, which means that the idea that these small galaxies grew into larger galaxies may be wrong. If they are not growing, it means that they started out So the expected optical effect of an expanding universe seemed to be absent. Without this expected illusion, the concept of expansion lost support. As a result, supporters of the Big Bang theory began to feel uneasy. The existence of these small, smooth galaxies indicated that the universe might be  The Big Bang theory faces a major challenge if it is true. Clues about the pre-Big Bang universe provided by the Webb telescope Recent astronomical discoveries may require a major rethinking of our understanding of the origin of the universe. The Big Bang theory has long been our  The cornerstone of our understanding of how it all began is the assumption that the universe began in a giant bang. But now new evidence seems to suggest a different story that could revolutionize our understanding of the history of the universe. Welcome to the age of the Webb telescope. This incredible  Trusted equipment The ability to look back billions of years into the universe is often called a time machine by experts like Michio Kaku. The Webb telescope is a super telescope that can see distant cosmic landscapes that are invisible to the naked eye. Moreover, it does not use ordinary light. The images captured by this telescope are not just beautiful, they tell the secret stories of distant galaxies. The colors in these pictures are not just pleasing to the eye, they are actually codes that contain a lot of information. For example, those young By analyzing these colors, astronomers can estimate the age of the stars in these distant galaxies . However,  Here the situation starts to get a bit complicated. Some stars in galaxies appear to be older than the universe itself. This is a daunting problem because according to the Big Bang theory, there could not have been any stars before the universe was born. Going a little deeper, the Big Bang theory also  The Webb telescope tells us that the deeper it goes into space, the more it actually travels back in time, so we should see fewer and fewer galaxies until we reach a "cosmic dark age" when no galaxies exist. However, things are not like this.  As expected, the observations of the Webb telescope show that Very soon after the Big Bang, massive galaxies like our own Milky Way existed. And there were surprisingly many of them. Amazingly, 100,000 times more galaxies than originally predicted were observed at redshifts greater than 10! This greatly challenges our traditional understanding of the formation of the universe, and the abundance of this galaxy calls into question the framework of the Big Bang theory. How could so many massive galaxies form in such a short time ? These groundbreaking discoveries are forcing scientists to rethink our ideas about the origins of the universe. Recent research has revealed 16 inconsistencies in the Big Bang theory that are like dropping a bomb on our understanding of the universe. These inconsistencies suggest that we  The long-loved Big Bang theory may be off track in more ways than one. It missed not just one or two issues, but 16 of its key predictions. And, according to new research, the theory only predicted one thing called  The abundance of deuterium was correct, but the predictions for helium and lithium were twice and a staggering 20 times the observed values. The theory also had trouble explaining the existence of giant structures in the universe. In theory, from the birth of the universe,  There has not been enough time to form these complex structures. This mystery also includes its misprediction of the density of matter in the universe, and the recently discovered asymmetry of the cosmic microwave background is completely unexpected. It's like a scene from a cosmic blockbuster movie.  A surprising twist has shaken the foundations of our understanding of cosmology. Now, the key to unlocking these cosmic mysteries is the Webb telescope - a technological marvel that may provide answers to these puzzling questions. Although these discrepancies are in our cumulative  These may seem insignificant in the vast context of cosmic knowledge, but they are of great significance. Each anomaly hinders our understanding of the universe as a whole, leaving us with an incomplete picture of the nature and origins of the universe. These latest discoveries are more than just blemishes in our understanding of the universe; they shake up our long-held beliefs about how the universe formed and evolved. They challenge not only our understanding of the structure of the universe but also the fundamental fabric of space and time itself. This in turn has profound implications for our understanding of the expansion of the universe, gravitational waves, dark matter, and even the ultimate fate of the universe. Think about how something like the density of matter  Seemingly simple discrepancies, if they differ from our predictions, could revolutionize our entire understanding of how galaxies form and evolve, and thus change our view of the role of dark matter in this process. Similarly, unexpected asymmetries in the cosmic microwave background could We have long thought that time was a stable thing that has always been tied to the evolution of the universe since the Big Bang. But if we find that the Big Bang theory actually has holes, what will happen to our understanding of time?  Your understanding of this may have to be completely turned upside down! This may make us rethink the way time flows and even how it interacts with space, challenging our traditional view of the continuity of time. Now, some avant-garde scientific theories are already challenging our traditional view of time. Some theories  It's crazy to think that time might just be an illusion created by human memory , right? This means that the past, present and future may actually be happening simultaneously - everything is happening together beyond the linear flow of time as we understand it. Although we feel that time moves forward, there is no such thing as a linear flow in the laws of physics. Time has to flow in one direction like this. Let's get even crazier: The Big Crunch theory speculates that if the universe stops expanding and starts contracting, time might flow backwards. Think about it, the universe starts to shrink and get hotter. It's a bit like a movie of the Big Bang played in reverse. This Big Crunch These theories could indicate that there is a cyclical pattern in the universe - a cycle of expansion and contraction - which could mean that there is a new universe. This way of thinking about an endless sequence of universes challenges our traditional understanding of time and has even led some scientists to say that the time we normally perceive may actually be just an artificial construct. This view is in Einstein's theory of relativity.  He found some support for his proposed link between space and time. In this new framework, the block universe theory states that past, present, and future events actually exist in a four-dimensional space-time continuum. Every event is in this interconnected framework. Think about it, our reality may be a three-dimensional stage where events unfold in time. Or it could be that everything is static and fixed in a four-dimensional framework. If we accept the latter view, then time becomes an illusion. The past, present, and future actually exist simultaneously, which challenges our traditional linear view of time. And it makes us rethink the nature of existence. British physicist Julian Barber has proposed a very interesting conception of time. He imagines our reality as a series of independent "now moments", similar to snapshots in a photo album.  In Berkeley's view, each moment is independent and unique, forming the fabric of our universe. He challenged our conventional perception of the past, arguing that our sense of the past is based solely on our memories, which creates the illusion of a linear timeline. Barber elaborates on this fascinating idea through his theory that the past may not exist as a concrete entity but is merely a product of our subjective experience. Each "present moment" occupies a vast conceptual landscape.  A specific location he humorously called "Plutonia." This landscape was governed by precise mathematical principles and existed outside the constraints of time. Beyond the boundaries of time, each point in Plutonia marked a unique "  Now” and this landscape embodies a timeless quality that challenges the traditional flow of time. Although this view is revolutionary Einstein's theory of space and time is the cornerstone of our contemporary understanding of the fundamental structure of the universe. His revolutionary insights, which intertwined space and time, have reshaped our understanding of the fundamental structure of the universe. Science always  Growing in revolutions Progress through constant challenge, refinement, and sometimes complete replacement of existing theories This ongoing inquiry and discovery is the cornerstone of scientific progress. Historical scientific revolutions reveal this dynamic. For example, the Earth was once the  The Ptolemaic model of the center of the solar system has dominated for more than a thousand years. Our knowledge of the universe is in urgent need of a major update! In the 16th century, a Polish astronomer named Copernicus proposed a crazy idea: the earth is not the center of the universe but one of the ordinary celestial bodies orbiting the sun. This idea completely overturned people’s long-standing beliefs and put the earth from Then, along came Newton, with his revolutionary theory of gravity. Newton said that all large objects exert a gravitational pull, which explains why the Earth orbits the Sun and the Moon orbits the Earth. Theory dominated for nearly three hundred years until 1915 when Einstein came along with his theory of general relativity. Einstein's theory brought about a huge shift in our view of the universe. He proposed the idea that massive objects like the sun are actually  It is the curvature of four-dimensional space-time. According to Einstein, the curvature of this space-time determines the path of celestial bodies, which is the gravity we feel. From the geocentric theory to the heliocentric theory, to Newton's theory of gravity, and finally to Einstein's general theory of relativity, we see  The continuous evolution of scientific understanding Einstein's theory of space and time has stood firm for more than a century  The theory was further strengthened by the detection of gravitational waves in 2015. But even the most robust theories can run into challenges. This was the case when Einstein's theory of general relativity ran into quantum physics. Physics and general relativity appear to be based on completely different principles. In the quantum world, the rules seem to be a little different. For example, particles can seem to exist in multiple places at once. Schrödinger's cat thought experiment is a perfect example of this concept: a cat,  A bottle of poison and a quantum particle. The cat is both alive and dead until it is observed. This directly conflicts with Einstein's idea of ​​a continuous, seamless space-time structure. Scientists point to this inconsistency. According to Einstein, the gravitational field cannot occupy more than one place at a time, but quantum physics shows that matter and energy can. Attempts to unify general relativity and quantum theory have encountered challenges, including mathematical inconsistencies. Sometimes the theories even  The tension between these two major theories of physics presents a strong challenge that requires new insights or possibly a paradigm shift in our understanding of the most fundamental structure of the universe. Now, discoveries by Michio Kaku and the Webb telescope are making us rethink the nature of time, challenging our traditional linear view of time. Theories like the Big Crunch even suggest that the universe could shrink, and time could flow backwards, inspiring the process from the formation of a new universe to our own.  These thoughts on the possibilities of restarting open up a whole new discussion about the cyclical nature of time and the universe. It’s really exciting! Einstein's theory of relativity is like a magical trick. It makes us understand that space and time are actually tied together like a four-dimensional family. Imagine that the past, present and future are not separate but like a still painting, together.  Existential physicist Max Tegmark describes this state as a four-dimensional world without a straight line of time. If this is true, then the passage of time we normally experience may just be a big illusion. This really subverts our understanding of our own existence.  understanding!  The current situation in the physics community is like that of treasure hunters. They are trying to find a unified theory that can integrate quantum mechanics and gravity. In the process, they have encountered many strange ideas, such as the famous string theory. String theory proposes a very  Cool idea: It says that elementary particles like electrons and quarks are actually made up of tiny vibrating strings. You can think of these strings like the strings on a musical instrument. Different vibrations, or notes, correspond to different particle strings.  What the theory wants to do is pull together the two giants of general relativity and quantum physics. But there's one very special requirement to achieve this goal: the strings have to vibrate in a staggering 11 dimensions! In addition to Einstein's four dimensions (three space dimensions plus one time dimension), there are seven mysterious dimensions waiting to be explored. Although string theory is beautiful in theory, it still lacks direct experimental support. These extra dimensions are still unknown. This has led to heated debate in the scientific community about the feasibility and testability of string theory. Due to these unobservable dimensions, string theory has also been met with some skepticism, prompting physicists to explore other possible unified theories in string theory.  In addition to the theory, there is a theory called loop quantum gravity. Unlike the smooth, continuous spacetime described by general relativity, loop quantum gravity believes that spacetime is actually made up of many small loops or lines, a bit like when you look closely at a piece of cloth - the surface  It looks smooth, but it is actually made up of many threads. At the smallest scale, spacetime is like a network of many connected loops or threads. When you zoom in, it looks like a digital picture made up of countless small pixels. However, to explore  These tiny areas are not easy because the scale of these structures is so small that our current technology is far from being able to detect these tiny structural changes. Physicists say that to detect such small scales, we may need a larger than current  Large Hadron Collider, a particle accelerator trillions of times larger How big is that! Physicists from the UK, France and Hong Kong are now investigating this question in a new way. They are using a gas of ultracold caesium atoms to form a so-called Bose-Einstein condensate in order to investigate whether gravity might display quantum properties. This radical idea is worth exploring. At the same time, the universe is so big that the light we receive from distant corners of the universe has traveled billions of light years through space and time, which may also help us understand these tiny space-time structures. If there are some small flaws in the space-time structure, Light coming from far away may interact with these flaws a little bit. Although each interaction may seem insignificant, if you think about it, these effects add up over a distance of countless light years and may produce some phenomena that we can observe. For the past decade, astronomers have been watching for gamma-ray bursts from distant galaxies. They hope to find evidence for a theory of loop quantum gravity. The light from these galaxies shows some strange anomalies in the spectrum, and no one has yet been able to explain them.  Does the distortion occur during the light's interstellar journey or does it come directly from the galaxies themselves? This is still a mystery. Physicist Sabine Hossenfelder highlighted this uncertainty. To figure this out, we may need to rethink Einstein's view of space and time - he saw space and time as a  The smooth, continuous stage on which stars and planets play their roles. But in the exploration of quantum gravity, we may need to think further, not just changing the script, but perhaps redesigning the entire stage. What if space-time is not a separate thing but is made up of  Is it created by the interaction between objects? That's the revolutionary idea proposed by physicists Laurent Flaher, Robert Lee, and Georges Hermanik. They believe that space and time may not be a separate entity but emerge from the quantum realm. This idea directly  This new perspective is not only precise but also groundbreaking, challenging the traditional view that space and time must be merged with the quantum world. It provides us with a completely new perspective on our understanding of the universe. Why is it so important? Because it could be the key to solving a long-standing mystery in quantum physics: quantum entanglement, a strange connection between two particles that can affect one instantaneously even when they are far apart. This seems to violate Einstein's theory of relativity, which he described as "action at a distance." If space and time really do emerge from the quantum world, then particles may be closer together at the quantum level than they are apart in physical space. It's like your loved ones are far away but you feel like they are right next to you. This feeling is closer than the stranger standing next to you. Flair, Lee and Hermanik have been studying this for several years.  It's a bold idea, and they move forward with cautious optimism. Their research is n't just about adding gravity to the existing quantum rules, but about imagining a world where quantum and gravity coexist. Their next big step is to incorporate time into their model. This is crucial to understanding the fundamental structure of the universe. While this may sound a little abstract, the impact of these theories goes far beyond academia and can affect our daily lives. Our understanding of space and time has influenced our understanding of gravity and quantum theory. Understand that many of the technological devices we use today are based on quantum theory.  A better understanding of the quantum structure of space-time may pave the way for future advanced technologies that could revolutionize our lives. In the framework of quantum mechanics and relativity, time and space are viewed as a unified four-dimensional space-time structure that can transform and influence each other. This means that the time we experience may just be an illusion, an illusion created by the brain when processing complex information. So, what kind of impact would it have if time really did not exist? First, this will completely overturn our understanding of the universe. We will no longer be restricted by the linear development of time, but will be able to examine the evolution of the universe from a completely new perspective. Second, this will open up new opportunities for the development of physics.  After the road is freed from the constraints of time, we may be able to discover more unprecedented physical phenomena and laws. Finally, this will also have a profound impact on our outlook on life. If we are no longer restricted by time, then the value and meaning of life will also be Now, the James Webb Telescope's findings seem to provide some empirical support for this view. These ancient galaxies make us realize that the universe we know may be just the tip of the iceberg. Before the Big Bang, there may have been a new universe that we cannot imagine.  The existence of these galaxies seems to tell us that time is not as simple and linear as we think. Of course, these discoveries also bring many challenges and questions. We need to study the nature and origin of these ancient galaxies in more depth to understand their origins.  How did it exist before the Big Bang? We also need to re-examine our understanding of time and the universe to find more theories and models that can explain these phenomena. The current space-time theory that has long dominated is now being challenged.  New theories are emerging in the race for theoretical physics Although it is difficult to predict which theory will win in the end, when this scientific revolution actually happens, it may bring a series of new discoveries and push our understanding of the universe into a whole new stage. In short, if time really does not exist, then  This will be a shocking and hopeful discovery. It will reveal a whole new face of the universe and give us a deeper understanding of the meaning of life and the universe. Thank you for watching.
