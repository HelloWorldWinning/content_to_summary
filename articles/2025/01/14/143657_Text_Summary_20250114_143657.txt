Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   Accurate cryptocurrency price prediction is crucial but challenging due to the market's nonlinearity and time-series data complexity.
    *   Traditional methods struggle with these complexities.

2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   The study employs three Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models: LSTM, GRU, and Bi-LSTM.
    *   These models are used to predict exchange rates for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC).

3.  **Experimental Results:**
    *   Bi-LSTM outperformed LSTM and GRU in predicting cryptocurrency prices.
    *   Bi-LSTM achieved the lowest Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for all three cryptocurrencies.
        *   BTC: 0.036
        *   LTC: 0.041
        *   ETH: 0.124

4.  **Conclusion:**
    *   The study's models, particularly Bi-LSTM, are accurate in predicting cryptocurrency prices.
    *   These models can be beneficial for investors and traders.

5.  **Future Research:**
    *   Further studies should investigate other factors influencing cryptocurrency prices, such as social media and trading volumes.

**Core Point:** Bi-LSTM demonstrates superior accuracy in cryptocurrency price prediction compared to LSTM and GRU models.

**Fundamental Point:**  The inherent nonlinearity and time-series nature of cryptocurrency market data necessitate advanced models like Bi-LSTM for effective price prediction.

**Overarching Framework:**
The research focuses on a comparative analysis of deep learning models, specifically RNNs (LSTM, GRU, and Bi-LSTM), to enhance the accuracy of cryptocurrency price predictions. It assesses model performance using error metrics (RMSE and MAPE) on real-world data (BTC, ETH, and LTC), aiming to provide practical, data-driven insights for cryptocurrency investors. This framework not only contributes to the technical understanding of applying RNNs in this domain but also provides potential benefits to those engaged in trading or investment.

Content:
Highly accurate cryptocurrency price predictions are of paramount interest to investors and researchers. However, owing to the nonlinearity of the cryptocurrency market, it is difficult to assess the distinct nature of time-series data, resulting in challenges in generating appropriate price predictions. Numerous studies have been conducted on cryptocurrency price prediction using different Deep Learning (DL) based algorithms. This study proposes three types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): namely, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bi-Directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) for exchange rate predictions of three major cryptocurrencies in the world, as measured by their market capitalization-Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC). The experimental results on the three major cryptocurrencies using both Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) show that the Bi-LSTM performed better in prediction than LSTM and GRU. Therefore, it can be considered the best algorithm. Bi-LSTM presented the most accurate prediction compared to GRU and LSTM, with MAPE values of 0.036, 0.041, and 0.124 for BTC, LTC, and ETH, respectively. The paper suggests that the prediction models presented in it are accurate in predicting cryptocurrency prices and can be beneficial for investors and traders. Additionally, future research should focus on exploring other factors that may influence cryptocurrency prices, such as social media and trading volumes.
