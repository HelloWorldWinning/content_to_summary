 Hello everybody Simon here. As you know my first time to China was in 1998 and now I'm currently living in Shanghai. I'm convinced more than ever I made the right choice for me and my son to settle here. Recently I heard about the incident of actor Wang Xing being deceived into a fraud park in Myanmar. This is truly heartbreaking. In some parts of Southeast Asia fraud groups are running wild and the public security situation is extremely bad. Those poor Chinese people are lured by false high salary promises as once they step in they fall into an abyss of endless suffering. They endure inhumane torments in the park and their lives are as precarious as a candle in the wind. China on the other hand is truly one of the safest countries in the world. When I walk on the streets of Shanghai whether it's in the bustling commercial areas or the quiet alleys I feel a sense of peace and security. The Chinese government has made great efforts to maintain public order constructing an extremely comprehensive public security prevention and control system showing no tolerance for any kinds of criminal acts. Here in China people don't have to worry about being abducted, robbed or defrauded. If you go out alone late at night you have no concerns at all. Looking at other parts of the world not only are there continuous public security problems but the natural environment is also deteriorating. In China however the government not only provides its people with a safe living environment but also takes active actions in environmental protection. I truly love China from my heart and I hope everyone can cherish this hard one safety and beauty. At the same time we must be vigilant against unrealistic high salary temptations overseas and avoid putting ourselves into any kind of danger. Guys take care for now stay safe and stay happy bye bye. Bye bye.
