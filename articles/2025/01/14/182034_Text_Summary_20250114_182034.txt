Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Core Ideas:**
    *   Stock prices are influenced by historical transaction data (long memory).
    *   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are effective for time series feature extraction.
    *   Attention mechanisms can selectively focus on crucial information.
    *   The paper explores RNN, LSTM, GRU, and their attention-enhanced (AT) versions for stock prediction.

2.  **Experimental Results:**
    *   GRU and LSTM models outperform basic RNN models.
    *   GRU slightly surpasses LSTM in performance.
    *   Attention mechanisms improve prediction accuracy.
    *   Increased network depth doesn't guarantee better performance.

3.  **Core Point:** This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using attention-enhanced RNNs, particularly GRU, for stock price prediction by leveraging historical data and focused feature extraction.

4.  **Fundamental Point:** Incorporating attention mechanisms into recurrent neural network architectures significantly improves the accuracy of stock price prediction models by selectively focusing on important historical data.

5.  **Overarching Framework:** The study uses time series data and recurrent neural networks to model stock price fluctuations, employing attention mechanisms to improve the effectiveness of these models for stock prediction.

Content:
Stock data have a long memory, that is, changes in stock prices are closely related to historical transaction data. Also, Recurrent Neural Networks have good time series feature extraction capabilities. The paper proposed prediction models based on RNN/LSTM/GRU respectively. The attention mechanism has the ability to select and focus "key information". Therefore, based on the conventional Recurrent Neural Network, this paper introduced the attention mechanism and proposed a prediction model based on AT-RNN/AT-LSTM/AT-GRU. And the paper modeled and experimented with it. The results showed that: (1) In the most basic comparison test of RNN-M, LSTM-M, and GRU-M prediction models, the GRU-M and LSTM -M was significantly better than the RNN-M and the GRU-M was slightly better than the LSTM-M; (2) The introduction of the attention mechanism layer was helpful to improve the accuracy of the stock fluctuation prediction model;(3) Deeper neural networks did not necessarily achieve better results.
