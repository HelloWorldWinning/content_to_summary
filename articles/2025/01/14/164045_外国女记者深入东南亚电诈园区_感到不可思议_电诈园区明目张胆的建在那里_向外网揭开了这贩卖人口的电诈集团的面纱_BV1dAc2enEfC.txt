Content:
 A little China. Everywhere you look there are signs in Mandarin. A lot of the people on the streets and in the shops are Chinese too. It's almost like a vast outpost and yet it's one we know that Beijing in part is wrestling with. Along its border with Myanmar and the north, China has cracked down on the scamming industry. But it's money from the Chinese underworld that still drives it. China has started to chase some of the worst offenders. Cambodia claims it has too. But the industry still booms in plain sight with new compounds constantly emerging. What started as a regional crime is now a global trafficking crime. This is a story about corruption and greed. Yeah, I mean it's a billion dollar industry. A secretive, vast, sometimes deadly enterprise where failure to meet targets can end in torture. The level of torture that these people receive daily is worse than any horror movie that's ever been. We're going to take you to the very heart of a criminal network going undercover inside Southeast Asia's scam centres for the very first time. We won't have any problems with police, it's okay. An exclusive investigation into a gated world worth billions of dollars. There are countless financial victims worldwide. But this isn't a story about them. How did you feel duping people? We're heading a little bit south of Massod into an area that we know as Taichung. It's commonly known also as Mountain View. For us it's one of the worst compounds that exists in terms of human rights violations, abuses, absolute torture of their victim. Judah Tana is on a mission. He's in Thailand over the river, his Myanmar, where thousands of people are working in prison like compounds known as scam centres. Their job to defraud people online. They're not all criminals. Some are trafficked, tortured, thrust into cyber slavery. What we often hear about is this black room or this dark room. It's essentially a windowless dark room where the victims are taken in. They're often chained with their hands handcuffed above their heads hanging from a ceiling. They are then not given food. They're tazed. They're unable to sleep. How do you go about getting people out? The reality is the majority of them have to pay exorbitant ransom to their families, sell everything. Judah's the first hope for those fleeing. Recently he's been getting a lot of frantic calls. Many trace back to a little known compound called Taichung. You can see it just across the border. I think that's a good idea if we just walk. I want you to actually see and experience the gravity of what it is that we're talking about. Because this compound has been built within the last 18 months. You're talking about as far as you can see this way all the way to the green roof building there. You can see land being cleared behind it, which only means expansion. Two things I'm really struck by is just how vast it is. But also it's there in plain sight so close to this type order. Yeah, you can almost reach out and touch it, right? And yet it's untouchable. You can't get in and nobody can get out. Is this in fact the place the world should be watching? Absolutely. This compound is without a doubt the worst. It is essentially hell on earth. The scam compounds are often run by Chinese mafia, supported by militias in Myanmar. Those who don't generate enough money for their bosses can be brutally punished. The UN estimates hundreds of thousands of people are working inside these Ford factories across Southeast Asia. The types of scams that are being run inside the scam centers are often focused on dating and relationships. They use many platforms, but behind most of them it's gaining some kind of trust with somebody in another country by pretending to be someone you're not. And by gaining that trust encourage them to join some kind of investment or cryptocurrency investment. And to build on that investment and to build on that trust until eventually have exploited them from all of their money. The notorious KK Park is one of many compounds that was able to grow and prosper along a lawless border in a country wrestling with civil war. What would you call it? These three men have just left. Three guys are just the KK-4. So I take them and send to immigration. Sami is a volunteer trying to stop human trafficking. Two years ago if you want to leave KK-4 you have to pay about 30,000 to 50,000 US dollars to leave. How much did it cost them? Only about 2,500 US dollars. Not really high. But to really understand the current dynamics you have to cross from Thailand into Myanmar where conflict rages and cyber scams thrive. We've been granted rare access to Yatai new city in Shwe Koko, a sprawling frontier of compounds and casinos. But the city management wants to show us this is a normal town with nothing to hide. This feels like a little China. Everywhere you look there are signs in Mandarin. A lot of the people on the streets and in the shops said Chinese too. It's almost like a vast outpost and yet it's one we know that Beijing in part is wrestling with. Along its border with Myanmar in the north, China has cracked down on the scamming industry. But it's money from the Chinese underworld that still drives it. Yatai says that's not what's going on here. Suspicious though is high. Phones are checked and we're escorted everywhere. Yatai's chairman wants to talk. You say you're just a property developer but you do profit from these compounds. Do you think that it's your... responsibility to crack down more forcefully? Do you accept that scamming has gone on in Yatai city in compounds and that some people have been trafficked here? between Annfinding and exposing now, one some people unable to get the $3. There's been so much pressure on making sure that the human trafficking side has been snuffed out and that there's no longer the sense of abuses or hiring underage children. The role in which Yattai and S.N. Shwekoko has played seems to be benefiting the anti-human trafficking movement. There is a public effort to combat forced labour here, but Yattai's founder, S.J. Zhang, was only recently sanctioned by the UK government, accused of links to scam centres and human trafficking. One rescuer also told us this building is currently home to a significant scam operation. The bar's there to prevent people from jumping. They clearly want to show the world that they're more open now, that working conditions here are better. The problem is we can't get into the compounds to see what the reality of life is like inside. We know that fraud factories exist across the region, but we need to work harder to get a close-up look. So we've been tracking one key area in Cambodia near the border with Vietnam. It's called Bovette and it's home to some shocking stories. Scammers rarely talk on camera, but this man who we're calling Pumjai has agreed to lift the lid on a murky world. He's Thai, but until recently he was a romance scammer in Bovette, targeting lonely people to invest, stealing their hearts and then their money. She is Organisation's first girlfriend. The two men and them were conflicting, and at last they were Dexan Street. In Cambodia, illegal gambling, love scams and crypto fraud aboom it. It can be lucrative. But with rampant growth comes brutal targets. Qumjai became a scammer by falling victim himself to a romance scam. Lord by a Thai recruiter who's now under investigation. He was passed around compounds until one fateful day he was accused of stealing. We want to find the compound Pumjai nearly died in but it won't be easy. They're highly secure places hard to get in even harder to get out. Around 40 Vietnamese people flee the Golden Phoenix Casino hoping they can swim back to Vietnam. Ben who's from the UK says he also worked there. Until I was in there I had no idea that I've been in Cambodia a long time now. Up into the Pumjai where I was in the compound I never heard of a scam factory. It was a whole different world just appeared in front of me. I had an altercation with another staff member and then I got punished. So I called him to the office, handcuffed to a chair and a security team was called in. I was executed with tases for maybe four minutes. We decide the only way we'll expose what's really happening in these heavily guarded compounds is by pretending we want to work in them. We're on our way to a building where we know two years ago nearly 250 people were rescued. We've been told that a scam operation is still going on there so we're going to go and see what we can find out. We walk in posing as people looking for jobs. Online what? Online. Online. Online. There's a heavy security presence. A steady stream of workers passed through a metal detector. We'll be at a police station. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. The rescuers have told us about scammers fleeing here. But we can't get any further without an appointment. Scamscenters are almost impenetrable, constantly changing names and locations. But we want to keep going. We've heard, but that is the new hub. It's on the border with Vietnam. A fortress like city. We're going to try to infiltrate. It feels kind of otherworldly being here. Everywhere we look there are gambling, adverts and these huge casinos. And then behind them these mysterious buildings and seemingly very little else. Down at Dusty Road we find the building where Pume Dry says he worked, was detained and fled. The building is a very small building. It's a very small building. It's a very small building. It's a very small building. It's a very small building. It's a very small building. It's a very small building. It's a very small building. It's a very small building. Doctors eventually helped to escape and return to Thailand. After two days we have a lead. We've been reaching out to recruiters today and we've just had a call from one who says they're willing to meet to discuss possible work so we can see what they have to say. They are surprisingly unguarded and unfiltered. The scam? Pig butchery. Tricking victims to fork out more and more money before going in for the kill. It's big business. Some scammers sign up willingly on the promise of big salaries and bonuses. What kind of work? It's a community, maybe for their office man and then they can welcome them and the threat is still. And the salary in here, more 8800 at first. All the same are like, as through people who invest in them. With their kill, the romance, Dan. Who is the best country to be wrong or hard before months at it? Going through there. Yeah, we take money from that. Because they don't like the way nobody gets arrested. But no, the police won't lock anybody. The police? Yeah. No, I know what the police are from the time. Because I can see like maybe the monitor of the criminal that he picked the other people. I know that 15 years we are so awful. So precious. Okay. That night, they arranged for us to do a job interview. We're met at a casino and driven to a compound. We're then asked to sit down with a man they call the boss, the head of HR and two other employees. They admit what they do is illegal from the off. You're so pretty. You have to know what you're doing here. Yeah. Can you explain that? Yeah. You're in the office. You're in the office. You're in the office. Oh no. You are doing the US matter. Oh, you are. You are. More or less people. And if you get the decline, you get more commission. Oh yeah. And how long how many goes a week? All the seven days a week. So you thought you were going to know? How much does the person that I'm the most in the chat? Do you train here or no training? You have training here everything. You want your master? If you come out and walk. Okay. My sister. She is the guy with a fear to achieve the client's life. Media love family. What kind of script do you follow? What? Oh, how cool. Ring the men. For that. I'm about to go back to the Sunday in the second day. The day all he gets is yours. Oh, he looks cute. Oh yeah. How many hours life? Why did you train the day? The day? The person who's not old or then you actually want trouble. Why do you hold the day? I don't know. How you do? If you don't want the training, that is the real... You already grow with the new design card. So far in class. After a lengthy chat, the team agrees to show us the accommodation. Next, we're exposed to something we thought we'd never see. The highly secretive scam rooms. We see scammers with lots of phones conducting multiple conversations with victims online. It's hard to know if other workers got a guided tour but it revealed more than we ever expected. We're very strange seeing that world up close. So I was surprised at just how organized the structure. It felt you had these rows and rows of people all focused on ultimately deforting people around the world. Across the border in Thailand, the cost of the industry is crushing. Cheer says his brother, Chow, died falling from this compound in Cambodia. He believes he was pushed. A suspect played like him There is a vast range of scam centres and scammers. Some greed driven, some desperate, some deeply sinister. Prosecutions though are rare. China has started to chase some of the worst offenders. Cambodia claims it has too. But the industry still booms in plain sight, with new compounds constantly emerging. What started as a regional crime is now a global trafficking crisis, with millions of victims. We reached out to those responsible for the compounds featured in this documentary. We also contacted the Cambodian government. None of them responded to our requests for comment.
