 You consider yourself someone with a strong mind? While there's no single definition for mental strength, many researchers agree that it's measured by inner strength, fortitude, self-control, and good emotional adjustment. Here are seven signs. You have a strong mind. Number one, you're in control of your emotions. A sign that you have a strong mind is knowing how to balance your emotions with logic. You don't react to situations right away, but rather you take time and approach it with a clear mind. Unlike others, you don't try to resist change or dwell on negative feelings because you know it doesn't do you any good. You're patient and strategic in reaching your goals, and you don't let your emotions cloud your judgment. Who? You know how to handle failure. Do you go after what you want, even if you know it might not work out? A sign of mental strength is determination and resilience. You're not afraid to fail. Set backs don't get you down for long because you know it's all a learning process. Even if it's scary or uncomfortable at times, you take risks and push yourself to be better. You know you can always bounce back from all of your failures. Three, you learn from your mistakes. Because you have a strong mind, you're able to accept when you've made a mistake and take responsibility for your actions. When things go wrong, you don't wallow in self-pity or hide behind excuses and shift the blame to someone else. Instead, you own up to your faults with honesty and maturity because you know that mistakes are just opportunities for personal growth. Four, you live life according to your values. Do you march to the beat of your own drum without caring what others think? It's a sign that you have a strong mind when you don't let other people's judgment hold you back from how you want to live your life. You're self-motivated and self-sufficient. Your choices are based on your values and principles. And popularity, money or power won't change any of that. After all, you are no blind follower. Five, you're able to be your truest self. Are you comfortable in your own skin? Another sign of having a strong mind is that you're open and true to yourself. Pretending to beat someone you're not to impress others or gain approval isn't something you do because you don't need validation from other people. You're not afraid to be vulnerable or to express yourself in an honest and heartfelt way. You're able to accept yourself for who you are. Six, you have a strong sense of self-worth. People with a strong mind also have healthy self-esteem and a stable sense of identity. No matter how bad things might get, your self-worth isn't tied to the opinions of others. You don't need external factors like fame or praise to make you feel you have worth. Rather, you find worth in yourself and in the strength of your character. And no one can ever take that away from you. And seven, you're a realistic optimist. Finally, a true sign of having a strong mind is if you can be realistically optimistic. You see things not only for what they are but also what they could be. While looking at the bright side of life, you keep your expectations reasonable and are careful not to let your optimistic tendencies blind you to reality. Even in the gloomiest of situations, you're hopeful and you keep a positive attitude. Do you recognize any of these signs in yourself? Would you consider yourself someone with a strong mind?
