**Outline and Summary:**

1.  **Initial Relationship:**
    *   A girl (referred to as "女生" throughout) and a man named Ji Xing Peng (吉姓彭) were high school classmates.
    *   Ji Xing Peng was attracted to the girl in high school, and they began dating after university.
    *   The relationship was initially loving, and the girl became pregnant.

2.  **Sacrifices for Love:**

    *   She tattooed Ji Xing Peng's name on her hand to express her love.

3.  **Relationship Deterioration:**
    *   Ji Xing Peng became possessive and paranoid, constantly checking the girl's phone records and questioning her whereabouts.
    *   Ji Xing Peng developed a drug addiction and accused the girl of infidelity.
    *   He also pressured the girl for money.

4.  **Post-Childbirth Issues:**
    *   After the child was born, Ji Xing Peng neglected his family, preferring to spend time with friends.
    *   A friend's joking comment about the child not looking like Ji Xing Peng fueled his paranoia.

6.  **Paternity Confirmation and Trial:**
    *   A DNA test proved that Ji Xing Peng was the child's father.

7.  **Sentencing and Aftermath:**

    *   However, due to his repeated violent behavior, the sentence was changed to life imprisonment.
