Description:
**Outline and Summary:**

1.  **Introduction: The "Crab Law"**
    *   The "Crab Law" is a metaphor for how people, like crabs in a bucket, often pull each other down, hindering collective success.
    *   Human nature is complex, requiring caution in interactions.
    *   Understanding the "Crab Law" is crucial for self-determination.

2.  **Manifestations of the "Crab Law" in Daily Life**
    *   Examples:
        *   An angry woman berating a fast-food worker over a delayed order.
        *   A security guard violently assaulting a delivery person during a parking dispute.
        *   These illustrate a tendency to "step on" others, often displaying a "violent temper."
    *  This behavior is rooted in negative energy, pushing people away.
    *  Empathy and kindness are antidotes to this behavior.

3. **Jealousy and Hindering Others**
    *   People become unbalanced when comparing themselves to others.
    *   Jealousy leads to hatred and attempts to suppress those who are successful.
    *  Linda from "Nothing But Thirty" exemplifies this, sabotaging her colleague Wang Manni.
    *   Instead of hindering, one should be motivated to learn and improve, not pull others down.
    *   Mutual support is essential because "no one is an island."

4.  **The Power of Mutual Support**
    *   Helping others ultimately helps oneself.
    *   The story of Wu Jing supporting Guo Fan in "The Wandering Earth" demonstrates how helping others can lead to mutual success.
    *   Altruism is the highest form of self-interest.
    *   People should support each other for mutual success.

5.  **Underlying Reasons and Consequences**
    *   People fear being surpassed, leading to jealousy and the desire to drag others down.
    *   This behavior can trap people, hindering their own progress.
    *   Resentment can lead to harming those at similar levels rather than those in higher social classes.
    *   People seek a sense of power through putting down others.

6.  **Navigating the "Crab Bucket"**
    *   Avoid naivety; not all people are sincere.
    *   Hide abilities to avoid attracting jealousy.
    *   Be mindful of sharing achievements.
    *   Use "Crab Law" knowledge to protect yourself.
    *   Build a strong circle by choosing the right people to support each other.
    *  The mentality of preventing others from climbing if one cannot climb is fundamentally foolish.

7.  **The Stupidity of Jealousy**
    *   Examples of "can't stand others doing well" mentality:
        *   Yue Yunpeng's experience with villagers being jealous of his success.
        *   Historical and fictional accounts of jealousy leading to harm.
    *   Jealousy is like a knife, harming others but ultimately hurting oneself.

8.  **The Difference Between Heaven and Hell**
    *  The fable of the long-spoon highlights the difference:
        * Hell represents individualistic, selfish behavior; and no one gets fed.
        *  Heaven represents mutual support; and everyone benefits
    *   Those who support each other will achieve more.
    *   Kindness and a willingness to lift others is a form of self-help and is a sign of wisdom

9. **Conclusion:**
    *   The "Crab Law" is a reflection of human nature's darker side.
    *   Self-improvement requires effort to escape the pull of the "Crab Law."
    *   Building bridges rather than stepping on others is the path to success.

**Core Point:** The "Crab Law" illustrates how jealousy and the desire to hinder others can impede collective progress and ultimately harm the individual.

**Fundamental Point:**  Success is more readily achievable through mutual support and uplifting others than by tearing them down, making kindness a pathway to personal advancement.

**Overarching Framework:** The content presents a framework for understanding interpersonal dynamics based on the "Crab Law," highlighting the dangers of jealousy and the importance of mutual support for success. It moves from problem (negative interactions and envy) to solution (building a network of support).

No matter who you get along with, you must understand the "Crab Law". The reason is simple. Human nature is complicated. In this society, you must be more careful when interacting with others. Only by understanding the "Crab Law" can you truly control your own destiny. What is the "Crab Law"? The "Crab Law" originates from a natural phenomenon: when a crab is put into a bamboo basket, it will try hard to crawl out of the bamboo basket. However, if there are multiple crabs in the bamboo basket, then every time a crab is about to crawl out of the bamboo basket, When the crabs are about to fall, they will cling to it and pull it down. In the end, no crab can escape successfully. In fact, people are also like this. Some people can't stand others doing well. When others are promoted or promoted, they always try to make trouble for them. So, When interacting with others, we need to be alert to the "Crab Law" Read Chinese classics and gain wisdom in life Welcome to subscribe to Avenue Wuxing [Refuse to step on others] A while ago, I saw a woman holding a movie ticket in a fast food restaurant getting angry at the waiter because her burger was not ready and she had to wait for another three minutes, but her movie was about to start. The woman refused to give in, her high-pitched voice filled the entire restaurant, and every word she said was aggressive. The poor waitress apologized vigorously. A similar scene also occurred in a parking lot outside Dongzhimen in Beijing. A delivery guy had a dispute with a 65-year-old security guard when he parked his motorcycle temporarily while delivering food nearby. The two sides could not reach an agreement, so the security guard threw the 30-year-old man over his shoulder. The delivery guy was thrown out. The delivery guy was seriously injured and was taken away by 120. In life, some people like to "step on" others and deliberately find trouble, never letting go of any opportunity to embarrass others and "enjoy" the embarrassment of others. This behavior looks It seems that he is shaking off his "power", but in fact he is exposing his "violent temper". The magnetic field of negative energy makes people avoid him. Writer Bi Shumin once said: If a person can empathize with other people's pain and helplessness, then he must be a kind person. When people let go of others, they are actually letting go of themselves. [Stay away from the crowd. ] Everyone cannot have the same things, and the achievements they make are bound to be different. This is actually a very normal thing, but it makes some people unbalanced in comparison. Jealousy breeds hatred and oppression of others I can't help but think of Linda, Wang Manni's colleague in the TV series "Nothing But Thirty". Linda and Wang Manni are both salespeople in a jewelry store. Linda's performance is not as good as Wang Manni's. She doesn't look for the reason from herself but thinks it's the deputy store manager. One day, a woman with a basket of vegetables and simple clothes came to the store. Linda looked at her and concluded that she couldn't afford it, so she was very indifferent. Wang Manni enthusiastically stepped forward and seriously introduced the store. Unexpectedly, Ms. Chen actually reserved a set of jewelry worth millions of dollars in full. Linda was jealous. She got Wang Manni's phone under the pretext of checking her friends circle and secretly pushed this customer 's WeChat to herself. The customer was not stupid, so he recognized Manni. Later, when Wang Manni was about to sign the order, Linda Linda tampered with Wang Manni's lipstick, causing her to have an allergic reaction. She almost missed the chance to sign a contract. In order to become the sales manager, Linda tried every means to frame Wang Manni. In the end, all of them were exposed. Linda had to resign. Russell once said: You must use it in places where jealousy is inevitable. Stimulate your own efforts instead of hindering the efforts of others. When facing outstanding people, some people do not think about getting close to them or learning from them, but try every means to pull them into the water, as if this way they can reach the top. However, they do not know that no one is an island, and only mutual help can help. The best plan for the future is [get close to people and support them] There is a saying that goes, helping others also helps yourself. Indeed, being kind to others and achieving yourself is the best interpersonal relationship. There is such a story circulating in the entertainment industry: When Wu Jing was invited by Guo Fan to shoot "The Wandering Earth", he saw that Guo Fan was short of funds, so he took the initiative to give Guo Fan 60 million yuan to support him to continue shooting. After the movie was released, it received rave reviews and the box office was close to 5 billion yuan. Wu Jing and Guo Fan The more intelligent people are, the better they understand how to help each other. They understand that helping others is creating opportunities for themselves. If they help others get what they want, their dreams will also come true. In fact, altruism is the highest level of self-interest. Everyone in the world Everyone should understand that people should support each other and achieve mutual success. This is the opportunity and basis for success and is also the most practical and feasible way. People always like to compare themselves with the people around them. They are afraid of being surpassed by others, afraid of being looked down upon by others, and afraid that the halo of others will make them In fact, it has become dull Few people want the people around them to live better than themselves. Even if they are in the same circle, when you are "hit by good luck" and suddenly surpass them by a lot, they will feel a big gap in their hearts and even feel jealous. Pull you down from a high place. You are also working hard for life, but some people are full of thoughts about how to step on others. They can only be firmly trapped in the bottom soil and cannot escape. Many times, good and evil are only a thought away. People are crushed by life and are full of resentment. They cannot harm people of higher social classes, but they harm others who are also at the bottom of society. Some people have a little more insignificant power and can't wait to expand it. They get a little thin sense of existence from the happiness of overthrowing their peers. In this busy world, we can never avoid the human weaknesses Just like crabs, they pull each other's legs and no one wants to let the other climb out. So when you get along with others, don't expect others to help you sincerely. You have to climb out of the bucket by yourself. In the fierce competition, everyone wants to climb up. No one wants to see others better than themselves. You treat others as friends and tell them everything you know. But you don't know that others are just pretending to be nice to you. Don't expect those who greet you with a smile to be sincere to you. Once you are no longer useful, they will turn around and leave. If you live better and climb higher than others, they will try their best to pull you down. If you are too conspicuous, you will attract jealousy and be easily plotted against. The better you perform, the more troubles you will encounter. No matter who you get along with, you must have Keep a clear mind, don't always think about being in the spotlight, don't just rush forward without paying attention. Only by knowing how to hide your abilities can you avoid those hidden arrows and open attacks. Don't be naive to think that as long as you treat others sincerely, others will also treat you sincerely. Most people would rather see that you are not as good as them. You think that success and achievements are the result of your hard work, but others only Seeing your dazzling halo, try not to share your happy events frequently when interacting with others, such as promotion, salary increase, successful career, harmonious family, abundant financial resources, excellent children, etc. These sensitive topics may become the fuse that destroys your relationship. The wise and far-sighted people in the world know how to hide their shortcomings and will not intentionally or unintentionally provoke the evil of human nature. The "Crab Law" is like a mirror that reflects the ugliest side of human nature. And this society is like a big bucket. We are all crabs in that bucket. If If you want to get out of this barrel, you have to be smarter than the other crabs. In this era full of challenges and opportunities, each of us is working hard for our dreams, but in the process, we must also be alert to the "crab law" and learn to protect ourselves in order to gain a firm foothold in this society. Only when you have the ability can you build your own circle, pull in those who are worthy, and build a real circle of good people, support each other, and achieve each other. Now many people in society have this mentality: if I am unhappy, then I want to see others unhappy too. If you can't climb up, you can also hold others and prevent them from climbing up. In the final analysis, the greatest stupidity of human nature is that people can't stand others doing well. The lower the level of people, the more they can't stand others doing well. The crosstalk actor Yue Yunpeng once said this in an interview. Experience: He came to Beijing from a rural area in Henan when he was 14 years old He struggled in the society and suffered all kinds of grievances. He worked as a security guard, a waiter and even a toilet cleaner. Guo Degang once said: Yue Yunpeng has done all kinds of suffering jobs in the world and has worked his way up to what he is now. When he was working as a waiter in a fried noodle restaurant, he met the "mentor" of his life. Guo Degang worked hard little by little, and gradually overcame the hardship of being a "worker". In the end, he turned around and became a popular crosstalk actor. The endless bitterness finally became his life. Fortunately, Yue Yunpeng said: After I became successful, I felt very uncomfortable every time I went back to my hometown. Because he found that no one in the village had a good word for him. When the villagers mentioned him, they only looked down on him and sometimes even said sarcastically: We don't like him. He just got lucky and met a noble person. In fact, he doesn't have any ability. . Mr. Lu Xun's description is particularly apt: Many people cannot bear to see others living a good life, and if others have what they themselves do not have, they will feel resentful. The book also says: I hate that you realized my dream first. I hate your superior life. I hate that you, whom I despised so much, now have a bright future. I also hate my own cowardice. I hate that I am not lucky enough. I don't have enough talent, so I give you all the hatred I have for myself. I use it all to hate you. The lower the level, the more they like to slander, envy, and sabotage each other. Because they are not good, they don't let you be good. They can't bear to see you live a happy life. To satisfy their fragile vanity, such people will only make their way narrower and narrower. [Jealousy is like a knife, hurting others and eventually hurting yourself] I have read such a story: There was a man who usually got along well with his neighbor. But they quarreled over a trivial matter and became separated. One day, he met a fairy. The fairy pulled him aside and said to him: What is your wish? You can tell me what you want, and I will fulfill it for you. But no matter what you wish for, your neighbor will get double. The man couldn't help but start calculating in his mind: If I want one house, my neighbor will get two. If I want If the neighbor gets 100 million, he will get 200 million. How can he live better than me? So he couldn't wait to make a wish to the gods: "I want you to blind one of my eyes! " The stupidity of human nature is nothing more than jealousy. When others are better off than you, you try every possible way to destroy them, but in the end, you are the one who gets hurt. In the Qing Dynasty, there was a famous martial artist named Bai Taiguan. He saw a child practicing martial arts and became jealous. He was afraid that his position would be lost in the future, so he killed the child. However, he never thought that the child was himself. The son finally regretted and was filled with grief. Once upon a time there was a potter The laundryman next door was jealous of the good business and wanted to trick the king into telling him that he could wash a black elephant into a white one. But the laundryman turned the tables on him and told the king that he had to make a pottery basin that could hold an elephant within three days. Because he could not make it, he was ordered to be executed by the king. There is a saying: People who love flowers can always smell the fragrance of flowers; people who secretly plant thorns will eventually be hurt by the thorns. Life is not a game where you can only win or lose. Everyone Everyone has his own runway. Those who cannot bear to see others do well are often the first to ruin themselves. Those who truly wish others well will be rewarded by fate. To help others is to help yourself. As the old saying goes: Excellent people Stupid people lift each other up and step on each other. The more outstanding and higher-level people are, the better they know how to build bridges with each other. I remember a very impressive fable about a young man who asked God: What is the difference between heaven and hell? God smiled and took him to visit these two places. When he visited hell, a group of people sat in a circle under the dim light. Everyone had a long spoon in their hands, but because the handle was too long, although there was A big bowl of meat soup, but I couldn't even use a spoon to get the soup to my mouth. I could only watch helplessly. I was so hungry that I was skinny and dying, but I didn't even get a sip of the meat soup. But heaven was a different scene. Each of them has a long spoon, but they use this long spoon to send the meat soup to the mouth of the person opposite them. Everyone can share the meat soup. Therefore, everyone in heaven eats the meat soup with a rosy glow on their face and is extremely satisfied. The truly wise know that each other Support is the greatest accomplishment. Xiong Hao once said in "The Rap of China" The reason why heaven is heaven is because: tiny lights attract tiny lights, tiny lights illuminate tiny lights, we find each other and shine together, and this is how we can illuminate the haze. No one is an island that can be self-sufficient. People help each other and build bridges for each other to have a smooth road. While helping others, you are also helping yourself. Lu Xun once said: The brave man draws his sword against the stronger one in anger; the cowardly man draws his sword against the stronger one in anger. The knife is aimed at the weaker one. People who are jealous and can't stand others' good are cowards. Wherever they go is hell. People who know how to help each other and have good intentions are wise. They know that many hands make light work. As the old saying goes: saving yourself is a skill. Helping others is a kind of pattern.
