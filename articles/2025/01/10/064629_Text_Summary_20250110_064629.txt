Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Problem Statement:**

*   The rise of small-scale, distributed solar generation (DSG) necessitates accurate site-adaptive forecasting models.
*   Traditional methods, requiring individual models per DSG, are not economically feasible due to numerous DSGs and limited historical data.

**II. Proposed Solution:**

*   Adapt a state-of-the-art attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model, named Solar TFT (STFT).
*   Validate the generalizability of the self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting using 188 real-world DSG datasets.

**III. Experimental Results:**

*   STFT demonstrated significant improvements compared to persistence model: 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively.
*   STFT outperformed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model: 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively.
*   STFT shows better performance during high variability weather conditions, especially transition periods.

**IV. Key Considerations:**

*   STFT has a more complex architecture and higher computational cost compared to other models.
*   The trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational efficiency is important for practical applications.

**V. Core Point:**

*   The adapted Solar TFT model leverages self-attention to achieve superior forecasting accuracy for distributed solar generation, particularly in unseen scenarios, despite its higher computational cost.

**VI. Fundamental Point:**

*   This study validates the generalizability of self-attention mechanisms in addressing challenges of forecasting for numerous, geographically distributed and data-sparse power generation units.

**VII. Overarching Framework:**

The overarching framework of this work revolves around adapting and validating advanced deep learning techniques, specifically attention-based models like the Temporal Fusion Transformer, to address the practical limitations of traditional forecasting methods for distributed solar generation. It emphasizes the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency while demonstrating the efficacy of the adapted model for accurate forecasts, particularly under variable conditions.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
