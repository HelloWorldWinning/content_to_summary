Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Introduction to Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting:**
    *   Goal: Estimate future probabilistic distributions based on past time series data.
    *   Application: Crucial for risk management and decision making.
    *   Challenge: Time series data is often irregular and noisy due to unknown and complicated real-world processes.

2.  **State Space Models (SSM) as a Framework:**
    *   SSMs offer a general framework for analyzing temporal patterns.
    *   Variants of SSM have achieved success in various fields.
    *   Limitation: Difficulty in determining an SSM for complex real-world scenarios.

3.  **Deep Non-linear State Space Model (DNLSSM) Proposal:**
    *   Approach: Fusion of deep neural networks and statistical methods for time series analysis.
    *   Methodology: Iterative estimation of states and network parameters to exploit complex temporal patterns.
    *   Core Component: Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for recursive calculation of marginal likelihoods and distribution updates, handling non-linear functions.

4.  **Enhancements to UKF in DNLSSM:**
    *   Issue: UKF covariance matrix calculation can be prone to errors (symmetric, positive definite matrices).
    *   Solution: Development of a non-linear Joseph form covariance update.
    *   Benefit: Increased tolerance to round-off errors and stable UKF operation when combined with deep neural networks.

5.  **DNLSSM Effectiveness:**
    *   Capability: Successfully models non-linear correlations between observed data and underlying dynamic processes.
    *   Empirical Results: DNLSSM consistently outperforms baseline methods in accuracy, based on synthetic and real-world datasets.

**Core Point:** DNLSSM effectively improves probabilistic time series forecasting by integrating deep neural networks with an enhanced Unscented Kalman Filter to model complex, non-linear temporal patterns.

**Fundamental Point:** The fusion of deep learning with statistical methods allows for more accurate probabilistic time series forecasting by overcoming the limitations of traditional state space models in complex real-world scenarios.

**Overarching Framework:** The content introduces a novel approach, DNLSSM, for time series forecasting. This approach is built on the foundation of State Space Models (SSM) but addresses its limitations using Deep Neural Networks and an enhanced Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF).

Content:
Probabilistic time series forecasting aims at estimating future probabilistic distributions based on given time series observations. It is a widespread challenge in various tasks, such as risk management and decision making. To investigate temporal patterns in time series data and predict subsequent probabilities, the state space model (SSM) provides a general framework. Variants of SSM achieve considerable success in many fields, such as engineering and statistics. However, since underlying processes in real-world scenarios are usually unknown and complicated, actual time series observations are always irregular and noisy. Therefore, it is very difficult to determinate an SSM for classical statistical approaches. In this paper, a general time series forecasting framework, called Deep Non-linear State Space Model (DNLSSM), is proposed to predict the probabilistic distribution based on estimated underlying unknown processes from historical time series data. We fuse deep neural networks and statistical methods to iteratively estimate states and network parameters and thus exploit intricate temporal patterns of time series data. In particular, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is adopted to calculate marginal likelihoods and update distributions recursively for non-linear functions. After that, a non-linear Joseph form covariance update is developed to ensure that calculated covariance matrices in UKF updates are symmetric and positive definitive. Therefore, the authors enhance the tolerance of UKF to round-off errors and manage to combine UKF and deep neural networks. In this manner, the DNLSSM effectively models non-linear correlations between observed time series data and underlying dynamic processes. Experiments in both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the DNLSSM consistently improves the accuracy of probability forecasts compared to the baseline methods.
