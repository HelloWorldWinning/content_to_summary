Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   Small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) is increasing.
    *   Accurate forecasting for unseen DSGs is needed.
    *   Traditional methods requiring individual models per DSG are not feasible.

2.  **Problem:**
    *   Lack of historical data for many new DSGs.
    *   Need for a generalized forecasting approach.

3.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Adapting the attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model.
    *   Applying it to 188 real-world DSG datasets.
    *   Validating the self-attention mechanism's generalizability.

4.  **Results:**
    *   The Solar TFT (STFT) outperforms persistence models significantly, especially at longer forecast horizons (10, 20, and 30 minutes).
    *   STFT also achieves better accuracy compared to deep-learning models like LSTM at various forecast intervals.
    *   STFT performs well during weather transitions and high variability periods where other models lag.

5. **Trade-offs:**
    *   STFT has higher computational cost and model complexity compared to alternatives.
    *   Practical application needs to balance accuracy and efficiency.

6.  **Weather Condition Analysis:**
    *   Evaluated under clear, partly cloudy, and overcast conditions.
    *   STFT showed better forecast accuracy under all three conditions but especially during high variability conditions such as weather transition periods.

**Core Point:** The self-attention mechanism of the adapted Temporal Fusion Transformer (STFT) demonstrates generalizable improvement in multi-step time series forecasting for unseen distributed solar generation (DSG), outperforming persistence and LSTM models, especially during weather transitions.

**Fundamental Point:** Adapting advanced machine learning models like TFT offers a viable solution for forecasting solar power generation in distributed settings without extensive historical data, but one must account for complexity and computational trade-offs.

**Overarching Framework:**

The content presents a problem-solution-evaluation framework, focusing on the challenges of forecasting power output for numerous small-scale urban DSG installations where historical data is sparse. It proposes adapting the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model, evaluates its performance, and analyzes its effectiveness under diverse weather conditions, providing insights into the modelâ€™s strengths and limitations.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
