Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   The rise of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) necessitates accurate site-adaptive forecasting for unseen DSGs.
    *   Traditional methods of building individual models for each DSG are not cost-effective due to the large number of DSGs and lack of historical data.

2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Adapt the attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to create a Solar TFT (STFT) model.
    *   Validate the generalizability of the self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting using 188 real-world DSG datasets.
    *   Focus on the capability to adapt the trained model to predict power output for unseen DSGs without retraining.

3.  **Results:**
    *   STFT significantly outperforms the persistence model, with improvements of 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively.
    *   STFT also outperforms the LSTM model, showing improvements of 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% at the same forecast horizons.
    *   STFT demonstrates its strength in high-variability periods, particularly during weather transitions.

4.  **Limitations:**
    *   The STFT model is more complex and computationally more expensive than other deep learning models.
    *   There's a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency to be considered.

5. **Weather Condition Analysis:**
  * STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.

**Core Point:** A single Solar Temporal Fusion Transformer (STFT) model, leveraging the self-attention mechanism, demonstrates significant and generalizable improvements in forecasting power output for unseen distributed solar generation (DSG) locations compared to both persistence and LSTM models.

**Fundamental Point:**  The application of advanced deep learning techniques, specifically self-attention mechanisms, offers a feasible approach to address the challenge of cost-effective and accurate power output prediction for widely distributed solar generation systems, even when data is scarce.

**Overarching Framework:**
The study uses a sophisticated deep-learning architecture (TFT/STFT) to tackle the forecasting problem for Distributed Solar Generation, emphasizing adaptation to unseen scenarios, which is a major hurdle in the field, and comparing performance against established forecasting models.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
