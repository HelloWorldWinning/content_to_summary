Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   The rise of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) necessitates accurate forecasting for individual DSGs.
    *   Traditional methods requiring individual models for each DSG are not feasible due to a lack of historical data and the large number of DSGs.

2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Adapt the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model, utilizing its self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting, for distributed solar power generation.
    *   The adapted model is named Solar TFT (STFT).

3.  **Results:**
    *   STFT improves forecast accuracy significantly compared to the persistence model, especially at longer forecast horizons.
    *   STFT outperforms representative deep learning models like LSTM for time series forecasting, particularly at multi-step forecasts (10-minute, 20-minute, and 30-minute predictions).
    *   STFT demonstrates improved performance in high variability periods, especially during weather transitions.

4.  **Trade-offs:**
    *   STFT has higher computational cost and is more complex compared to other deep learning models, thus a trade off between accuracy and computational efficiency must be considered.

5.  **Weather Condition Analysis:**
    * STFT is tested under three weather conditions, clear, partly cloudy and overcast.

6. **Key points in Performance:**
   * STFT excels in high variability conditions compared with traditional deep-learning and persistence model, especially during weather transitions where reference model exhibits prediction lag.

**Core Point:** The Solar TFT (STFT) model, adapted from the Temporal Fusion Transformer, achieves superior multi-step forecasting accuracy for distributed solar generation (DSG) compared to traditional and deep learning models, highlighting the advantages of its self-attention mechanism.

**Fundamental Point:**  Employing advanced deep learning techniques such as attention mechanisms, when adapted correctly, can overcome limitations of conventional approaches when applied to complex forecasting challenges such as those arising from the increasing prevalence of urban distributed solar generation, especially when there is lack of historical data.

**Overarching Framework:**
This research explores a novel application of a sophisticated deep learning model (TFT) to address the forecasting challenges of distributed solar generation. It focuses on the need for site-adaptive models given the abundance of DSG and lack of historical data; it uses transfer learning through the self-attention mechanism to adapt the TFT to solar data; and then validates its performance against established baseline and deep learning techniques.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
