Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   The rise of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) necessitates accurate power output forecasts.
    *   Traditional approaches, which develop individual models for each DSG, are not economically feasible due to the vast number of DSGs and lack of historical data.

2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Adapt a state-of-the-art, attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to predict DSG power output.
    *   The adapted model, named Solar TFT (STFT), is evaluated using 188 real-world DSG datasets.
    *   The goal is to demonstrate the generalizability of the self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting in unseen DSGs.

3.  **Results:**
    *   STFT significantly outperforms a persistence model, showing improvements of 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively.
    *   STFT also surpasses a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the same horizons.
    *   STFT is particularly effective during periods of high variability and weather transitions, mitigating lagged predictions seen in other models.

4.  **Limitations:**
    *   STFT has a more complex architecture than other deep learning models, leading to higher computational costs.
    *   This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency needs consideration for real-world applications.

5. **Weather Analysis**:
    *  The forecast performance of STFT is analyzed under clear, partly cloudy, and overcast weather conditions.
    *  STFT demonstrates superior forecasting especially during weather transitions.

**Core Point:** The Solar Temporal Fusion Transformer (STFT), by leveraging the self-attention mechanism, provides superior forecasting accuracy for distributed solar generation (DSG), especially in unseen sites, compared to traditional and other deep-learning methods, albeit at a higher computational cost.

**Fundamental Point:**  Attention-based deep learning models, particularly the TFT, can be effectively adapted to generalize across diverse time-series forecasting tasks, even with limited or no historical data, such as in the emerging field of distributed solar generation.

**Overarching Framework:** The research addresses the challenges of forecasting power output for distributed solar generation by adapting a state-of-the-art deep learning model and testing its generalization capability using real-world data, ultimately aiming to provide a solution applicable to new DSGs.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
