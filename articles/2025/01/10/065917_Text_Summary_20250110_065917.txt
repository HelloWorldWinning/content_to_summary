Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Core Idea:**
    *   The paper addresses the challenge of forecasting power output for numerous small-scale, distributed solar generation (DSG) sites in urban areas, where individual models for each DSG are impractical due to a lack of historical data.
    *   It proposes and validates the use of a self-attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model, named Solar TFT (STFT), to adapt to unseen DSGs.
    *   The STFT model demonstrates improved forecasting accuracy compared to persistence and other deep learning models like LSTM.
    *   The paper also analyzes the performance of STFT under different weather conditions, emphasizing its strength in variable conditions.
2.  **STFT Model Performance:**
    *   **Against Persistence Model:** STFT improves forecast accuracy by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts.
    *   **Against LSTM Model:** STFT improves forecast accuracy by 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons.
3.  **Trade-offs and Weather Conditions:**
    *   STFT exhibits higher computational costs due to its complex architecture.
    *   STFT shows superior performance during weather transition periods when compared to the reference models, highlighting its strength under variability.
4.  **Core Point:** The study demonstrates that the self-attention mechanism in the adapted STFT model provides a generalizable approach for multi-step forecasting of DSG power output, particularly when historical data is scarce.
5.  **Fundamental Point:** The self-attention mechanism of the STFT architecture provides a powerful tool for accurate and adaptable time-series forecasting of solar power generation across numerous distributed sites, proving effective even with minimal historical data.
6.  **Overarching Framework:**  The research adopts an **application-driven approach** to tackle real-world challenges related to renewable energy forecasting with the use of advanced machine learning techniques, showcasing the potential of the STFT in overcoming the practical limitations of conventional methods for distributed solar generation.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
