Description:
**Summary:**

**1. Core Ideas:**
    *   **Problem:** The increasing number of small-scale, urban distributed solar generation (DSG) sites requires accurate power output forecasting, but conventional methods are costly due to the lack of historical data for each site.
    *   **Solution:** The study adapts the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model, calling it Solar TFT (STFT), to forecast power output for unseen DSGs, leveraging the self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting.
    *   **Results:** STFT shows improved accuracy over persistence and LSTM models, especially during high variability weather conditions and transition periods. However, STFT has a higher computational cost.
    *   **Weather Analysis:**  The study analyzes performance under clear, partly cloudy, and overcast conditions, revealing STFT's strength in handling weather transitions.

**2. Core Point:**
   The study validates the adaptability of a self-attention-based STFT model for improved multi-step time series forecasting of DSG power output, even with limited site-specific historical data.

**3. Fundamental Point:**
  The study demonstrates a trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational cost when applying advanced deep learning models for distributed solar generation forecasting.

**4. Overarching Framework:**
   The study framework includes:
      1. Identifying the need for site-adaptive forecasting models for numerous, data-scarce DSGs.
      2. Adapting the TFT model to create STFT, with a focus on self-attention for time-series prediction.
      3. Validating STFTâ€™s performance against benchmarks (persistence and LSTM) across different forecast horizons and weather conditions.
      4. Analyzing the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost of the STFT model.
      5. Concluding with the benefits and challenges of applying such complex models in practice.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
