Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   Small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) requires accurate power output forecasting.
    *   Conventional methods, which develop individual models for each DSG, are not viable due to numerous DSGs and limited historical data.
    *   The challenge is to forecast power for unseen DSGs without prior training data.

2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Adapt the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model for solar power forecasting (STFT).
    *   Leverage the self-attention mechanism of TFT for multi-step time series forecasting.

3.  **Experimental Validation:**
    *   Validated on 188 real-world operational DSG data.
    *   STFT significantly outperforms the persistence model (11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% improvement at 10, 20, and 30 minutes respectively).
    *   STFT demonstrates better accuracy than LSTM (3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at 10, 20, and 30 minutes respectively).

4.  **Trade-offs:**
    *   STFT has higher computational costs than other deep learning models due to its complex architecture.
    *   There is a trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational efficiency, which needs consideration.

5.  **Weather Condition Analysis:**
    *   STFT shows its edge especially during weather transition periods and high variability.
    *   Reference models have lagged predictions during these periods.

**Core Point:** The study successfully adapts the TFT model (STFT) to accurately forecast power outputs for unseen DSGs, outperforming both persistence models and traditional deep learning techniques, particularly during volatile weather conditions.

**Fundamental Point:** Leveraging the self-attention mechanism within a modified TFT model provides a powerful way to handle the challenge of forecasting power output for numerous unseen distributed solar generation sources with limited historical data.

**Overarching Framework:**  The overarching framework is a study of adapting and validating a deep-learning based time series forecasting technique, specifically the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), for the problem of distributed solar generation power forecasting for unseen sites. This approach provides a generalizable model for practical urban settings, effectively handling the challenge of limited data and varied weather conditions.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
