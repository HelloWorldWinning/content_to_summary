Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Introduction:**
    *   The video analyzes a trading strategy using MACD divergence, popularized by a well-known figure (Demigod) in the crypto space.
    *   The strategy was claimed to achieve a 95% win rate and 420% return in a manual backtest.
    *   The video aims to quantify this strategy using backtesting to verify its claimed performance.

**II. Strategy Overview:**
    *   **Core Idea:** Identifies top-bottom divergences between price and MACD columns for trading signals.
    *   **MACD:** Uses the MACD column; looks for larger (quantified as a multiple) differences between consecutive peaks/troughs for valid divergence.
    *  **Parameters:** MACD (13, 34, 9), ATR (13) – These parameters are used in original video, but are not necessarily recommendations of presenter.
    *   **ATR:** Used to determine stop loss level, set at the ATR value from the high (short) or low (long) of the signal bar.
    *   **Timeframe:** The strategy is applied on the 15-minute Bitcoin chart.

**III. Issues with the Original Strategy Implementation:**
    *   **Ambiguity:** The original strategy relies on “feeling” the divergence, which is difficult to quantify.
    *   **Entry Point:** The entry price was problematic; it is not based on the closing price of the K bar when the condition is satisfied.
    *   **Stop Loss:** Stop loss price was pulled from an unconfirmed lowest/highest point of the k-bar.
    *   **Profit-Loss Ratio:** The real profit-loss ratio in practice will be significantly lower than in the original manual backtest due to transaction costs (fees, spreads).
    *   **Manual vs. Quantitative:** Manual backtesting often neglects transaction costs and may overstate results.

**IV. Quantitative Backtesting and Findings:**
    *   **Rules Clarification**: The video clarifies how the parameters are used (e.g. multiple for divergence).
    *   **EA (Expert Advisor):** The presenter created an EA with adjustable parameters (e.g., stop-loss, profit target, divergence multiple, reverse bars).
    *   **Backtesting Results:** The backtested results, when accounting for more practical entry and stop loss points, along with transaction costs, do not replicate the high performance of the original manual backtest.
    *   **Core Logic Test:** The quantitative backtest showed that even the core underlying logic of the strategy was not profitable, making additional features irrelevant.

**V. Conclusion:**
    *   The core underlying logic of the strategy (identifying price trend weakening with MACD divergence) needs to be profitable.
    *   The Demigod likely combines this strategy with other tools and deep knowledge of the market.
    *   Reliance on a single strategy ("Holy Grail") is not sufficient for long-term profit.
    *   Traders should aim for a combination of factors and have an overall strategy.
    *   The presenter advocates for quantitative backtesting over manual to better represent real-world conditions and strategy profitability

**VI. Core Point:** A trading strategy's underlying logic must be validated quantitatively to be deemed effective before adding additional complexities and should be combined with overall strategy thinking, not as single Holy Grail.

**VII. Fundamental Point:** Manual backtesting often overestimates strategy performance due to the neglect of transaction costs, unlike quantitative testing, which reveals actual limitations of strategy effectiveness.

**VIII. Overarching Framework:**
    The content is structured as an analysis and validation of a specific trading strategy, transitioning from a critique of the subjective elements of the original method to an implementation and evaluation based on quantitative backtesting to determine profitability. The process follows a logical structure, progressing from understanding the strategy, to identifying its flaws, to developing a quantitative approach, finally evaluating the effectiveness of the underlying logic.

**IX. Conceptual Map:**

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en Hey, he's here. Today he's back with a very strong trading system. Hello everyone, I'm Algolee. Today we're going to verify a trading strategy shared by the demigod in the currency circle. His set of MACD trading methods with a very high winning rate. The channel of this speculative laboratory summarized his method and manually backtested it. He manually backtested it for 177 days with a winning rate of 95% and a rate of return of 420%. This has quadrupled. This year, it is not easily 10 times. If this income is placed in the peak period of the demigod, I really believe that the old man of Biqiang should know that the demigod started with a few thousand dollars. At his peak, the income was more than 400 times. However, he has spoken less in the public media recently. The content he shared should be his prediction of the price of the pie before and after the halving. However, the current price of the pie is still quite different from his prediction, but it doesn’t matter. We summarized it based on the speculation laboratory today. Based on his trading rules, let’s quantify Demigod’s strategy based on the rules in his video to see if it has such a big profit effect. This video is the most popular video on his channel and currently has 460, 000 views. It seems that many people really pay attention to and like the MACD strategy of Demigod. I still follow the old rules. I will put the quantified Demigod macdea on the network disk. You can download it and make your own. A backtest of these trading varieties. All you have to do is make a joke hit my follow button. The transaction cost like this guy. I still like this speculative laboratory. of these videos His videos are more comfortable to watch. His special effects are much better than what I can do. This is the strategy I want to learn. It uses two indicators. One is our MACD. What we mainly use is its column. That is, when the market volatility intensifies, the peak of the MACD column is It will increase. When the market becomes sluggish, the MACD column will also shrink. This trading system is to look for the top and bottom divergence of MACD to make this order signal. Here is one thing that everyone needs to pay attention to. It is necessary. Look for divergences with large differences in wave peaks. Please pay attention to the word "larger", which means that the difference between your two consecutive wave peaks and their MACD columns must be larger. Only then can it meet the conditions for placing an order. It does not mean that all This divergence will open a position. For example, if the peak of the column here is here and then another peak is here, if the ratio between their peaks is defined as twice, then your order cannot be opened. If If you set it to 1. 2 times, it may still meet the conditions for opening a position. As for the specific parameters of MACD, this speculation laboratory uses 1334 and 9. Note that all the parameters I listed here, including the ATR here, are all original. The use of it in the video does not mean that I agree with it. Another indicator is our ATR indicator. The parameter of ATR is used. The original video should use 13, not 14. 14 is the default parameter of this ATR. Its main function is to use When calculating the stop loss point, we assume that when we assume that this order is at this bar, this order signal is generated. Then if we enter the market at this position, our stop loss needs to be set at a distance from its highest price. The ATR value of its highest price, then our stop loss price needs to be fixed from here, that is, the ATR value here should probably be at this position as its stop loss price. Well, let's take a look at the original video again. How he uses these two indicators is a specific operational detail of this strategy. It is used in the opening condition of the 15-minute chart of Bitcoin. It is when the MACD column forms a top-bottom divergence, that is, when our The peak of the price above us shows an upward trend, but the peak of MACD shows a downward trend. In this case, it satisfies the conditions for short selling here. On the contrary, when our MACD is trending upward, but the low point of our price is gradually going downward, so this meets one of our long conditions. In addition, I watched the original video to judge this top-bottom divergence. I think it is still One problem is that it uses the first MACD of the turning point as the confirmation condition. I personally don’t agree with this because if you look at the chart like this, it is really obvious because the market has moved out and you can see the divergence. But when the market has not moved, It’s actually hard to see when it’s finished. If you just use the first MACD turning point, it’s considered a divergence. Then this kind of divergence is too much. If you memorize it, you still have to memorize it. Well, I saw this comment in the original video. Many people in the district have reported this question. Yuan Bozhong’s answer is that it depends on the specific feeling. To be honest, I feel that this thing is ambiguous. Don’t say it between people because they have different experiences and have different feelings about the chart. Even if you are the same person, Personally, if you look back at the same chart form today and next month, your feelings will be different. So when we do quantification, we cannot say that we open positions in this form. We can only open positions when the market trend at least wants it. After taking out a few bars, we can judge whether it meets Bebe's conditions. This is our opening position and the key to stop loss is to use the lowest and highest points of k minus the corresponding ATR value. If we only win, we use it. The fixed profit and loss ratio in the original video is 1: 2 as he said in the comment area. If the conditions are met, we will open a position at the key K position. Another problem I have with the original video demonstration is that the entry point he demonstrated is actually It feels a bit like this future function, because even if you use the first MACD bar, um, turning bar to enter the market, then under such conditions, you should use the closing price of this K bar to enter the market instead of this bar. The opening price of k is the key to use when entering the market and stopping loss. The lowest point of k is the key. In addition, the corresponding ATR is used as a stop loss. Even if you use the first key K, this key K has not finished yet. Then you have no way to confirm this lowest point, including your entry price. It’s not quite right, so I’ll just focus on this case. The real situation is that your entry price will be pulled up a lot, and your stop loss will be pulled down even more. If you add in the handling fees, overnight fees, and spreads, For these normal transaction costs, the profit-loss ratio of your transaction may be much, much less than the 8. 7 times he gave the example here. And normally we have no way to say that every transaction is even at such a low level. The perfect point, for example, the same logic applies to the short order here. You have to wait for the price to move away before you can determine it, so the entry price here should be the closing price of the negative line. There is also another problem, which is to add After adding in normal transaction costs such as handling fees, overnight fees and spreads, even if you calculate your profit and loss ratio at such a perfect closing point, your profit and loss ratio will still be much less. This is also a very important factor in the thinking of manual traders and quantitative traders. The big gap is mostly reflected in this review. Manual traders basically rarely consider this transaction cost issue when reviewing reviews. At least, many videos show that this transaction cost is not considered very much. However, in fact, the impact of cost on a strategy It 's really big. Even if you follow certain fixed methods to extract the corresponding transaction costs, the performance you get from manual backtesting will be much, much better than the real performance from quantitative backtesting. I recall that many years ago, I was involved in a set of one-minute trading strategies. I spent a lot of time on this. At that time, I was doing manual trading. I spent a long time on manual review and review for more than ten times. It took me a lot of time to track the price of the species in the past five or six years. After the backtesting was completed, I thought that actually has a huge impact. I would fix the final result and subtract the corresponding handling fee from the official platform. But even so, I backtested The effect of this report is still very good, but after I started trading for a period of time, I found that it was not like this. There are many transaction costs that you cannot calculate by just looking at a chart. Let’s just talk about spreads. If you look at the chart, you have no way of knowing what the spread is at this moment. If you do foreign exchange guidance, if you have no spread and no handling fees, then you will definitely make a profit. So I also give advice to many people. If you think your transaction The strategy can really be profitable, so please take the time to write it as quantitatively as possible and conduct backtesting as scientifically as possible. Some people may say that there are many rules for quantification. There is no way to determine my strategy. I need to identify it with my naked eyes. This is true, but if a If the strategy is really effective, then it must have a relatively core and relatively low-level trading logic. The quantification in it can help us backtest whether the underlying logic is effective. If the strategy needs to combine those edges and corners, If it can achieve a profitable effect, then I personally think that its true profit situation needs to be greatly discounted, which is questionable. Just like the current trading strategy, its core underlying logic is whether a trend of recent price movements has weakened. It is the core of this strategy. What we want to test is the profit effect of this core. If the most profound condition that affects this strategy cannot achieve the profit effect, then there is no need to consider other trivial matters. Now that we have some conditions, this is a complete trading rule for this strategy. Next, let’s take a look at the specific details based on the market. First, let’s look at this place. The green line represents a long signal because a price and MACD are formed. A divergence from top to bottom, and the column here is calculated based on 1. 5 times the original strategy, so it should be satisfied here. Then we will enter and exit the market at this K to place an order. Why is it here? Root K does not mean this root K. It does not mean this root K. Because at the time of this root k, your market has not actually improved yet. If you do it at this root, then why don’t you do it at this root as well. So we You must be more rigorous when backtesting. The effect of this stone disk is different from what you see with the naked eye. If we look further ahead, if we look at a little red, it represents a bearish signal, but it does not mean that all red lines All meet the status of a divergence. Only if you make a transaction, and only if I have a transaction here, will it be considered a logical divergence. For example, if this price goes up, the MACD column goes down, and the value of the peak It is 1. 5 times the peak of this wave and there is no reverse column in the middle, so it satisfies a divergence state. We place an order here and eventually get damaged. Then if this area deviates from this area, this divergence also satisfies a condition for going long. It's a pity that it was damaged in the end. Looking at the shape here, it satisfies the distance. However, we see that the distance between the wave crest here and the wave crest here does not meet our requirement of 1. 5 times, so we cannot place an order. Well, go ahead. If you look at it from the front, it is also the same here. There are inverse directions between the two wave peaks, and there are many inverse columns. So it also does not satisfy the state of a top-bottom Bailey. If it is included here, it is most likely to be this. The ratio between the wave peak and this wave peak is less than 1. 5 times, so he can't place an order if he is not satisfied. If he is satisfied here, he is also satisfied here. Only when the difference between the peaks is large, we think it is a reasonable Bailey, but it is a pity. The thing is that our place is still damaged, and then we don’t look at it. Next, we run it completely and look at a complete one. What does this capital curve look like? Is it profitable? The original strategy was backtested from January 21 to April 22. Here, we will use May 24 from 21 to now for the backtest. We use the 15-minute chart of Bitcoin to test. Then before we backtest, I will introduce to you the specific use of this EA, which is the meaning of these parameters. First of all, these 3 should go without saying. These two are specific stop losses. If you choose the method 1 and 100, it means that you are using a method that can lose up to 100 US dollars for each order. Then here is a single cycle. If we do it according to the 15 minutes here, then I will see the specific profit and loss ratio. The comment area of ​​the original video uses double, so I will use 2 here. If the stop loss is used, a divergence detection k is used. This actually represents a value. As long as this value is smaller, the times you detect will be There will be more, but correspondingly, it may deviate from our conventional understanding of this multiple, so try to set it more reasonably. But if it is larger, the deviation you detect will be smaller, and the number of transactions will be very small. Another disadvantage of this strategy is that its number of transactions is really small. Especially if you are looking for such a deviation with a relatively large gap between wave peaks, then there are really few requirements for the original strategy here. The rule is 1. 5 times. If you write one, it means there is no requirement. As long as there is such a deviation, the conditions are met. But according to the meaning of the demigod, the greater the difference, the higher your winning rate. But I suggest that it is still set. It's reasonable, because if it is too high, the magnification you will still detect will be smaller. And what does it mean if there are the most reverse bars here? For example, take here as an example. For example, after a divergence is formed here, if these middle If some of the columns in this area run up to the top, that is, above the zero axis, sometimes we will actually regard them as meeting a deviation condition with the naked eye. But if you want to be stricter, you can put it Set to 0, which means that you cannot have any column appearing above the zero axis, but in this case, your detected multiple will be less. Then there are the parameters of MACD, fast line and slow line, as well as the signal used by the original strategy. It is 1334 9. Then the ATR uses 13. Well, these are all the parameters. Let’s backtest it specifically to see the effect. This is the real performance of this strategy. In fact, it is not much different from what I imagined. Of course, this is speculation. In the laboratory, he probably didn’t mean to show you a better backtest result because his (referring to the strategy) real backtest has a lot of transaction costs, including his entry point, as demonstrated by the original blogger. There are also some small problems that may cause the performance of his backtest to be too good. In fact, many strategies are like this. If you don’t add transaction costs, your performance will be very good. But with such a perfect backtest environment, it is in our real offer. It didn't exist at that time, and I think this Demigod's trading strategy. I have also seen some of the content he shared before. When Demigod makes orders, he doesn't just rely on the top-bottom divergence of MACD to make orders. If old people in the currency circle have watched some of his videos, they will know that he uses many, many trading indicators. To be honest, his board is densely packed with many indicators and combined with his personal knowledge of the currency circle to create it. His profit of 400 times, well, this is actually what I often say, which is that you can't always think about finding a set of Holy Grails and then just make money. What you need to do is to have a combination, a combination, and an overall thinking about the problem. If you always think about a sure-profit trading method and then eat it for the rest of your life, it is unlikely to be good. This is what I want to share today. I will not backtest the other trading varieties. If you are interested, you can download it yourself. Then do your own backtest. If the video is helpful to you, please like, comment and follow us. See you in the next video. Bye,
