Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Challenge:**
    *   The increasing adoption of small-scale distributed solar generation (DSG) necessitates accurate site-adaptive forecasting models.
    *   Traditional methods, which build individual models for each DSG, are not economically viable due to the large number of DSGs and limited historical data.

2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Adapt the attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to solar power forecasting (STFT).
    *   Validate the generalizability of the self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting across 188 real-world operational DSGs.

3.  **Results:**
    *   STFT significantly outperforms the persistence model (11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% improvement at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts).
    *   STFT outperforms a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model specialized in time series forecasting (3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% improvement at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons).
    *   STFT performs well under various weather conditions (clear, partly cloudy, overcast) but excels especially during weather transitions.

4.  **Trade-offs:**
    *   STFT offers higher forecast accuracy.
    *   STFT has a more complex architecture and higher computational cost compared to other deep learning models.

**Core Point:** The study demonstrates the effectiveness of adapting the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model for accurate multi-step solar power forecasting in distributed generation scenarios, showcasing its superior performance over conventional and deep learning models.

**Fundamental Point:** The research highlights the trade-off between forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency when employing advanced deep learning models for distributed solar generation, underscoring the need for a balanced approach in practical applications.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
