Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Core Problem:**

*   The rise of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) requires accurate site-adaptive forecasting models.
*   Developing individual models for each DSG is not economically feasible due to the large number of DSGs and limited historical data.

**II. Proposed Solution:**

*   Adapt the attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model for multi-step time series forecasting of DSG power output.
*   The proposed solar TFT (STFT) model aims to improve generalization to unseen DSGs without needing training data specific to each site.

**III. Experimental Results:**

*   STFT outperforms the persistence model by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively.
*   STFT outperforms a long short-term memory (LSTM) model by 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% at the same forecast horizons.
*   STFT demonstrates improved performance, particularly during periods with high weather variability and transitions.

**IV. Trade-Offs:**

*   STFTâ€™s model architecture is more complex.
*   STFT has a higher computational cost compared to other models.

**V. Performance Analysis:**

*   STFT's performance was analyzed across clear, partly cloudy, and overcast weather conditions.
*   STFT shows improved accuracy particularly in periods of high variability such as weather transitions.

**VI. Core Point:** The attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer model demonstrates significant potential for accurate and generalized forecasting of distributed solar generation, even for unseen sites, by leveraging the self-attention mechanism to improve multi-step time-series predictions.

**VII. Fundamental Point:** The need for scalable and accurate forecasting solutions for distributed renewable energy sources necessitates the development of adaptable models, such as the proposed STFT, capable of generalizing to unseen instances without the need for extensive individual training data.

**VIII. Overarching Framework:** The work is based on a machine learning methodology that addresses the challenges associated with time-series forecasting in the domain of distributed solar generation by adapting and testing a state of art attention-based model.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
