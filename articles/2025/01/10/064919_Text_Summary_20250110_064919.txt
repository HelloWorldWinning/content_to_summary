Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Challenge:**
    *   Small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) requires accurate site-adaptive forecasting models.
    *   Conventional methods, which create individual models for each DSG, are not cost-effective due to numerous DSGs and lack of historical data.

2.  **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Adapt the attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model (named Solar TFT - STFT).
    *   Validate the self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting using 188 real-world operational DSG data.

3.  **Results:**
    *   STFT improves forecast accuracy compared to persistence model by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts respectively when applied to unseen DSGs.
    *   STFT outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model by 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively.
    *   STFT excels during high variability periods, particularly during weather transitions.

4.  **Limitations:**
    *   STFT has higher computational cost and model complexity than other deep learning models.
    *   Trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency needs to be considered.

**Core Point:** The proposed Solar Temporal Fusion Transformer (STFT) model demonstrates improved forecast accuracy for distributed solar generation, especially in high variability conditions, even when applied to unseen datasets without additional training.

**Fundamental Point:**  Self-attention mechanisms within the Temporal Fusion Transformer framework can effectively generalize to various distributed solar generation sites for multi-step time series forecasting, despite limited historical data, but at an increased computational cost.

**Overarching Framework:** The research aims to address the challenge of forecasting power output for distributed solar generation (DSG) by exploring the applicability of attention-based deep learning techniques, specifically the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), to achieve improved accuracy with a self-attention mechanism in scenarios with limited data.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
