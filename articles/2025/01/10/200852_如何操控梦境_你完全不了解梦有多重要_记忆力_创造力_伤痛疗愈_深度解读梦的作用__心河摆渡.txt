**Summary:**

**I. Dreams and Their Functions**

*   **A. The Prevalence of Dreams:**
    *   Humans dream 4-7 times per night, each dream lasting 5-20 minutes.
    *   A person might spend 10 years of their life dreaming.
*   **B. The Science of Dreaming:**
    *   Dreams primarily occur during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, a stage with active brainwaves.
    *   During REM, brain areas linked to vision, movement, emotion, and memory are highly active (even more than when awake).
    *   The brain is not processing external stimuli during dreams but rather internally generated information.
    *   The body is paralyzed during REM sleep to prevent physical acting out of dreams.
*   **C. The Purpose and Benefits of Dreams:**
    *   **Creativity and Problem-Solving:** Dreams provide a different mode of processing information, allowing for new combinations and insights. Historical breakthroughs, such as Mendeleev's periodic table and Kekule's benzene structure, originated in dreams.
    *   **Emotional Regulation:** The brain stops releasing norepinephrine during REM sleep, minimizing anxiety and sadness, and providing a form of emotional healing. Dreams can also help process and practice coping with negative experiences.
    *   **Memory Consolidation:** Dreams aid in the transfer of information from short-term to long-term memory.
*   **D. Lucid Dreaming:**
    *   Lucid dreaming is when one is aware they are dreaming and can potentially control the dream.
    *   It is possible to manipulate actions in lucid dreams, confirmed through brain scans.
    *   Most people don't have the innate ability for lucid dreaming, and methods to induce it are not highly successful.
*   **E. Factors Affecting Dreams:**
    *   Dreams are not entirely random, often following patterns and relating to real-life experiences.
    *   Dreams can be influenced by daily activities and information encountered during the day.
    *   Adequate sleep is crucial for proper dreaming.

**II. The Impact of Pornography on the Brain**

*   **A. Initial Stimulation:**
    *   Pornography triggers dopamine release, activating the brain's reward pathway and creating feelings of pleasure and excitement.
    *   This dopamine-driven experience leads to a desire to repeat the behavior.
*   **B. The Brain's Plasticity and Sensitization:**
    *   The brain becomes sensitized to cues related to pornography, leading to strong desires when encountering these triggers.
    *   Repeated exposure strengthens connections in the brain's desire circuitry.
*   **C. Reduced Reward and Desensitization:**
    *   With frequent viewing, the reward prediction error decreases, resulting in reduced dopamine release and diminished pleasure.
    *   The brain's reward and motivation center (striatum) becomes less active and can even atrophy.
*   **D. The Cycle of Addiction:**
    *   The decrease in pleasure creates a craving to seek even more extreme or novel content.
    *   When expectations aren't met, dopamine levels drop, causing painful withdrawal symptoms.
*   **E. Frontal Lobe Degeneration:**
    *   Pornography addiction can lead to decreased function in the frontal lobe, impairing impulse control and the ability to foresee consequences.
    *   The control circuit weakens, allowing the desire circuit to dominate, leading to impulsive behavior.
*   **F. Negative Impacts on Daily Life:**
    *   Addiction leads to indulgence in instant gratification and a decreased interest in delayed gratification activities like learning and socializing.
    *   Stress-processing parts of the brain malfunction, contributing to a vicious cycle of addiction.
    *   Addiction is associated with male dysfunction and reduced sexual satisfaction in real-life relationships.
*   **G. Recovery:**
    *   Withdrawal symptoms are experienced in the initial phase of quitting, making it difficult to maintain abstinence.
    *   After a few weeks of abstaining, cravings reduce, and attention becomes clearer.
    *   Eventually, pleasure can be derived from more healthy and lasting sources.

**III. The Placebo Effect and Its Power**

*   **A. The Power of Belief:**
    *   The placebo effect demonstrates the power of psychological cues to influence physical well-being.
    *   Placebos can result in positive physiological responses, such as pain relief, even without active ingredients.
    *   Negative psychological cues (nocebos) can lead to negative physiological effects.
*   **B. Mechanisms of Action:**
    *   **Psychological Suggestion:** The unconscious self-protection ability can reduce pain and activate learning processes.
    *   **Endorphin Release:** Thoughts and memories can trigger the release of endorphins, which relieve pain and elevate mood.
    *   **Dopamine Release:** Placebos can trigger dopamine release, influencing mood, desire, and feelings of excitement and happiness.
    *   **Stress and Relaxation Response:** Positive beliefs can promote a relaxation response, counteracting the negative effects of stress hormones.
*   **C. Applying the Placebo Effect:**
    *   **Cultivate Optimism:** Changing a negative outlook to a positive one can have a significant impact on health and longevity.
    *   **Reduce Social Anxiety:** Shift the perception of social interactions as less of a burden to reduce stress and improve well-being.
    *   **Manage Stress:** Employ relaxation techniques like meditation, swimming, or yoga to reduce stress.
    *   **Boost Self-Efficacy:** Visualize success to influence the brain into believing in it, leading to actual success.
*   **D. The Importance of Professional Medical Advice:** While placebos can aid healing, it is crucial to follow medical advice.

**Core Point:** Dreams are a complex and vital function of the brain, playing key roles in creativity, emotional regulation, and memory consolidation; while pornography's effects on the brain highlight the power of dopamine and the dangers of addiction, but the placebo effect showcases the powerful ability of our minds to influence our physical and mental health, emphasizing the importance of positive thinking and self-belief.

**Fundamental Point:** Understanding the brain's functions and plasticity, particularly in response to stimuli and beliefs, is crucial for making informed choices about habits and attitudes that affect our overall well-being.

**Overarching Framework:** The content explores three distinct areas of brain function: dreaming, addiction (specifically to pornography), and the placebo effect. It connects the dots to show the brain's power of influence over our lives. It uses scientific findings and research studies to back up its claims and provides a comprehensive overview that helps to understand the brain's complex nature and its ability to impact our lives.

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en You can't imagine that everyone has 4 to 7 dreams every night. Each dream lasts about five to 20 minutes. If the life of 80 years The doctor spent nearly 60000 hours dreaming. The equivalent of 10 years of sobriety But what's the use of it This seemingly worthless physiological function like psychosexuality. Since it can be preserved in the long evolution of mankind Is there really anything extraordinary? Hello everyone. Welcome back to Xinghe Baidu Today we're going to talk about the myths about dreams. How does the brain dream? What's the use of dreaming? And whether we can manipulate dreams like Inception. Have you had these dreams too? Dreaming of falling from high altitude. Sometimes the body will shake and wake up from the dream. Dreaming of flying freely. Sometimes afraid. Sometimes it feels good. Dreaming of fighting with people or being hunted. Meng Jie lingers with her male goddess and even strangers. Other dreams include exams, eating, being bitten by snakes, not being able to catch up with buses, etc. It's hard to imagine in an unconscious state The brain can actually make up such a specific and real scene. However, within 10 minutes of waking up. 90% of dreams are cleaned up by the brain again. That's why we dream every day but don't realize it. But now we have to wonder Does the brain do some shady things while we are asleep? Arthur, a graduate student at the University of Chicago While watching babies sleep, Linsky discovered in certain periods of time A baby's eyeballs will move rapidly from side to side accompanied by active brainwave activity But before and after these active sleep stages A baby's eyeball is still Brainwaves also return to calm And what's even weirder These two sleep stages will follow a roughly regular pattern. Repeated over and over again in the night He told his mentor Clayderman about the discovery. This is the slumber. Had locked himself in a gloomy, dark mammoth cave Study circadian rhythms for a full 32 days This time is no exception He repeated it with his daughter, who was still raping her. The experiment got the same result Sleep is not a complete process. Instead, the two sleep stages repeat the cycle. REM sleep and non-REM sleep, respectively Later, another of Clayderman's students, Dimon, was also inspired. did a simple and crude experiment He brought in some subjects and put them to bed first. Then wake them up at different stages of sleep Results When the REM sleep phase is awakened The probability that the subjects were dreaming was almost 90%. So dreams usually occur during REM sleep. What is the brain doing at this time? Nature is not idle As mentioned earlier, brain wave activity during the REM sleep phase is unusually active Scientists discovered through brain scans At this time, areas of the brain associated with vision, movement, emotion and autobiographical memory It's even 30% more active than it was when you were awake. Sounds contradictory, right? The body is sleeping. The brain is awake. And we're not processing outside information when we're asleep. Are these brain cells getting high? In fact Follow when awake The brain transmits sensory information from the outside world to the cortex. REM sleep is to let emotional motivation, memory information in our visual hearing and movement Sensory cortex on the big screen It's like you 've been brought into a fantasy show by your brain, a new element of memory. Just like the previous experience, just like the groom actor. connected in a wonderful and complex way And precisely because there is no script Information Processing Methods of Free Association It just happens to inspire creativity that is hard to get when we're awake. But this also raises a question How does our body know our brain is dreaming? Or did you actually issue an action order? Rest assured The brain only has to make a slight hand a few seconds before entering REM sleep. The brain sends a powerful signal Let our muscles completely lose tension and strength This time the body is locked We can safely dream So as not to bring the exotic plot to reality Just imagine If the body is not locked And you're fighting in your dreams. Will you accidentally kick your lover under the bed? How do you explain it to him, right? If you think dreaming is the brain having fun in a boring sleep. Or a bonus to REM sleep. That would be a big mistake. Its role is far beyond our imagination Some dreams have brought even the most revolutionary leap in human history. My friends all know the periodic table of elements. But you may not know The arrangement of all the known elements in this universe The Russian chemist Mendeleev found it in a dream He had been working for years to find the patterns of these elements. Even made a set of cards Each card records an element and its unique chemical properties And then whether it's at home or on the train It's like being possessed, disrupting again and again. Arrange and then disrupt Unfortunately, they all ended in failure. After three days and nights of sleepless efforts Mendeleev fell asleep in depression and exhaustion Then all the elements and a cousin appeared in his dream. These elements are like well-trained teams One by one in the table check seat And every column and every column shows atomic and electronic characteristics. Perfect laws of logic That's it. A rigorous arrangement of chemical elements to find in such a vague and dramatic way And this is not the only time that the scientific community has achieved a dream. Chemist August Kekule found the chemical structure of benzene in a dream Neuroscientist Otroy discovers nerve cells, way of communicating in dreams undeniable Before they had this kind of creative dream has gone through countless research and thinking in reality Not everyone can accomplish epoch-making in their dreams. But there is no need to question That's dreaming, which really enhances everyone's creativity and problem-solving skills. British scientist Matthew Walker did an interesting experiment He scrambled the letters of the word For example, AMDRE is actually the word dream. and then put the subjects to sleep Also wake them up at different stages of sleep None of these subjects seem to have slept well. After waking them up, have them restore the scrambled letters to the correct word. Each word only takes a few seconds Results During REM sleep That is, when dreaming Those who were woken up, the solution was more effective than those who were woken up during the non-REM sleep phase. They even think the words jump out on their own Researchers think The brain operates in a completely different way than when it's not fast, when it can sleep and when it's awake, when it's dreaming. The brain is no longer limited to the traditional local logic of thinking. It's like looking at the telescope in reverse. Our eyes are no longer focused on the narrow field of vision It's a bird's eye view of the brain's global information. Insight into all possible combinations These are the best sources of creativity So, if you're troubled by something I can't think of it Why don't you go to sleep Maybe the answer is in a dream In addition to creativity. Dreams are also directly related to our emotional and mental health. During the REM sleep phase There's an important stress-related chemical in the brain Complete cessation of norepinephrine release And 24 hours a day This molecule that stimulates anxiety Only when we dream will we stop releasing In other words, the level of negative emotions such as anxiety and sadness is minimized. He's like putting a soothing ointment on a psychological wound. achieve the effect of self-healing In addition Professor Cartlett, Rush University of Chicago After a one-year follow-up study of clinical patients, it was found that People who experience painful experiences with signs of depression If you hide your painful experiences in your dreams It's easier to get rid of despair. return to normal mental state But to repeat the fear deep inside and the bad memory It actually allows us to practice dealing with the most dangerous events and situations. In other words Nightmares are also the brain's way of protecting us. It is often said that time heals all wounds. From a certain point of view, it is sleep and some specific dreams. Let's get out of the pain If you can control your dreams like Inception It means you can do whatever you want in your dreams. Isn't it more enjoyable than playing virtual reality games? But for now It is only in lucid dreams that one has the possibility of manipulating dreams. What is lucid dreaming? Small partners There's no experience that you're dreaming And you know you're dreaming In the dream you also have a clear consciousness It sounds incredible. But a clever experiment did confirm this phenomenon. Scientists took people who could dream lucid dreams and scanned their brains. And let them clench their left hand first, then their right hand So repeatedly The aim was to identify the brain regions that control left and right hand use The subject then goes to sleep In the lucid dream phase They told the researchers with agreed eye movements. I'm going to start holding my left hand and right hand in turn. But because the muscles lose tension when you dream So the subject's hands weren't moving. It's just the brain's instructions for action in a dream. Researchers found after scanning brain activity They signal which hand to hold. The part of the hindbrain that lights up is exactly the same as when you're awake. This means that people who can dream lucid dreams can control what they do in their dreams. Unfortunately, more than 80% of people are not born with the ability to dream lucidly. Although psychophysiologist Stephen LaBegg proposed an inductive method of memory for lucid dreaming But the success rate in the experiment is not high. And for now, scientists don't know whether lucid dreaming is good or bad for humans. So it's like what Outer Westlip said If dream will control really works Mother Nature would allow most people to have this ability. Although it is difficult to control dreams for the time being. But what affects dreams is much simpler. A lot of people think dreams are random But documentary sleep science Dr. Zadera of the University of Montreal mentioned Dreams have many rules to follow. It has a certain continuity with real life. We can also find that some situations are indeed more likely to appear in dreams at certain times. For example, it's easier to dream about exams when you go to school. According to the activated synthesis theory of dreams Dreaming is when different parts of the brain are activated by external signals. And then connect these messages into a dream. In some laboratories, a group of people played a game of skiing. One third of the people have had related dreams. Just imagine If the information obtained is only experienced once during the day Then he'll soon forget Difficult to access long-term memory But if you can reproduce it in your dreams a few times The possibility of remembering is greatly increased. The brain activity that can sleep fast is like a scene reproduction of real experience. Play a role in consolidating memory and strengthening links So essentially it helps us remember and learn Now we not only know how to influence dreams It also seems to discover the role of dreams in our acquisition of new knowledge. such as learning We just need to practice a few more times during the day A good night's sleep will make you remember better. learn faster Of course, we may have overlooked the fact that That is, if you don't sleep well It is impossible to dream well. Anyway, when I can't sleep Will listen to the hypnosis documentary quiet world to fall asleep The white noise inside helps the brain to resonate enter a state of quiet relaxation Finally, I hope everyone can get a good night's sleep. Have a good dream, give a three company The dead of night Wish Although those shy sites for the old driver you have lost the temptation But in order to relieve the exhaustion and stress of the whole day You still can't help but be in the browser's incognito window I have entered a website that I have already memorize. When the red and green flashing picture covered the field of vision Your brain is releasing poison white again Bring you both physical and psychological comfort From the first time the blood spurted to the countless old drivers who read the film. How many times have you forgotten? A few 10G of learning materials were downloaded back again. I also forgot how many times I vowed to abandon those teachers. But always the old love rekindled With the passage of time You're starting to feel uninterested. Lose energy The body is not as good as before, hello everyone Welcome back to Xinghe Baidu Today, let's talk about often watching shy movies. What Subtle Changes in the Brain Or from the first time According to statistics, the average age at which men around the world first browse shy films is ten years old. And that's the age when the first sexual characteristics develop. Before that, boys were basically not interested in the opposite sex. That's why when we were kids watching Journey to the West In the face of so many beauty goblins But I just want the one scratching his head. The monkey was killed with a stick. But that changed completely with the first physical education. How can you stand without personnel? The undescribed images of this scene violently stimulate the brain. What cartoon journey to the west all behind The brain is only busy with one thing. Release of Dopamine Signals transmitted by dopamine activate the reward pathway Gives you a feeling of pleasure and excitement There is pleasure there is desire There is also the possibility of addiction But this mechanism is not an evolutionary failure. On the contrary, it is for the survival of mankind and the continuation of genes. For example, eating and sexual behavior can stimulate the release of dopamine. His logic is to let you taste the benefits first and reward you. You have the motivation to find food Avoid starving to death To find the object, to carry on the family line At this time, the dopamine in the brain is exploding. You don't know why your heart is racing The mind is boiling, the body is hot and dry. But the pleasure you must feel is unprecedented. In this way, the ignorance of adolescence becomes a real desire in the novel picture. Although the first lesson may be over in just a few minutes But the experience has been etched in my mind Once the parent system finds something of potential value It secretes dopamine, which is responsible for learning and memory circuits in the brain. Send a reminder signal to remember what things or actions bring pleasure. How to get this high-intensity stimulation next time It's something you can't get from other actions. Although eating and playing games can also stimulate the brain But none of them are as strong as shy movies. Sex is the behavior that nature can give humans the highest degree of pleasure. So you start to recall and brain repair from time to time. Find a second chance to experience The third desire is formed. So dopamine is also known as the desire molecule. And you'll find yourself becoming particularly sensitive to certain signals. Like seeing sexy pictures. Listen to friends talk about dirty jokes or be alone in a room. They're like triggers Once touched, it activates the brain's desire circuitry. Let you have a strong desire to see the film This is because the brain is sensitized. The brain has a strong plasticity Desire circuit after several stimuli Strengthened connections between nerve cells are more likely to be triggered So information related to yourself Others may be calm and have no waves after watching it. But you might get restless when you see it. With more and more viewing Downloaded learning materials are getting bigger and bigger Slowly you find that the pleasure of watching the movie seems not as strong as before. This is because the reduction in reward prediction error It's not reward that stimulates dopamine, it's reward. Prediction error means that the actual reward has to exceed our expectations. So dopamine also has a name called jade molecule. For example, you have a new bakery downstairs. You'll want to go in and taste how it tastes This feeling comes from the anticipation of something strange is the result of dopamine You think it's delicious, so you come to visit every day. But over time, you'll find that the taste is just as good. The taste of bread has not changed. Change is what you expect Watching the film is the same. I 've seen too much. Those repeated images are basically the same as you expected. Not even as expected Also feel dull In addition, in this process Your brain is also experiencing desensitization. That is, increased tolerance. One study looked at 64 healthy men They watch zero to 19. 5 hours a week. Scan their brains through MRI technology Subjects found to watch more films Decreased activity in the brain's striatum associated with reward and motivation even atrophy In this way The brain becomes dull and numb to stimulation. At this point Your brain has gone from being a little white Turned into a battle-hardened old fritter. You are no longer satisfied with the simple, repetitive Shy films with only a few actors Instead, look for more exciting and alternative. to maintain the initial level of pleasure I guess you're going to think, so hard Don't look at it Of course not so simple Once an addiction is formed, it is difficult to quit. Normally, the dopamine system is not completely static Instead, it will be excited at a rate of 3 to 5 times per second. The rate of watching movies has soared to 20 to 30 times per second. But if the expected reward doesn't materialize The excitation rate of dopamine will drop to zero This sense of drop is very painful I'm used to eating delicacies Suddenly let you eat bran swallow vegetables Then who can stand it, right We see those addicts, alcoholics who can't quit. It's not that they enjoy that extreme pleasure. It's not weak willpower. It's hard to bear the pain of falling to the bottom. Since we can't quit, let's continue to look down. In fact, it is reasonable to say that watching movies is a very common behavior. Almost all men have received this kind of education. The world's biggest shy website gets up to 75 million visits a day Rest assured I will not teach you bad Most users who tell you the address will watch it for more than two hours a week on average. But the problem with addicts is worse. They spend an hour almost every day on car repair. Because there's another change in their brains. frontal lobe function degeneration Dopamine, in the desire circuit, gives us our most primal impulses. But we can also see that this impulse is not untimely regardless of the occasion. Nobody watches a movie in public, right? He is limited by a force to the right range. This power comes from the dopamine control circuit. From Ford Beque through the brain to the frontal lobe He measures the requirements of the loop of desire to understand and analyze Unreasonable demands are suppressed. Reasonable will further plan the program to achieve the goal Normally, people are balanced by the pull of the desire loop and the control loop. But the gray matter in the frontal lobe at the end of the control circuit in addicts changes Decreased ability to control impulses and anticipate consequences I just can't control myself Normal people may still struggle to hurt their bodies when watching movies. It's not the same after the addiction. Desire circuit Hanging control circuit Drinking blood has defeated reason. What else do you think? Hurry up and have a good time. Deeper and deeper in the virtual pleasure And the control force of the control loop drops It's not just affecting the act of watching a movie. You'll find it easier to indulge in instant pleasure More resistant to addictive things Such as smoking, drinking, playing games and so on And those behaviors that require delayed gratification Like learning to socialize and exercise, you are not interested at all. But the problem is that these things are the main theme of real life. If not treated well There must be a backlash. Learning has declined. Relationships are getting worse. I'm not feeling well Various pressures followed To relieve stress, those who like to smoke will smoke a cigarette. Those who like to play games will organize groups to open up black. Of course, those who like watching movies will also go to see one. Stress-processing parts of the addict's brain go wrong This is one of the reasons you can't quit your addiction. Because withdrawal from addiction is inherently stressful. And stress can easily lead addicts to break the ring. It's a dead cycle. In the end, you can't live without shy movies. It is both a reward when happy It is also a consolation when lost. Watching films becomes a subconscious habit Even if he can't give you enough pleasure and satisfaction But you're like eating and sleeping, you can't stop at all. In addition to the effects on the brain You will also find that your body and life are slowly getting worse. According to a 2021 study Male dysfunction referred to as ed There is a clear correlation with the amount of viewing in the film. 21. 48 percent of users have some degree of XED Users who start watching shy movies at a very young age are usually before the age of ten. the proportion of ed is even as high as 58% Plus a lot of movies have the wrong pathological guidance The viewer will inevitably have a tendency to feel inferior psychologically There's another study 1500 young people were surveyed. To understand the effect of the dose used in the Theseus chapter on sexual satisfaction. Results display Watch shy movies more often The lower the satisfaction in reality. And just watching it a few times can make satisfaction start to drop. After all, those beautiful stunts, exaggerated actions and exotic plots in shy movies Many of them cannot be realized in reality. A huge gap between the two experiences It will make you lose interest and desire in your real partner. The reality is not satisfied Can only intensify in the film to find comfort And then in reality more unsatisfied Over time, deeper and deeper Unable to extricate themselves seriously affect the normal life In order to change the status quo You decided to rebuild yourself and quit watching movies. But after only two or three days, withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, irritability and insomnia began to appear. And the more you force yourself not to think about those images The more often your brain teases you According to statistics 82% of men fail because they can't stand the pain of abstaining from sex. But when you make it to two weeks You will find that the desire is not as strong as before. Can focus on study, work and other things without distraction When you see sensitive information, you won't be tempted. This means that dopamine tolerance has slowly declined. A month later, you wake up every morning full of energy The brain no longer pops out of the picture from time to time. Your attention is more focused Thinking is more active. And this is just the beginning of positive feedback Slowly, you will find that you can also get pleasure in studying, traveling and socializing. And this time it's healthy and lasting. No addiction to pleasure. Finally, I would like to say that since the brain has a strong plasticity It can change shape in our hands like clay. Instead of playing around with us like puppets. So come out of the virtual image Try something more realistic. You will see yourself differently. The harvest is not the same happiness Young man Wright was diagnosed with advanced lymphosarcoma cancer. The doctor told him to eat whatever he wanted. Because he didn't think Wright would last a week. But Wright still has a stubborn Doctors were asked to inject him with a new drug that was widely favored at the time. As a result, the tumor decreases rapidly like a snowball in a stove. Wright can even get out of bed for a walk in a week. But two months later, the scientific literature questioned the efficacy of the new drug. Wright was hit hard. The tumor also returns with diarrhea To help Dr. Wright tell a white lie He told Wright that the original batch of drugs had deteriorated due to improper delivery and lost its efficacy. Now this batch of guaranteed efficacy But in fact, this injection is only distilled water Amazingly, Wright got better again. Unfortunately, two months later, the American Medical Association revealed that the drug was worthless. Wright finally loses confidence soon passed away If this doesn't show up in a story in the field of psychology. It is estimated that everyone thinks he is the dog blood plot in which TV series A clinician named LISA Blue Gold was even more disapproving. After all, it challenged his medical knowledge Then he started looking at all the data related to the placebo. It turns out that psychological cues are more powerful than expected. Hello everyone. Welcome back to Xinghe Baidu Today, let's take a look at Dr. Lisa Lienkin's book on the placebo effect. Talk about the magic effect of placebo, the mechanism of action of placebo And how to use psychological hints to make your body and mind strong Wright's case is, after all, an individual. There's a lot of contingency If you find more samples for random, double-blind, etc. There is a control group of experiments, perhaps more research value There's an experiment that fits exactly that. A surgeon named Bruce Morris is trying to prove the effectiveness of his knee surgery. Find two groups of patients with knee pain One group underwent real surgery Another group without knowing it Dr. Morris performed a sham operation In order to make patients believe him The patient was also anesthetized to make an incision and suture the knee. Now, this experiment is somewhat inhumane. Results Patients who underwent real surgery One-third felt pain relief in the knee. Oddly enough, the group that underwent the sham surgery got the same results. You see It's like I'm sick. Whether you have an ancestral recipe or sell dogskin plasters. It doesn't matter whether the pills you gave me are really useful or Meryl. As long as I believe I can be cured by you I can really heal you If psychological forces can really have such a powerful effect on the body The phenomenon of bogus health products that make the elderly obsessed with flour blending also makes sense Perhaps the effect they bring is not just on the psychological level. After all, we underestimate the liar. Since positive psychological cues can make the body and mind more healthy Will negative psychological hints have a negative impact? in a study Two groups of patients participating in a new chemotherapy drug trial The experimental group got the real medicine while the control group was given saline They were allInform may cause adverse reactions to chemotherapy As a result, 30% of the control group also had hair loss symptoms. Another interesting phenomenon is that If medical students insist that they were exposed to the disease they studied It's easier to get this disease. That 79% of people will really get what they want. No wonder Socrates said that if there is no spiritual plan Why to adopt the body That's why doctors never give negative hints to any patient. It's likely that the doctor said who left on the 5th. He can't even make it through the third night More powerful than the King of Hell Sure. The previous cases were all unwitting reactions. If you already know that you are the one to be comforted Will it have a comforting effect? Researchers at Harvard Medical School did this experiment. They had volunteers put their hands on a heating plate that was gradually heating up. Stop heating up when it's too hot to bear Give them a placebo The first group does not know what crisis Probably thought it was scald cream. The second group was told it was a placebo And listen to the researchers explain the placebo effect of knowledge The third group also knew it was a placebo, but did not listen to the explanation. Results The first two groups of volunteers have significantly reduced the pain, the third group did not That is to say, once you understand the principle of the placebo effect Can also play a role in comfort Let's talk about how placebos tap into people's own functions and make their bodies and minds stronger. The easiest mechanism to think of is psychological suggestion. This is the long process of human evolution. The formation of an unconscious self-protection Ability to reduce pain and learn For example, when I am sad to comfort myself will soon be over How much the mood will be comfortable If I tell myself that living is boring It may have been hard to think of it for a long time. the same thing Differences in psychological perception, depending on whether you give yourself a placebo or a nocebo If we look deeper, we can see that this effect is not just in the mind. but to be able to scientifically detect the body did produce a corresponding physiological response For example, thoughts of memory stimulate the release of endorphins. This hormone released by the pituitary gland and hypothalamus The most direct effect is analgesia Can promote virus mitigation elevate emotional state In addition, the placebo effect is associated with the release of dopamine. Dopamine we should all be familiar Affects people's emotions, desires, and feelings to convey excitement and happiness. A case during World War II also explains this phenomenon. U. S. field hospitals run out of painkillers In desperation, the anesthesiologist injected the soldiers with saline. But lie to them and say it's a pain reliever. As a result, the soldiers really felt pain relief. And this is where the placebo effect comes in. In addition, the human body has an emergency mechanism called the stress response. When the brain is threatened It makes people feel fear, anxiety When the pressure is high, this mechanism will be activated. From the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland to the adrenal gland are activated in sequence ultimately raise the body's cortisol and adrenaline levels These hormones set off the alarm in the body. Cause the defense system to work overload The body can't care about other systems. Things like the immune system, cardiovascular system and mental state can be affected So it's easier to get sick when you're stressed. There is a case in the book. A patient with pelvic pain is usually fine. But as soon as his boss shows up, it starts to hurt. because of the tension with the boss It seems that some friends have headaches when they go to work. It's really not a fake And you will find that if you change the environment The mood has become better Some symptoms of discomfort soon disappear This is because there is a relaxation response in the body that opposes the stress response. That is to say, if a person has implanted the belief of hope in his mind A regenerative calm state of mind in the body will be stimulated. to repair the damage done to the body by the stress response If you look at it this way psychological and physiological state of a person It's largely the belief that you'll be better off. A game with the idea that you're going to get worse. 1. use a placebo and develop a positive attitude. This is not a chicken soup without substantial effect. On the contrary A positive attitude can really affect a person's physical and mental health, and even the length of life. Harvard psychologist Laura Kubuzanski targeted 1300 men A 10-year follow-up study Optimists were found to have only half the rate of heart disease as pessimists. Another study showed Subjectively happy people live on average 10 years longer than others Whether healthy people or patients. Optimistic Hope, Sense of Humor Can Reduce Mortality life extension In fact, the change of mentality is very simple Just need to change a thought From the original bad things as a normal life Shift to making good things the norm in life. Because you will find that the more you pay attention to something, the more For example, I used to be the most annoying traffic jam. Blocked three times a week, I feel really unlucky Traffic jams every day, the level of swearing is also rapidly improving. But in fact, I ignored the traffic jam for four days. When I shifted my focus to the other four days It won't smell when you're stuck in traffic. 2. reduces social anxiety with placebo 1961 There is a small town called Roseto in America. There is nothing special about the living habits of the residents of the small town Many people also smoke and drink without exercise. But amazingly, the people here are exceptionally healthy and long-lived. The incidence of heart disease in men under 65 is almost zero A medical doctor discovered after research The relationship between the town, the neighborhood and the neighborhood is very good. Often visit each other, throw a party together This harmonious and close-knit way of socializing Even more than rest and eating habits have a greater impact on health Sure enough, later due to changes in lifestyle Close interpersonal relationships are gone The health benefits don't exist. This is not to say that we have to spend some time maintaining social You like me is a social fear Very little communication with people, in fact, the problem is not big The important thing is to change the perception of this social thing. Because people who are terrorized tend to see others as potential threats. So that every social encounter is a nightmare for them Stress hormones are stimulated Mood and health can be affected But if you don't think of socializing as a burden The body does not react to stress. Instead, you will feel relaxed and can improve your happiness and health. 3. use placebo to resist external pressure. Speaking of stress Young people are the most powerful. 10 years of cold window very not easy to kill a blood road The results found that the market demand is too little, a serious surplus of academic qualifications Self-deprecating contemporary Kong Yiji has also been criticized by the mainstream media for not And employment pressure is only the first hurdle to enter society. There are also marriage and children, child care and old age. Either way, the pressure has to be resolved by itself. Otherwise, it will affect your health and you have to go to the hospital. Another medical pressure. The relaxation response we mentioned earlier. Just enough to bring the body back into dynamic equilibrium under prolonged stress method is also very simple Meditation, for example, works well. If you don't want to shut yourself in a quiet room and practice deep breathing Can also swim, yoga, walking, humming As long as it is consistent with these two elements One is to focus on simple repetition such as breathing, sound, etc The second is not to judge the attitude is to ignore outside information This will trigger a misplaced response. 4. use placebos to boost self-efficacy. There's a girl named Amy Cady. I was in a car accident when I was 19. led to a two standard deviation decline in IQ According to the Wechsler scale, IQ is less than 70 The doctor thinks he's basically saying goodbye to his studies. But it took him eight years to finish his undergraduate and then to get a PhD. become a professor at Harvard University And the secret to his success is to pretend to be successful first. Until it really succeeds During her time in graduate school, Katie always felt like she was overdoing it at school. There was a public speech, and he was nervous about giving up. But the mentor told him that all you had to do was pretend to fool everyone. Until one day you find yourself really like this It gives him a strong sense of self-efficacy Eventually from pretending to be successful to becoming a real success. Our brains have trouble distinguishing between reality and imagination. This is also why people who think of secret admirers will have deer in their hearts. I didn't pretend to be a placebo for success. I could have fooled him. To build a strong heart So next time, feel inferior and nervous. When you don't believe in yourself, tell yourself that I have succeeded. implant this belief into the brain You will find that there is no better catalyst for success than success itself. Finally, although the book mentions that placebos can be used to heal diseases. But personally, I think I still have to listen to the doctor when I'm sick. The larger effect of the placebo effect is to tap into the body's healing power. Helps the body recover faster In addition to this On a psychological level, he does play a powerful suggestive role. Helping us to reduce our inner anxiety Develop a positive mindset Improve self-efficacy These may be the key reasons for maintaining a healthy state of body and mind.
