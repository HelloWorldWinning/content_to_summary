**Summary:**

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   Probabilistic time series forecasting aims to predict future probability distributions based on past time series data.
    *   It's a crucial task in areas like risk management and decision-making.
    *   State Space Models (SSMs) provide a common framework for modeling temporal patterns in time series.
    *   However, real-world time series data are often irregular and noisy, making it hard to define an SSM with traditional statistical methods.
2.  **Proposed Solution: Deep Non-linear State Space Model (DNLSSM)**
    *   DNLSSM is a general framework for probabilistic forecasting.
    *   It combines deep neural networks and statistical methods to model unknown underlying processes.
    *   It iteratively estimates states and network parameters.
    *   The goal is to capture complex temporal patterns.
3.  **Specific Techniques:**
    *   Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is used to calculate marginal likelihoods and update distributions for non-linear functions.
    *   A non-linear Joseph form covariance update ensures the covariance matrices are symmetric and positive definite to enhance UKF's robustness.
    *   This integration of UKF and deep neural networks effectively models non-linear correlations.
4.  **Results and Conclusion:**
    *   Experiments show DNLSSM consistently improves probabilistic forecasting accuracy on synthetic and real-world datasets.

**Core Point:**

The core point is that DNLSSM effectively combines deep learning and statistical methods, specifically the Unscented Kalman Filter and a Joseph form covariance update, to improve probabilistic time series forecasting accuracy in complex, noisy real-world data.

**Fundamental Point:**

The fundamental point is that DNLSSM overcomes the limitations of classical statistical approaches to probabilistic time series forecasting by learning unknown underlying processes using deep neural networks while ensuring stability and accuracy through modified UKF.

**Overarching Framework:**

The overarching framework is a hybrid approach where deep neural networks learn complex temporal patterns and the Unscented Kalman Filter with Joseph form covariance update ensures reliable state estimation and covariance updating for probabilistic time series forecasting.

Content:
Probabilistic time series forecasting aims at estimating future probabilistic distributions based on given time series observations. It is a widespread challenge in various tasks, such as risk management and decision making. To investigate temporal patterns in time series data and predict subsequent probabilities, the state space model (SSM) provides a general framework. Variants of SSM achieve considerable success in many fields, such as engineering and statistics. However, since underlying processes in real-world scenarios are usually unknown and complicated, actual time series observations are always irregular and noisy. Therefore, it is very difficult to determinate an SSM for classical statistical approaches. In this paper, a general time series forecasting framework, called Deep Non-linear State Space Model (DNLSSM), is proposed to predict the probabilistic distribution based on estimated underlying unknown processes from historical time series data. We fuse deep neural networks and statistical methods to iteratively estimate states and network parameters and thus exploit intricate temporal patterns of time series data. In particular, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is adopted to calculate marginal likelihoods and update distributions recursively for non-linear functions. After that, a non-linear Joseph form covariance update is developed to ensure that calculated covariance matrices in UKF updates are symmetric and positive definitive. Therefore, the authors enhance the tolerance of UKF to round-off errors and manage to combine UKF and deep neural networks. In this manner, the DNLSSM effectively models non-linear correlations between observed time series data and underlying dynamic processes. Experiments in both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the DNLSSM consistently improves the accuracy of probability forecasts compared to the baseline methods.
