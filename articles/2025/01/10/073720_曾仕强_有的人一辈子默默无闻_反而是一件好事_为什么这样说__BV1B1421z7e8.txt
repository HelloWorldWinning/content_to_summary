Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Opportunity and Its Challenges**

   *   **Opportunity as a Test:**  When an opportunity arises, it's a significant test of character. Some individuals never encounter such opportunities and live quiet, uneventful lives.
   *   **Duality of Opportunity:**  Seizing an opportunity brings with it a duality – the potential to do good or evil. It reveals how someone will behave under pressure and scrutiny.
   *   **The Risk of Overexposure:**  Opportunities can expose flaws and weaknesses; someone perceived as capable might reveal themselves as incompetent or ridiculous ("一笑大方").
    *   **The "Upward Mobility" Issue:**  People in positions of power will evaluate performance when they're promoted.

**II. The Role of "Li Jian Da Ren" (立见大人) and Perception**

    * **"Li Jian Da Ren":** The "Li Jian Da Ren" can be understood as a superior or someone in a position of power who assesses your performance once you're promoted or given an opportunity.
    *  **Subjective Evaluation:** Ultimately, your success isn't just about performance; it’s also influenced by whether the evaluator favors you.
    *  **Influence of Perception:** Performance is often judged based on the whims of the person overseeing the situation, leading to the saying "朝中无人没做官" (without support from people in power, it's hard to succeed).

**III. Case Study: Zhuge Liang (诸葛亮)**

   * **Initial Success:** Zhuge Liang's entry into Liu Bei's service (after being 三顾茅庐, "three times invited") led to recognition, respect, and authority. Liu Bei initially supported him.
   * **Overdoing It:** However, Zhuge Liang's success and power created tension. He overstepped his bounds by going directly against Liu Bei.
   * **Long-Term Consequences:**  His assertive actions, though beneficial to the common people, ultimately sowed the seeds of his own problems, highlighting that overperforming can lead to issues down the line.

**Core Point:** Seizing opportunities is a double-edged sword, revealing character and requiring careful navigation to avoid both failure and overreaching success.

**Fundamental Point:**  The ability to manage opportunities effectively and navigate power dynamics is crucial for long-term success, and overperformance can be as problematic as underperformance.

**Overarching Framework:** The overarching framework revolves around the themes of opportunity, assessment, power dynamics, and the importance of balance in success, as well as avoiding the pitfalls of over-demonstrating one's capability.
