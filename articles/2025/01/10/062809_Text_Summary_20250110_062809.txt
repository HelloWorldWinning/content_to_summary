        *   Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)
        *   Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)
        *   Transformers
        *   Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
        *   Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL)
    *   The paper reviews their mathematical foundations, learning processes, and applications in finance.

3.  **Applications in Financial Contexts:**
    *   These models are applied to tasks including:
        *   Algorithmic trading
        *   Risk management
        *   Portfolio optimization
    *   The study discusses the advantages and limitations of each model for these specific tasks.

4.  **Emerging Trends and Challenges:**
    *   Recent advances and emerging trends are examined within the financial industry.
    *   Critical challenges are also identified such as:
        *   Data quality
