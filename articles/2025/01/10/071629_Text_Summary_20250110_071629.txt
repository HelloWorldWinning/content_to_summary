Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Introduction & Problem:**

*   **A. Context:**  The rise of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) necessitates accurate power output forecasting.
*   **B. Challenge:** Traditional methods that require individual models for each DSG are not feasible due to numerous DSGs and limited historical data.
*   **C. Goal:** To develop a generalized model for forecasting power output of unseen DSGs by adapting an attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model.

**II. Proposed Solution & Methodology:**

*   **A. Model:** A solar TFT (STFT) model is proposed and tested using 188 real-world operational DSG data.
*   **B. Validation:** The modelâ€™s generalizability is validated by its ability to accurately forecast power output of unseen DSGs without training data.
*   **C. Experiment:** The performance of STFT is compared against a persistence model and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model in 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons.
*   **D. Evaluation:** Analysis of forecast performance under clear, partly cloudy, and overcast weather conditions.

**III. Results & Discussion:**

*   **A. Performance:** STFT outperforms the persistence model by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% and the LSTM model by 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively.
*   **B. Advantage:** STFT demonstrates better accuracy in high variability periods, especially during weather transitions.
*   **C. Trade-off:** STFT has a higher computational cost due to its model complexity compared to other deep learning models.

**IV. Conclusion:**

*   **Core Point:** The adapted solar TFT model demonstrates improved power output forecasting accuracy for unseen distributed solar generation units, outperforming both persistence and LSTM models.
*  **Fundamental Point:** The self-attention mechanism, when applied to time-series forecasting for distributed solar generation, presents a promising approach to model generalizability, despite increased computational complexity.

**V. Overarching Framework:**
This research presents a methodological framework where an advanced time-series forecasting model based on attention mechanisms is employed to tackle the challenge of forecasting power output for a large number of urban distributed solar generation sites, particularly for those without historical data. The approach centers around the adaptation and validation of a sophisticated model that balances forecasting accuracy against computational costs.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
