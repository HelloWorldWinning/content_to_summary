Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Challenge:**
    *   The growth of small-scale urban Distributed Solar Generation (DSG) requires accurate forecasting models for individual sites.
    *   Traditional methods creating individual models for each DSG are not cost-effective due to numerous DSGs across cities and a lack of historical data.

2.  **Solution:**
    *   This research adapts the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), a state-of-the-art attention-based model, for DSG forecasting (Solar TFT - STFT).
    *   The STFT is tested on 188 real-world operational DSG datasets to validate the generalizability of its self-attention mechanism.

3.  **Results:**
    *   STFT improves significantly over persistence models: 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons.
    *   STFT outperforms LSTM (a deep-learning time-series model) with improvements of 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively.
    *   STFT excels during high variability periods, particularly during weather transitions, where other models struggle with lagged predictions.
    *   However, STFT has a higher computational cost than other models due to its more complex architecture.

4.  **Trade-off:**
    *   There is a trade-off between improved accuracy (STFT) and computational efficiency (other models).
    *   Practical applications must consider this trade-off.

**Core Point:** The adaptation of the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) for solar distributed generation forecasting, named STFT, offers superior accuracy, particularly during variable weather conditions, but it comes at the cost of increased computational demands.

**Fundamental Point:**  Self-attention mechanisms, as employed in the STFT, demonstrate robust generalizability in multi-step time series forecasting for distributed solar generation, even in scenarios with limited historical data, despite the increased computational complexity.

**Overarching Framework:**
The research is centered on developing an accurate and generalizable forecasting model for Distributed Solar Generation (DSG), tackling the challenge of limited historical data and the need for site-adaptability. It introduces an advanced model (STFT) based on attention mechanisms, and evaluates its performance against simpler models, highlighting a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
