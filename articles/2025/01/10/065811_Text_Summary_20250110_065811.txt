Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   The rise of small-scale distributed solar generation (DSG) requires accurate site-adaptive forecasting models.
    *   Traditional methods that build individual models for each DSG are impractical due to the lack of historical data and the large number of DSGs in urban areas.

2.  **Solution:**
    *   Adapt a state-of-the-art attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model for DSG power output forecasting.
    *   The proposed model is named Solar TFT (STFT).
    *   Validate the generalizability of self-attention mechanism using 188 real-world operational DSG datasets.

3.  **Results:**
    *   STFT significantly improves forecast accuracy compared to the persistence model at 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons (11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% improvement, respectively).
    *   STFT outperforms representative deep learning models (e.g., LSTM) by 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% at the same horizons.
    *   STFT excels during high variability periods, especially weather transitions.

4.  **Trade-off:**
    *   STFT has a more complex architecture and higher computational cost than simpler models.
    *   A balance between accuracy and computational efficiency must be considered for practical applications.

5.  **Core Point:** The Solar TFT model leverages the self-attention mechanism to achieve improved forecast accuracy in predicting distributed solar generation output, especially for unseen sites and during high variability periods.

6.  **Fundamental Point:** Adapting advanced deep learning models like TFTs to address the challenges of forecasting in decentralized energy systems offers a promising route toward better resource management and integration, even in cases with limited data availability.

7.  **Overarching Framework:** The research focuses on the following steps: identification of the challenge of forecasting with distributed solar generation, proposition of the novel approach based on TFT model adaptation, demonstration of its efficacy through real-world data, and highlighting the trade-offs for practical implementation.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
