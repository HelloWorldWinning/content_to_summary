Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Core Ideas:**

*   **Problem:**  Traditional methods of creating individual forecasting models for each distributed solar generation (DSG) unit are not practical for large-scale urban deployments due to the high number of DSGs and limited historical data.
*   **Proposed Solution:**  Adapt the attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model for multi-step time series forecasting of DSG output. This adapted model is named Solar TFT (STFT).
*   **Methodology:** The STFT model is tested on 188 real-world operational DSG datasets, assessing its generalizability to unseen DSGs without prior training data.
*   **Results:** STFT shows significant improvements in forecast accuracy over both the persistence model and a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, particularly in the short-term (10-30 minutes ahead). The advantages are most pronounced during weather transition periods.
*   **Trade-Off:** STFT has higher computational costs and model complexity compared to other deep learning models.

**II. Core Point:**

The Solar TFT model demonstrates superior accuracy in forecasting distributed solar generation output, especially in variable weather conditions and for unseen locations, suggesting the effectiveness of the self-attention mechanism in multi-step time series prediction within urban solar contexts.

**III. Fundamental Point:**

By leveraging the generalizable properties of an attention-based model, the study addresses the challenge of forecasting power output in large-scale, urban distributed solar generation where individual model training for each unit is infeasible, marking a practical step forward in renewable energy management.

**IV. Overarching Framework:**

The overarching framework involves using an advanced forecasting model (TFT) for large scale urban solar deployment where there are limited data available and traditional approaches are not economically feasible and also demonstrating the model's effectiveness on unseen DSGs while still ensuring an efficient computation and trade-offs.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
