Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Introduction**
    *   The video presents a trading strategy with a high win rate.
    *   The strategy uses a combination of three indicators: Stochastic RSI, RSI, and MACD.
    *   The video includes backtesting to demonstrate the strategy's effectiveness.

**II. Indicators and Their Usage**
    *   **Stochastic:**
        *   Used for identifying overbought and oversold levels (main entry signal).
        *   Consists of K% (blue line) and D% (orange line).
        *   Avoid trading it in isolation to prevent a low win rate.
    *   **RSI:**
        *   Modified to function as a trend confirmation indicator, not for overbought/oversold signals.
        *   A single line at the 50 level; above 50 indicates an uptrend, below 50 indicates a downtrend.
    *   **MACD:**
        *   Used to confirm momentum; not for entry signals.
        *   Confirmation is based on the MACD line crossing above (uptrend) or below (downtrend) the signal line.

**III. Entry Strategy**
    *   **Buy Signal:**
        1.  Stochastic: K% and D% lines in oversold territory.
        2.  RSI: Above the middle line (50) confirming uptrend.
        3.  MACD: Line crosses above the signal line, confirming upward momentum.
        4.  Stochastic lines haven't reached overbought yet.
    *   **Sell Signal:**
        1.  Stochastic: K% and D% lines in overbought territory.
        2.  RSI: Below the middle line (50) confirming downtrend.
        3.  MACD: Line crosses below the signal line, confirming downward momentum.
         4. Stochastic lines haven't reached oversold yet.

**IV. Exit Strategy**
    *   **Buy Positions:**
        *   Stop loss below the nearest swing low.
        *   Profit target at 1.5 times the stop-loss distance.
    *   **Sell Positions:**
        *   Stop loss above the nearest swing high.
        *   Profit target at 1.5 times the stop-loss distance.

**V. Backtesting**
    *   100 trades on EUR/USD with 30-minute timeframe.
    *   Initial capital of $1000 with 2% risk per trade.
    *   Leverage of 200x.
    *   Results:
        *   56% win rate.
        *   Max 5 wins in a row.
        *   Max 3 losses in a row.
        *   Total profit of $280.41.

**VI. Optimization Tips**
    *   Limit stop loss to 0.15% of the capital to control risk
    *   Avoid opening a new trade before closing the previous one.

**Core Point:** A high-win-rate trading strategy is achieved by combining Stochastic RSI, RSI for trend confirmation, and MACD for momentum confirmation with specific entry and exit criteria and back tested with a 56% win rate.

**Fundamental Point:** Combining multiple indicators and using them for specific, non-redundant purposes can improve the accuracy of trading signals and reduce false positives.

**Overarching Framework:** The content provides a structured approach to a trading strategy, detailing each component from indicator selection to entry/exit rules, back testing and optimization.

rate rate rate by back testing the strategy 100 times by back testing the strategy 100 times by back testing the strategy 100 times so without further ado so without further ado so without further ado let's get on with the video for this let's get on with the video for this let's get on with the video for this strategy strategy strategy we are using a combination of three we are using a combination of three we are using a combination of three indicators indicators indicators the stochastic rsi the stochastic rsi the stochastic rsi and macd first let's start with the and macd first let's start with the and macd first let's start with the stochastic stochastic stochastic because that will generate our main because that will generate our main because that will generate our main entry signal entry signal entry signal the stochastic is a very simple to use the stochastic is a very simple to use the stochastic is a very simple to use indicator indicator indicator that does a very good job of identifying that does a very good job of identifying that does a very good job of identifying overbought overbought overbought and oversold levels on the market and oversold levels on the market and oversold levels on the market it consists of two parts the blue line it consists of two parts the blue line it consists of two parts the blue line which is called the k which is called the k which is called the k percentage and the orange line which is percentage and the orange line which is percentage and the orange line which is called the d percentage called the d percentage called the d percentage one of the most common mistakes that one of the most common mistakes that one of the most common mistakes that traders make when using this indicator traders make when using this indicator traders make when using this indicator is that they're trading the stochastic is that they're trading the stochastic is that they're trading the stochastic by itself by itself by itself so they take a buy position every time so they take a buy position every time so they take a buy position every time the indicator hits oversold the indicator hits oversold the indicator hits oversold and they take a sell position every time and they take a sell position every time and they take a sell position every time the indicator hits overbought the indicator hits overbought the indicator hits overbought if you're still using the indicator this if you're still using the indicator this if you're still using the indicator this way you will get a very low win rate way you will get a very low win rate way you will get a very low win rate instead you need to combine the instead you need to combine the instead you need to combine the stochastic with stochastic with stochastic with other indicators to further confirm your other indicators to further confirm your other indicators to further confirm your analysis analysis analysis and so let's move on to the second and so let's move on to the second and so let's move on to the second indicator for our strategy indicator for our strategy indicator for our strategy which is the rsi the rsi which is the rsi the rsi which is the rsi the rsi is one of the most famous indicators is one of the most famous indicators is one of the most famous indicators used in trading used in trading used in trading and a popular way of using the rsi is by and a popular way of using the rsi is by and a popular way of using the rsi is by trading it as an overbought trading it as an overbought trading it as an overbought and oversold indicator however and oversold indicator however and oversold indicator however for this combination strategy we already for this combination strategy we already for this combination strategy we already have the stochastic to do that job have the stochastic to do that job have the stochastic to do that job so having two indicators that give the so having two indicators that give the so having two indicators that give the same signals is quite useless same signals is quite useless same signals is quite useless instead we are using the rsi as a trend instead we are using the rsi as a trend instead we are using the rsi as a trend confirmation indicator and confirmation indicator and confirmation indicator and to do that first we need to go to the to do that first we need to go to the to do that first we need to go to the indicator settings indicator settings indicator settings and change both of these levels to 50. and change both of these levels to 50. and change both of these levels to 50. so now we have a single line in the so now we have a single line in the so now we have a single line in the middle like this middle like this middle like this and the way we use it to confirm a trend and the way we use it to confirm a trend and the way we use it to confirm a trend is very simple is very simple is very simple if the rsi is above the middle line it if the rsi is above the middle line it if the rsi is above the middle line it means that the price is on an uptrend means that the price is on an uptrend means that the price is on an uptrend so you only take buy positions and if so you only take buy positions and if so you only take buy positions and if the rsi is below the middle line the rsi is below the middle line the rsi is below the middle line it means that the price is on a it means that the price is on a it means that the price is on a downtrend so you only take downtrend so you only take downtrend so you only take cell positions now let's move on to the cell positions now let's move on to the cell positions now let's move on to the third indicator third indicator third indicator which is the macd the macd is one of the which is the macd the macd is one of the which is the macd the macd is one of the most popular indicators that does a very most popular indicators that does a very most popular indicators that does a very good job of detecting momentum good job of detecting momentum good job of detecting momentum and a common way of using the macd is by and a common way of using the macd is by and a common way of using the macd is by taking a buy position if the macd line taking a buy position if the macd line taking a buy position if the macd line crosses above the signal line crosses above the signal line crosses above the signal line and taking a cell position if the macd and taking a cell position if the macd and taking a cell position if the macd line crosses below the signal line line crosses below the signal line line crosses below the signal line however this strategy only works if the however this strategy only works if the however this strategy only works if the market is trending market is trending market is trending if the market is moving sideways the if the market is moving sideways the if the market is moving sideways the macd macd macd often gives false signals so that is why often gives false signals so that is why often gives false signals so that is why for this combination strategy for this combination strategy for this combination strategy we are not going to buy or sell just we are not going to buy or sell just we are not going to buy or sell just because the macd crosses over because the macd crosses over because the macd crosses over instead we are using it to give extra instead we are using it to give extra instead we are using it to give extra confirmation confirmation confirmation and making sure that the momentum is on and making sure that the momentum is on and making sure that the momentum is on our side our side our side and so this is how the stochastic rsi and so this is how the stochastic rsi and so this is how the stochastic rsi and macd strategy works first and macd strategy works first and macd strategy works first let's start with their entry signal to let's start with their entry signal to let's start with their entry signal to identify identify identify a buy signal the first step is you want a buy signal the first step is you want a buy signal the first step is you want to look at the stochastic to look at the stochastic to look at the stochastic and wait for both the k and d lines to and wait for both the k and d lines to and wait for both the k and d lines to hit oversold hit oversold hit oversold then you want to use the rsi to confirm then you want to use the rsi to confirm then you want to use the rsi to confirm the uptrend the uptrend the uptrend by making sure that it's above the by making sure that it's above the by making sure that it's above the middle line middle line middle line the next step is you want to use the the next step is you want to use the the next step is you want to use the macd to confirm the upwards momentum macd to confirm the upwards momentum macd to confirm the upwards momentum by waiting for the macd line to cross by waiting for the macd line to cross by waiting for the macd line to cross above the signal line above the signal line above the signal line once this happens however you still need once this happens however you still need once this happens however you still need to make sure that both of the stochastic to make sure that both of the stochastic to make sure that both of the stochastic lines still hasn't hit overbought yet lines still hasn't hit overbought yet lines still hasn't hit overbought yet and if all the rules were met you take a and if all the rules were met you take a and if all the rules were met you take a buy position buy position buy position let's move on to finding cell signals let's move on to finding cell signals let's move on to finding cell signals again again again the first step is you want to look at the first step is you want to look at the first step is you want to look at the stochastic the stochastic the stochastic and wait for both the k and d lines to and wait for both the k and d lines to and wait for both the k and d lines to hit overbought hit overbought hit overbought then you want to use the rsi to confirm then you want to use the rsi to confirm then you want to use the rsi to confirm the downtrend the downtrend the downtrend by making sure that it's below the by making sure that it's below the by making sure that it's below the middle line middle line middle line the next step is you want to use the the next step is you want to use the the next step is you want to use the macd to confirm the downwards momentum macd to confirm the downwards momentum macd to confirm the downwards momentum by waiting for the macd line to cross by waiting for the macd line to cross by waiting for the macd line to cross below the signal line below the signal line below the signal line and you still need to make sure that and you still need to make sure that and you still need to make sure that both of the knd line still has it hit both of the knd line still has it hit both of the knd line still has it hit oversold oversold oversold once all the rules are met you take a once all the rules are met you take a once all the rules are met you take a sell position sell position sell position [Music] [Music] [Music] now for your exit strategy if you took now for your exit strategy if you took now for your exit strategy if you took buy positions buy positions buy positions you want to place your stop loss below you want to place your stop loss below you want to place your stop loss below the nearest swing low the nearest swing low the nearest swing low and set your profit target at 1. 5 times and set your profit target at 1. 5 times and set your profit target at 1. 5 times your stop your stop your stop loss similarly if you took cell loss similarly if you took cell loss similarly if you took cell positions positions positions you want to place your stop loss above you want to place your stop loss above you want to place your stop loss above the nearest swing high the nearest swing high the nearest swing high and set your profit target at 1. 5 times and set your profit target at 1. 5 times and set your profit target at 1. 5 times your stop loss your stop loss your stop loss so now before we back test this strategy so now before we back test this strategy so now before we back test this strategy 100 times 100 times 100 times let's look at it in full action in this let's look at it in full action in this let's look at it in full action in this chart chart chart we can see that both of the k and d we can see that both of the k and d we can see that both of the k and d lines is that oversold lines is that oversold lines is that oversold meaning we're going to take a buy meaning we're going to take a buy meaning we're going to take a buy position then position then position then you want to confirm the uptrend by you want to confirm the uptrend by you want to confirm the uptrend by making sure that the rsi making sure that the rsi making sure that the rsi is above the middle line the next step is above the middle line the next step is above the middle line the next step is you want to use the macd to further is you want to use the macd to further is you want to use the macd to further confirm the upwards momentum confirm the upwards momentum confirm the upwards momentum by waiting for the macd line to cross by waiting for the macd line to cross by waiting for the macd line to cross above the signal line above the signal line above the signal line and you still need to make sure that and you still need to make sure that and you still need to make sure that both of the stochastic lines still both of the stochastic lines still both of the stochastic lines still hasn't hit hasn't hit hasn't hit overbought yet once all the rules are overbought yet once all the rules are overbought yet once all the rules are met met met you take a buy position now for your you take a buy position now for your you take a buy position now for your stop loss stop loss stop loss you place it below the nearest swing low you place it below the nearest swing low you place it below the nearest swing low and set your profit target at 1. 5 times and set your profit target at 1. 5 times and set your profit target at 1. 5 times your stop loss your stop loss your stop loss let's look at another example in this let's look at another example in this let's look at another example in this chart chart chart we can see that both of the k and d we can see that both of the k and d we can see that both of the k and d lines is at overbought lines is at overbought lines is at overbought meaning we're going to take a cell meaning we're going to take a cell meaning we're going to take a cell position then position then position then you want to confirm the downtrend by you want to confirm the downtrend by you want to confirm the downtrend by making sure that the rsi making sure that the rsi making sure that the rsi is below the middle line the next step is below the middle line the next step is below the middle line the next step is you want to use the macd to further is you want to use the macd to further is you want to use the macd to further confirm the downwards momentum confirm the downwards momentum confirm the downwards momentum by waiting for the macd line to cross by waiting for the macd line to cross by waiting for the macd line to cross below the signal line below the signal line below the signal line and make sure that both of the k and d and make sure that both of the k and d and make sure that both of the k and d lines still hasn't hit oversold lines still hasn't hit oversold lines still hasn't hit oversold once this happens you take a cell once this happens you take a cell once this happens you take a cell position position position and for your stop loss you place it and for your stop loss you place it and for your stop loss you place it above the nearest swing high above the nearest swing high above the nearest swing high and set your profit target at 1. 5 times and set your profit target at 1. 5 times and set your profit target at 1. 5 times your stop loss your stop loss your stop loss so now i'm going to prove that this so now i'm going to prove that this so now i'm going to prove that this strategy actually works strategy actually works strategy actually works by back testing it 100 times for this by back testing it 100 times for this by back testing it 100 times for this back test back test back test i'm going to use the euro usd 30 minute i'm going to use the euro usd 30 minute i'm going to use the euro usd 30 minute time frame time frame time frame with a starting capital of 1000 and with a starting capital of 1000 and with a starting capital of 1000 and for our money management we are risking for our money management we are risking for our money management we are risking two percent of our total capital per two percent of our total capital per two percent of our total capital per trade trade trade and for each trade we are using 200 and for each trade we are using 200 and for each trade we are using 200 times leverage times leverage times leverage by the way you can download this back by the way you can download this back by the way you can download this back testing tool for free testing tool for free testing tool for free in the description below so without in the description below so without in the description below so without further ado let's start back testing [Music] and finally after back testing the and finally after back testing the and finally after back testing the strategy 100 times strategy 100 times strategy 100 times the results are in it took us 134 days the results are in it took us 134 days the results are in it took us 134 days to reach 100 trades to reach 100 trades to reach 100 trades and out of that 100 trades we received a and out of that 100 trades we received a and out of that 100 trades we received a very good win rate very good win rate very good win rate of 56 our most wins in a row was five of 56 our most wins in a row was five of 56 our most wins in a row was five and our most losses in a row was three and our most losses in a row was three and our most losses in a row was three and in total we made a profit of 280 and in total we made a profit of 280 and in total we made a profit of 280 dollars dollars dollars and 41 cents which equates to around 28 and 41 cents which equates to around 28 and 41 cents which equates to around 28 overall gain of our 1 000 capital so after back testing i discovered a so after back testing i discovered a so after back testing i discovered a couple of optimization and changes that couple of optimization and changes that couple of optimization and changes that you can implement you can implement you can implement to further increase the win rate for the to further increase the win rate for the to further increase the win rate for the strategy strategy strategy the first one is limiting your stop loss the first one is limiting your stop loss the first one is limiting your stop loss so normally if you're taking a sale so normally if you're taking a sale so normally if you're taking a sale position position position you want to set your stop loss at the you want to set your stop loss at the you want to set your stop loss at the nearest swing high nearest swing high nearest swing high however in this particular trade you can however in this particular trade you can however in this particular trade you can see that the swing high is too far away see that the swing high is too far away see that the swing high is too far away from the price from the price from the price therefore your risk will be too large therefore your risk will be too large therefore your risk will be too large and and and it can potentially give you a massive it can potentially give you a massive it can potentially give you a massive loss and that is why i recommend loss and that is why i recommend loss and that is why i recommend limiting your stop loss to only 0. 15 limiting your stop loss to only 0. 15 limiting your stop loss to only 0. 15 so no matter how far your stop loss is so no matter how far your stop loss is so no matter how far your stop loss is your loss will never exceed 0. 15 percent your loss will never exceed 0. 15 percent your loss will never exceed 0. 15 percent another tip that you can use is don't another tip that you can use is don't another tip that you can use is don't open a new position open a new position open a new position if you haven't closed your previous one if you haven't closed your previous one if you haven't closed your previous one let me explain let me explain let me explain if you're taking a position you only if you're taking a position you only if you're taking a position you only exit a trade if the price either hits exit a trade if the price either hits exit a trade if the price either hits your stop loss your stop loss your stop loss or profit target however or profit target however or profit target however there are times where the trade takes a there are times where the trade takes a there are times where the trade takes a long time to hit a target long time to hit a target long time to hit a target and as a result you will miss a couple and as a result you will miss a couple and as a result you will miss a couple of entry signals along the way of entry signals along the way of entry signals along the way which is perfectly fine i recommend which is perfectly fine i recommend which is perfectly fine i recommend sticking to only one trade at a time sticking to only one trade at a time sticking to only one trade at a time because managing more than one trades is because managing more than one trades is because managing more than one trades is very hard so i just revealed to you a very simple so i just revealed to you a very simple so i just revealed to you a very simple high win rate strategy high win rate strategy high win rate strategy that you can immediately use right now that you can immediately use right now that you can immediately use right now and and and all i ask for in return is for you to all i ask for in return is for you to all i ask for in return is for you to invest 2 seconds of your time into invest 2 seconds of your time into invest 2 seconds of your time into liking the video liking the video
