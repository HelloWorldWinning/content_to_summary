Description:
**Summary:**

**1. Core Ideas:**

*   **Problem:** The need for accurate solar power forecasting for numerous, small-scale, urban distributed solar generation (DSG) sites lacking historical data, where creating individual models for each DSG is not feasible.
*   **Proposed Solution:** Adapting the attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model, referred to as Solar TFT (STFT), to generalize for multiple DSGs, including those with no prior training data.
*   **Validation:** The STFT model was tested using 188 real-world operational DSG datasets and compared against the persistence model and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.
*   **Results:**
    *   STFT demonstrates significant improvement over the persistence model across 10, 20, and 30-minute forecasts (11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76%, respectively).
    *   STFT also showed better forecast accuracy than the LSTM model at the same forecast horizons (3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% improvement).
    *   STFT is particularly effective during weather transition periods and high variability conditions.
    *   However, the STFT has higher computational costs compared to other models.

**2. Core Point:**

The study demonstrates that an adapted Temporal Fusion Transformer (STFT) model can accurately forecast solar power output for multiple distributed solar generation sites, even with limited or no historical data, outperforming both persistence and LSTM models.

**3. Fundamental Point:**

The self-attention mechanism within the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) proves effective for generalizing time series forecasting in the context of diverse, small-scale solar generation sites across urban environments.

**4. Overarching Framework:**

This work focuses on applying a state-of-the-art model for time series forecasting, specifically an adapted Temporal Fusion Transformer, to address a practical problem in the energy domain â€“ forecasting solar power output for a large number of small urban distributed solar generators where traditional per-site model creation is not feasible due to data scarcity. It further evaluates the model's performance under real-world conditions, identifying its effectiveness, limitations, and practical implications.

Content:
The emergence of small-scale urban distributed solar generation (DSG) has urged the exploration of site- adaptive forecasting models designed to accurately predict future power outputs for unseen DSGs. In such scenarios, with numerous DSGs spread across utility-scale cities and a lack of historical data, it is not economically viable to use conventional approaches that develop individual models for each DSG. Therefore, this work aims to tackle this real-world challenge by adapting the state-of-the-art, attention-based temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to 188 real-world operational DSG data, thereby validating the generalizability of self-attention mechanism for multi-step time series forecasting. When adapted to unseen DSGs without training data, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solar TFT (STFT) improves by 11.07%, 17.58%, and 22.76% over the persistence model at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecasts, respectively. Even when compared to representative deep-learning models, such as a long short-term memory model specialized in time series forecasting, STFT has demonstrated improved forecast accuracy, achieving 3.34%, 4.18%, and 5.85% enhancements at the 10-, 20-, and 30-minute forecast horizons, respectively. However, the model architecture of STFT is more complex, and the computational cost associated with it is relatively higher compared to other deep learning models. This trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. The forecast performance is analyzed in three typical weather conditions, namely, clear, partly cloudy, and overcast. STFT demonstrates advantages in high variability periods, especially during weather transition periods, where reference models experience lagged predictions yielding relatively large errors.
