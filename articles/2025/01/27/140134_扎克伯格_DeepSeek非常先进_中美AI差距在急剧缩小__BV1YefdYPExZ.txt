 There's this great Chinese model that just came out, this company DeepSeek. They're doing really good work. It's a very advanced model. I just think we should all want the American companies to win at this. This is a huge geopolitical competition, and like China's running out at super hard, and we should want the American companies and the American standard to win. If there's going to be an open source model that everyone uses, we should want an American model. But at every step along the way, if the government is making that harder rather than easier, then that's... I don't know. There's an extent to which the American tech industry is leading, so maybe the government can get in the way a little bit, and maybe the American industry will still lead. But I don't know. I think it's getting really competitive. I think it's easy for the government to take for granted that the US will lead on all these things. I think it's a very close competition, and we need the help. We need them to be a force that's helping us to do these things.
