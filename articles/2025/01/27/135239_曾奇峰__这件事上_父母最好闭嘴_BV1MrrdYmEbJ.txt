Description:
**Summary:**

*   **I. Parental Influence and Projection:**
    *   Parents often project their own desires and preferences onto their children when guiding them.
    *   This projection can lead parents to encourage specific activities (A) while disregarding a child's genuine interest in something else (B).
    *   Repeatedly pushing their preference (A) can make the child feel pressured to like it, even if they don't.

*   **II. Confusion and Loss of Intrinsic Motivation:**
    *   This pressure and constant redirection causes confusion in children, leading them to doubt their own preferences.
    *   Children may end up performing behaviors or preferences that they don't authentically enjoy in order to please their parents.
    *   This situation can kill children's motivation and passion, make them feel lost.

*   **III. Parental Self-Reflection:**
    *   Parents need to be self-aware and understand their own motivations when interacting with their children.
    *   Parents should critically examine whether they are imposing their own desires under the guise of respecting their child's needs.
    *   Parents must have the courage to genuinely respect the child's own wishes and choices.

*   **IV. Connection with Short-lived Enthusiasm (几分钟热度):**
    *   The forced imposition of parental preferences can connect with the phenomenon of "short-lived enthusiasm."
    *  If a child is forced to do what parents like, the child will find his motivation quickly diminished, and find a reason to give up.

**Core Point:** Parental projection of desires undermines a child's intrinsic motivation and creates confusion about their own preferences.

**Fundamental Point:** Parents must engage in self-reflection to ensure they are genuinely respecting their child's autonomy rather than imposing their own unfulfilled desires.

**Overarching Framework:** The content explores the negative impacts of parental projection on children's development, emphasizing the importance of parental self-awareness and genuine respect for the child's individual preferences.

我真的像说一个交往过真的就是说法就是家长最好是闭嘴因为我看到无数的家长在引导或者是鼓励孩子做某一件事情的时候相当大的程度是在投射就是他们把自己的喜欢强加个孩子或者是要剥夺孩子本人的动力就是他们内心里面实际上是有选择的他喜欢孩子做A但是他看到孩子对B明显的感兴趣的时候他就会反复说你喜B喜欢A最后都说到孩子不喜欢A都不好意思了因为这背胖现在才没可能用一种把胖胖跑起后抹沙了最后孩子也糊涂了我真的碰到这种很多这样的情况孩子也糊涂了他不知道自己到这喜欢A还是喜欢B他在表演自己爱附怒的时候他需要让自己喜欢A但是有时候他又觉得B更好玩所以最终他选择的有可能是被父母安时的那个东西跟刚才我们说的几分钟热度这个事情结合起来的话我们就能够理解为什么孩子他喜欢跟一套为什么目料了因为他本来就不喜欢是被父母安时的所以在这个事情上面我觉得父母心真的是要充分地了解自己就是在跟孩子打架的时候你是不是以尊重他的冤枉的名义在加带自己的私货你有没有勇气直接尊重孩子的冤枉
