Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Key Ideas:**

*   **Rejecting Pursuit of Fleeting Happiness:** The core idea is to avoid chasing after transient "happiness" (快乐), because it inevitably leads to sadness (悲).
*   **Emphasis on Inner Peace and Ease:** Instead of seeking external happiness, focus on cultivating inner contentment (类心愉快) and ease (轻松).
*   **Importance of Self-Regulation:**  One should take care of themselves and "tune" themselves to achieve a state of ease and mental clarity.
*   **Avoiding Haste and Anxiety:** The speaker warns against the modern tendency of being too rushed (太急著), as it can be self-destructive and prevent one from truly living.
*   **Balanced Approach:** Emphasizes the need for quick actions with a calm mind. A calm mind is essential to achieve quick actions. Actions should be light and swift, while the mind should be settled, and the thinking clear. Movement quickness depends on mental stability.

True well-being comes from cultivating inner peace and ease, rather than chasing fleeting happiness, which is transient and will inevitably lead to sadness.

Self-regulation, inner stability, and a balanced approach are crucial for achieving ease and contentment in life.

我最后的建议,人要活的轻松自宅而不是快乐,不是快乐。因为有乐,他一定生悲,那一定生悲。我们讲究的是类心愉快而不是身体快乐,不是。好好的把自己调理调理。快乐自宅,这句话变成什么?愉乐自宅,轻松自宅。我不缓,不许,也不急著。现在人是太急著了。太急著是逼死自己,等于自己没有时间,你急死吗?他又好急死,连要活,你急死吗?不要急,手脚轻快,心里安定。现在是心里很方,等著手脚很慢,找不到的。手脚轻快,心里要很安定,脑筋要很清楚,脚步要很稳。祖父大家越来越好。
