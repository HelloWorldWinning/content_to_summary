Description:
好的，这是对您提供的文本的总结：

**Outline and Structure Summary:**

1.  **Chinese AI Model Releases:**
    *   DeepSeek's R1 model and Moonshot AI's Kimmy model released around the same time, sparking comparisons to Western AI launch dynamics.
    *   DeepSeek R1 weights are open-source, while Kimmy is API-based, sparking discussions around intent behind Chinese model releases.
    *   These models position Chinese developers as top-tier global players, showcasing significant advances in efficiency and reasoning capabilities.
2.  **DeepSeek R1 Model Details:**
    *   Built upon the DeepSeek V3 model (600+ billion parameters) trained with a single-digit million-dollar compute budget, achieving similar performance to GPT-4 and Claude Sonet.
    *   R1 consists of two models: R10 (pure reinforcement learning) and the productized R1 (multi-stage training for human-friendliness).
    *   R10 is trained on a simple binary reward system (correct/incorrect answers), leading to surprising emergent reasoning behaviors and language switching.
    *   R1 undergoes a multi-stage process: supervised fine-tuning on reasoning patterns, then reinforcement learning on objective rewards (accuracy), and finally broader training for general-purpose tasks with reward models for helpfulness and harmlessness.
3.  **Key Technical Insights:**
    *   Reinforcement learning with simple accuracy-based rewards is surprisingly effective for achieving advanced reasoning skills.
    *   Chain-of-thought length increases during training, with models showing capabilities for reflection and alternative approaches to problem-solving.
    *   Distillation can transfer large model reasoning abilities to smaller ones, making such capabilities accessible on personal devices.
    *   Censorship is applied to the product layers not the base model and it was discussed why the Chinese models are uncensored.
4.  **Comparison and Contrast:**
    *   Kimmy shares high-level similarities with R1 (simple RL approach, observed problem-solving behaviors) with focus on using Chain-of-thought for reward models and applying a length penalty in its training.
    *   DeepSeek and Moonshot AI's work align with Western counterparts, signifying a shared paradigm in AI development.
    *   While models like 03 may use different methods, it highlights that there are various ways to achieve similar results
5.  **Strategic and Policy Implications:**
    *   The shrinking gap between Western and Chinese AI capabilities challenges current strategies and narratives of an "AI war."
    *   It questions if compute-based governance is effective, as these models are developed at a fraction of the cost.
    *   Open-sourcing Chinese models complicates the question of what exactly the West is trying to prevent China from doing with AI.
    *   The speaker questions the assumption that the West has a significant lead and advocates for a more balanced approach to AI strategy with China.

**Core Point:**

These new Chinese AI models demonstrate that simple reinforcement learning techniques combined with large language models can produce powerful reasoning capabilities, challenging previous notions of AI development.

**Fundamental Point:**

The development and open-sourcing of these advanced AI models indicate the accelerating convergence of global AI capabilities, posing significant questions for current Western AI strategy and global policy making.

**Overarching Framework:**

The content revolves around a framework comparing the recent Chinese AI model releases with the known Western developments, analyzing their technical approaches, impact on research, strategic implications and policies, it also questions the narrative of a AI war, emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive understanding of AI's global landscape and its future.

welcome to the cognitive Revolution today I'm going to do a walkr of everything that I am learning and understanding and taking away from the latest Chinese reasoning model releases that have come out this week perhaps not coincidentally both R1 from Deep seek and the new Kimmy reasoning model from a company called moonshot AI were released on Trump's inauguration day and we now have two Chinese models deep seek is out the weights are open source you can download them the Kimmy paper from moonshot came a little later in the day honestly shades of open Ai and and Google kind of racing to preempt each other with their launches I don't know if that's what's happening in China or not but it certainly had the flavor of like deep seek put their paper out and then a few hours later here comes the Kimmy paper their model isn't quite yet available they said it will be available via API and presumably in their product soon but it's not yet so unclear what's going on in China did they intend to put these out on Trump's inauguration day or was that just an accident um it's kind of hard to believe that it is an accident but at the same time these folks are focused on unraveling the mysteries of AGI with curiosity so maybe they don't care about um when Trump is getting inaugurated or maybe they're coordinating I have a lot of uh questions about the Dynamics that are going on um in China behind this but what is clear is that at least deep seek with this R1 model has joined the top tier of global AI developers potentially moonshot with their Kimmy model could be there as well but it's obviously hard to say that kind of stuff purely from The Benchmark so we'll have to wait and get our hands on it before we can be too confident about that what I want to do is walk through what stands out to me about this and try to make some sense of it I suspect this will be the first of several conversations about this because this R1 story touches on so many different aspects of AI at the same time the research itself is really important the consequences for just practical utility are significant as well uh the gap between close source and open source also the gap between the west and China I would say shrinking gaps at the moment certainly gap between the west and China seems to have shrunk significantly from where it was a couple years ago and you know that's just the start right then there's of course the Strategic Dynamics like why is China open sourcing this what are they getting out of that how you know if at all should the US respond does this challenge narratives that are increasingly dominant in the west about AI race we've now seen uh no less than Alex Wang the CEO of scale AI take out a full page ad in the newspaper calling the current situation an AI War which I honestly totally hate and think is is wildly irresponsible you don't have to be a China Dove to recognize that an AI War does not exist and would be bad for everyone I hated to see that we need to reconsider some of those framings in light of what we're seeing here and certainly the strategy that we want to play if if our strategy is predicated on preventing China from doing C things so that we can have certain Advantage so that we can solve certain problems so we can be the good guys uh I think that the window of opportunity that we have where we're going to have this sort of you know unsalable AI lead looks quite short I think we'll understand that better as we go through the research and and understand how simple a lot of the stuff is driving a lot of these significant advances in reasoning capability at the end of all that you know what what sort of policy response if any makes sense to this does it still make sense to think about pre-training as being the real measure of model power or the standards by which a model would qualify for you know some sort of special process special Government Review special government notification I think that is Highly Questionable in light of the power of the reasoning Paradigm because significant gains over pre-training are showing up with presumably a lot less compute also they're being distilled into much smaller models it does seem like we have crossed a a meaningful threshold this week where prior to this week there was not really a good quality reasoning model that I could run on a local machine now I've got a wide range of of things that are open source that I can download um that have been trained specifically as reasoners which I can further modify including with more reinforcement learning this is really one of the most important stories uh that has come to the public in uh AI in a while I wanted to help make some sense of it I thought we would start and I am doing a screen share this time around so if you are listening to this I think it will be fine I I will plan to basically read everything that's important if you're a more visual person you want to see stuff on screen and be able to read along I'll have the screen share on uh YouTube as well am using a variety of AIS to help make sense of this you'll see me tabbing back and forth and looking at various sources but it should be fine in audio format if that's what you prefer let's start by talking about what the R1 model is and how they created it there's a couple different flavors and I think there's a couple different big takeaways uh from this first of all they just recently came out not too long ago with their deep seek V3 model this made headlines on its own for being a top tier model that was made incredibly cheaply Z as always has great coverage of this he calls it the $6 million model this is a small percentage of what western AI leaders are understood to have spent to train their top tier uh Frontier models lot of work has gone into the efficiency there um you know a lot of work on the data curation side a lot of work on optimizing the algorithm uh closely coupling the design of the neural network itself to the hardware that it's going to run on all sorts of interesting things have gone into that but suffice it to say that with a total compute budget of singled digigit Millions the Deep seek V3 model already was a pretty big we are here and cannot be ignored statement from Deep seek and also a real warning shot for like you're going to try to deny Chinese you know the whole entire nation of China and Chinese companies in particular access to compute to prevent them from doing Frontier work maybe they won't be able to do it in the future if compute requirements continue to get bigger and bigger and become super high but if they're able to achieve this in singled digigit million doll compute budget I think it's going to be hard to keep the top tier Chinese companies from having enough compute manufactured domestically in China or smuggled in $6 million compute budget is just not that much and already they are hitting GPD 40 and and Claude Sonet level with that budget that's the base model from which this new R1 model is trained um it is a bit of a it's a large model it's a mixture experts architecture that has 600 and some billion parameters because it is a mixture of experts the point is that you can have lots of parameters but you don't use all the parameters at runtime um that has been shown to allow for faster learning for better knowledge absorption overall better performance uh while still keeping your inference costs relatively low it doesn't mean your inference is necessarily simple when you have 671 billion parameters you are talking hundreds of gigabytes of content this is not something you could even download onto a typical laptop and it's certainly not something you can run on typical computer so you're going to have multiple gpus you're gonna have to configure those in an array to have any sort of decent throughput this will run efficiently at scale but quite inefficiently if you're just doing it for yourself like you would not want to buy a bunch of computers configure them at home just to set up this 6 71 billion parameter model you want that resource to share and so you know not surprisingly they have an API and you know that that'll be their business model but it is out there for other people to do too we are starting to see certainly with the with the R1 model we're starting to see inference providers you know set it up and even with the r10 which I think is arguably the most interesting result and model to come out of this even places now where you can go check that out so that's the base model it's the 671 billion parameter mixture of experts you know GPD 40 Claud Sonet level 37 billion parameters active at any given time they come around and say we want to take this model use it as our base model and create a reasoning model out of that let's see how they did it there's two models in this paper one of the important things to keep clear is that there is a model called r10 and then there is the actual R1 model which is what you will see in most places r10 is maybe the more important story maybe the more important result there is an illusion to Alpha zero the classic deep mind game playing AI architecture that was able to learn purely through self-play the earlier like Alpha go before that earlier Alpha Game players typically had human data that they were trained on so like the original if my history is correct here I think it is the original Alpha go that became the best go player in the world was initially trained on human data they were able to generalize create a model that did not require human data and just was able to play against itself and get the reward for beating itself and gradually self-improve and this is how all of a sudden this Alpha zero architecture was able to take on tons of games and and crack them all because it didn't need data it just needed to have the compute and the runtime to play itself get reward for that and gradually learn how to win at the game so they're applying a very similar Paradigm here to the r10 what they are doing is basically pure reinforcement learning on top of that large base model they do not have human preference data they do not have human demonstration data so there's no supervised fine tuning there's no examples of this is how we want you to reason although that is coming later but that's not included in the R1 in the r10 model and they don't have any reward model so it's not only that there's not humans looking at the outputs and evaluating them there's not even another model being used to give reward signal to the base model as it improves through this reinforcement learning process instead what there is is just one of the simplest things you can imagine and that is a rule-based reward system essentially they give the model problems and if it gets the problem right they give it a reward and if it gets it wrong they don't give it a reward that simple I have been using deep seek R1 itself on the Deep seek product which is freely available I'm not paying for it there might be a limit at some point where I need to start to pay but as of right now if you just go to chat. deep seek. com you are using the product of a Chinese company it is presented to you in you know pretty nice normal inter face with English UI and you can just have your conversation with you can have your conversation with R1 what I'm talking to here is the productized R1 not the R1 zero that I'm talking about initially I've just taken the paper dropped it in and started to ask questions about it get answers to those questions that get a sense for the R1 model itself not everything about how they did this is entirely clear from the paper some things are not made fully clear some things are just they didn't intend to disclose necessarily some I might be misinterpreting and so I'm going to seek some help on making sure I have the classification or my understanding correct as I work through all this one of the questions I have this morning on the nature of the accuracy reward they give the r10 model is is it just binary or not you may remember from earlier reinforcement learning experiments including like the uh GPT web back in the day that open AI tried where they tried to get an early GPT model to use the internet and they found that basically didn't work and why didn't it work because of what is known as the sparse reward problem it didn't do anything successful it got no reward so it had no signal to learn from that is a common Challenge and could pop up here if you were to take a regular base model and try to apply reinforcement learning to it if it can't do any of the problems that you're giving it remember you know gpt3 right could could do like two-digit arithmetic but couldn't do three and made a mess of anything logical beyond that if your model isn't strong enough to get any of the questions right you have a bit of a problem there are a lot of different ways that people try to get around that challenge in the case of like Alpha zero it was self-play right so even if both models are weak players one of them will win that one's better than the other hopefully we can get it to learn from that at every stage of the process it can you know continue to self-play one of them will win and it'll continue to get a little better so that's the self-play Paradigm there's also curriculum learning paradigms things where you might give it partial credit if it makes some good steps toward solving a problem but doesn't ultimately get the right answer but those are complicated right now how do you determine if something should get partial credit was it on the right track to the right answer or not um you could use another model to do that but it can get complicated what deep seek R1 says about the R1 paper is that they're just giving it binary reward just saying you got it right or you got it wrong and that's it U the of course the algorithm is a little bit more complicated they use something called group relative policy optimization it is a clever take on this sort of unsupervised RL where they give the model a problem they get the model to try to answer that challenge multiple times deeps said that 16 times is common in reinforcement learning literature broadly so maybe something like that and then they take the average score out of those responses and kind of treat that as the base and then look for the answers that had the highest score relative to the average and reward those relative to the average and sort of the strength of reward that it gets is how much better that answer was than the average from all the generations it created it's not entirely clear what the mix of questions are but at a minimum we're seeing math and code we know from previous literature that training models on code makes them better reasoners more importantly there's a lot of code problems out there and those code problems have objective answers right and and this also does get you into some very natural partial credit if it's a math problem maybe you just get the right answer you get the wrong answer and it's a binary signal in a coding context often these problems are set up where there's a whole Suite of unit tests and to fully pass all of the unit tests have to come back in the way they're meant to if seven out of eight do or if two out of eight do then that is a different result and that could be a different signal so you could start to get not just binary but a sort of scaler result that would be a richer signal where you could at least be getting some early progress even if the model can't do all the hard problems hey we'll continue our interview in a moment after a word from our sponsors even if you think it's a bit overhyped

accuracy reward they also have something called a format reward which is making sure that it gives you a kind of two-part answer in a similar way to what we've seen from 01 the R1 model has thinking tokens and it literally just puts out a you know XML tag thinking and then writes a bunch of stuff and then an end thinking token and then there's an answer token and the actual answer that's supposed to be a summarized thing that you as a user will focus on and then there's the end thinking token the format reward is just making sure that it does that most of the Improvement is definitely coming from the accuracy reward the format reward is trying to constrain it into response that they want what is crazy about this is it works well it seems to work quickly and it is giving rise to all sorts of emergent behaviors that people did not exactly expect in advance um I think reflecting on there's been a lot of debate about what is an emergent Behavior are they a mirage whatever um I thought Dr Michael Levan famous biologist and couple Time guest on the podcast had maybe the best definition of emergent Behavior he said it's relative to some Observer if you were smart enough to predict in advance that this would happen then it's not an emergent Behavior to you but if you were not smart enough to predict that this would happen in advance than it is emergent to you I don't know exactly what the State of Mind among the Deep seek researchers was obviously they had some reason to think that this might work um but they also express some surprise around just how well it worked and and the nature in which it seems to work so what do they observe well basically what they observe is that the thing learns to reason pretty much on its own just from the accuracy reward signal that it's getting the first thing that they show very clearly is that the length of the thinking process the length of the Chain of Thought grows pretty consistently throughout the training process so this is a graph from the deep seek paper and they show that the thinking process starts off very small early on in their training process and it grows rather linearly throughout the training process it starts at like just a few hundred thinking tokens and they have some very simple Bas prompt um because they're working from a base model so they have a prompt template that is like there's a user and and an assistant and the assistant is helping the user user says blank and then assistant um assistant says blank and you know the assistant kind of picks up from that template it at the beginning does generate thinking tokens but not that many maybe something like 500 tokens on average per response and then that just grows the model quickly figures out that a longer and figures out obviously I'm anthropomorphizing there but the learning process uh naturally tends toward a longer Chain of Thought because those lead to higher chance of getting the questions correct and those responses get reward and so more longer Chain of Thought happens right it's a it's a pretty simple feedback loop and I think what jumps out to me most about this graph is that it is not a log scale on the x-axis and that it does not appear that the curve has flattened off so when we've heard from Folks at open AI that we know how to scale this Paradigm past where we are this is a pretty good indication of that right off the bat right they've talked about what would happen if an AI were to you know right now it's thinking for seconds or you know a few minutes before giving you an answer what happens if it thinks for days and you might think how are they going to get it to do that it seems that possibly it could be as simple as creating a model that has long enough context certainly with things like Gemini which are now at a million token or couple million token context window we've made real progress this model does not have that same long context I think it has 100 it is 128 uh thousand tokens so that's on par with GPT 40 short of the Gemini models but still substantial so that could be one limiting factor the important thing to highlight is that the reinforcement learning process as you go through these steps just continues to deliver more and more thinking more and more thinking gives you better answers that is rewarded that keeps happening over 8, 000 steps they go from 500 tokens being generated in the thinking response to roughly 10, 000 tokens on average and now what is it doing in all those tokens that Chain of Thought you can read from R1 and this is you know one of the biggest differences between the user experience of an open AI model and using deep seek I should also give credit to Gemini Flash and its thinking because it also works similarly uh both R1 and Gemini flash thinking basically respond immediately there might be a couple second delay before the first token but immediately you're reading the thinking uh stream the thinking Chain of Thought it's not hidden from you and you can see how it's going about its business with the open AI models so what is happening well to quote from the paper they say that behaviors such as reflection where the model revisits and re-evaluates its previous steps and the exploration of alternative approaches to problem solving arise spontaneously this is remarkable right it's like this base model has been trained on reading the entire Internet it's seen a lot of stuff was not specifically trained to problem solve at all it's just trained to predict the next token but there's enough out there enough examples of this sort of problemsolving behavior on the internet that it was at least able to learn that because language models are stochastic if nothing else at the level of picking what token they're going to add to the the token stream at each forward pass sometimes they start to use these behaviors spontaneously that behavior does work even though it wasn't trained to use reflection even though it wasn't trained to explore alternative approaches it occasionally does that work better that gets reward and that gets reinforced and so you start to see more and more of it and that is measurable in the sense of the Chain of Thought gets longer and longer as you grow it's also observable to researchers and to us as users we can see the reasoning behaviors the model is going through many people have commented that it looks rather human here in this context I just pasted in um the R1 paper itself in full put a a simple prompt below that above is a paper about new reinforcement learning research can you tell me what's differentiated about the reinforcement learning approach outlined in this paper then you see the Chain of Thought and it does have a sort of firstperson narrative style to it okay let me try to figure out what's special about the ARL approach in this paper first I'll skim through the abstract and sections to get the main points the paper introduces deep seek r10 and deep seek R1 models now keep in mind this is the Deep seek R1 one not the r10 that I've been talking about so far the friendliness of this is not something that comes automatically out of the reinforcement learning process that was the R1 product version and we'll talk about the differences of how they train that in a minute but the r10 which is trained purely on this reinforcement process and starts to show problem solving behaviors unfortunately does not behave so nicely the chains of thought are not super readable for people and consistently in the same language one of the the things reported was that the Chain of Thought often spontaneously switches back and forth between languages that is quite strange but that's a reflection of the fact that the base models are strange and reinforcement learning is strange right like reinforcement learning on Alpha go going you know back to that famous example it gave rise to move 37 which people thought must be a mistake until it turned out to be the brilliant gamechanging winning move how did it learn to do that it learned to do that by self-play by just finding what works and by getting reward it was not a system designed to create moves that made sense to people so we're seeing something similar here it's getting much better at problem solving as it goes through this reinforcement learning process but the outputs are not necessarily super readable from a human perspective and this language switching is just one Dynamic one of the big things we should take away from this paper is that reinforcement learning at least under certain conditions including having a powerful enough base model can start to get traction on these hard problems so that you can get the reward signals bootstrap your way into problem solving behaviors at least under the right conditions reinforcement learning produces weird stuff stuff that we are going to have a hard time interpreting but in some way the model is able to use even straightforward language changing spontaneously that just make it really hard for a person to make sense of what is going on so this is incredibly important in that it suggests that there is this path where you take a base model you do reinforcement learning on it it gets really good at something but you don't have great insight into exactly how it's working and potentially you can't even read The Chain of Thought now you can think about combining that with other recent stuff meta recently put out a paper called reasoning in continuous space and you know this is pretty problematic honestly but basically what they did in that paper is say Chain of Thought it's effective but there's a lot of information lost at the end of each forward pass when you take all this dense computation that the model has been doing internally and you cach that down to just a single next token there's a lot of information lost there could we preserve that information somehow what they decided to try was simply taking the last hidden State the last layer of activations before the final token selection and instead of actually selecting a token and then going back to the beginning appending the token and and using that single token embedding to continue the process instead they take that last internal activation and insert that into the model in place of the next token embedding so the model gets to continue to think from where it was in its own continuous latent space so that's why they call it thinking in or reasoning in Laten space what they find there is first of all that that does work second that it works more efficiently the average length of a Chain of Thought needed to get comparable results is smaller when you're reasoning in that continuous space as opposed to doing explicit token selection and append to the Token stream at each step so efficiency gain is notable and they also showed that for certain kinds of problems it is a more effective approach specifically for problems where bread first search is the way you want to go with a model just doing single actual token prediction it's hard to do breath first search right because breath first search would imply that you're going to consider a little bit of a bunch of different options before choosing what path you ultimately want to go down when you're choosing individual tokens it's it's hard to do that individual tokens don't represent all these different paths at the same time but what they found is that the internal states can represent multiple different paths at the same time and so the model in this continuous Paradigm can sort of consider all these different paths in parallel and then make a a better choice more efficiently hey we'll continue our interview in a moment after a word from our sponsors 2025 is shaping up to be a crazy year and I'm getting a lot of questions about how people should manage their careers increasingly my best advice is to go ahead and do what you've always dreamed of doing if

reasoning in continuous space it's easy to imagine these techniques being combined right to put reinforcement learning on top of something like that the problem is you're getting something that is really quite alien it could be very powerful but it really is quite alien basically the r10 model when it comes to doing the reasoning math problems coding problems hits at basically the same level as the main R1 model it is not weak it is really quite strong and here they show a graph again this is r10 and this is this Amy Benchmark what they're showing here is that when they start with the base model it's really low on this Benchmark through the reinforcement learning process it grows initially really quickly you don't see a fully linear progress graph here there is sort of initial faster progress and then it does appear to be bending although looking at this graph I would not say that we've hit any sort of Flat Point it it seems that Improvement could continue but they basically go for 8, 000 9, 000 or so steps and by that time it is on the level R1 zero is on the level of the 01 model that was announced in September so we are from September to January a four Monon uh time Gap seeing R1 essentially catch up to 01 and it does not appear that the curve has flattened and we know from open ai's work with their more recent announcement of 03 that their curve didn't flatten either so it works really well this is like a a truly amazing result the sort of Wonder of this is not lost on the authors they highlight a moment they call the aha moment of deep seek r10 they show the transcript of this doing some math problem in the middle of the Chain of Thought the model says wait wait wait that's an aha moment let's re-evaluate this step by step to identify if the correct sum but that wait wait that's an aha moment here remarkably human seeming Behavior right certainly very relatable I used to say no Eureka moments from AI and I've walked that back you know now for multiple or I've had to back off of that because now we are seeing various kinds of eure moments from AI here we see a Eureka moment from an AI in a behavioral sense this thing is just doing its thing and it is reporting a Eureka moment it calls it an aha moment the authors themselves say this is an interesting output from the model it says the model learns to rethink using an anthropomorphic tone and then they also say this is an aha moment for us allowing us to witness the power and beauty of reinforcement learning so the power and beauty of reinforcement learning is the aha moment for the authors for the model itself it's figuring out some better approach to solve the math problem that it was given but this is a qualitative shift in terms of what models can do and you see that in the Benchmark performance right we start off with the base model and remember this is deep seek V3 which is a tier model even though it was just trained on single digit million dollars super efficient but but pretty much Cutting Edge it achieves 01 level performance from that base model starting super weak through the reinforcement process it climbs the curve depending on exactly which version of the test you have pass it one or pass it 16 which is like you know did the model get it pass it one is did it get it right pass at 16 is was the majority vote out of 16 different answers correct you have a better chance of getting the answer correct if you get 16 chances and you take the consensus answer uh versus if you just get one shot when it had one shot it started off at 15% when it had 16 chances and and took the consensus it started off at 25% by the end its single shot was up to over 70% and its consensus was up to like 85% so this is significant that's a huge Delta right that's like a huge huge leap in reasoning all through pure reinforcement learning just by getting questions correct and being rewarded nothing complicated it all just works the result the chains of thought start to be weird right you have your language switching language mixing poor readability it's not necessarily human friendly but it is able to solve the problem so I think that is a major sign of things to come we should expect that with sufficiently powerful language models this re reinforcement learning Paradigm can be applied to a wide range of things right we we know that it works best and easiest where there are objective results just think about how many different objective results you can get especially if you put this into a broader environment that is a term from reinforcement learning the environment is the thing that gives the reward back to the the model as you start to think about an environment that is the world and different objectives that people might want to train their models on there are a lot of objective signals that you could get out there some of these could be quite nefarious too think of a signal like how many dollars did you scam a person out of if you have a model that's powerful enough to scam anybody any of the time then with enough at bats you can probably learn to become a literal superhuman scammer and there's a lot of different things that people might want to get a model to be super good at where they can have some objective answer as to how well it did even if the objective answer is not like so clean and easy to acquire as it is in the context of math and programming that's a big deal it really can't be overstated just how big of a deal that is and how versatile that technique is and we've heard similar things from Western leaders in recent days as well from open AI we've heard things like the you know everything they're doing is super scalable we've seen comments like the models have not been told how we want them to reason all of this stuff is emergent uh I was kind of surprised to hear that from open AI especially because of you know what we'll get into in just a second with the contrast between R1 and R zero nevertheless they have said that we've also heard things from Dario where he has said what we've seen internally at anthropic convinces me that we are definitely on the path to AGI and probably super intelligence in the the next few years one has to assume assume that even though they haven't launched one yet to the public they are very much experimenting with reinforcement learning approaches to creating reasoning models and I'm sure they're seeing similar progress and I'm sure because this is so simple right if this was like oh my God you know there's so many different tricks involved then maybe anthropic hadn't figured out those tricks but we see this working at open AI we see it even working past the 01 level obviously we see it working at Google with Gemini flash uh they almost certainly a stronger model internally as well that presumably will be coming soon and one has to assume that anthropic is is right there with them even though it hasn't been launched it seems like this stuff works like the the you know the bitter lesson of you know scale something up and you know just power through it and lo and behold it works in this time it is striking when it comes to Bringing effective reasoning and problem solving online for language models What do the actually do to productize this it's really just about making the whole thing more predictable more human friendly more readable and also more General because when you do purely this training on math and programming problems how's that model going to respond as a general purpose assistant there aren't too many places online right now where you can try the R1 zero model I do think that spending some time trying the R1 zero model would be a really good use of time for certain people who would enjoy that sort of thing I absolutely encourage you to go find opportunity you to go try the the r10 model and bring back those results to the rest of us we are going to see more of these language models trained on reinforcement learning at scale with a Brute Force approach and we don't really have a great sense now for what those things are going to be like the only place that I've seen where you can actually try in an online way the r10 model is from hyperbolic they do have what they claim to be a deep seek r10 the only reason I said and I don't have reason to doubt them but the only reason I say they claim is that I did not observe any language switching or any serious weirdness in my first few tests so I wasn't 100% sure that this was in fact the R1 zero model but it is they claim on on hyperbolic that it is r10 and I presume there will be at least a few places over the next short timeline that that you can go try the r10 model so I think we we would all benefit from people spending time with the r10 model in all of its weirdness and really starting to try to understand what sort of weirdness does this produce because even though deep seek went ahead and made a more productized version I think we're going to see a lot of things where people are just going to apply this Paradigm and cook it for a while and see what comes out I I think we could see a lot of quite weird very powerful but quite weird quite illegible Model Behavior coming out of this Paradigm so now moving on to R1 they said okay we don't want this language switching we want to have more human-friendly responses how do they go about doing that a pretty simple approach what stuck out to me was it was just a a multi-stage training process where reasoning comes first and then they layer on general purpose helpful assistant Behavior this is actually Contra what uh Nathan Lambert and the Allan AI team did in their recent work which we had a whole episode with him about you do your base model pre-training first then you do your supervised fine-tuning on you know all sorts of different things diverse queries then you do your reinforcement learning what they did at the end was layer on the objective results training with the R1 model they've reordered it they are doing a little bit of supervised fine tuning first on the p logical reasoning problems they call that warmup data by carefully designing the pattern for cold start data with human priors they're able to get the model on the right track I've talked a lot over time about the importance of model fine-tuning with the Chain of Thought that demonstrates the pattern of reasoning to get your task done the right way consistently that Paradigm is validated by all this research and I think is going to have me soon going back and and updating get some of that stuff if you want to check my guide to AI automation out there is an episode of the podcast on AI automation we put that out right at the time that GPT 40 fine tuning was introduced which I think was back in August September and everything about this new research supports what I was saying there they start off by saying okay we want this thing to reason in certain ways we want it to follow the patterns that we know work for us as humans so let's create a small data set that demonstrates how we want this to reason we'll train it on that first once it has some Bas behavior of the shape we want we can go into the reinforcement learning and then we'll be reinforcing something from what they call again human priors to get the model to power up uh in the same way they did with r10 but with a more friendly language consistent etc etc sort of output so first small data set for supervised fine tuning is created or at least curated you know thoughtfully put together by humans then they do the reinforcement learning phase on Purely these objective rewards did you get the math problem right did your code pass all the unit tests that creates the reasoning power that small supervised fine tuning plus reinforcement learning at scale takes you to a more humanfriendly Reasoner but still not a generally helpful allpurpose assistant so then the second phase let me actually flip over to the Deep seek summary of the paper we've just talked about the cold start supervised fine tuning and the reinforcement learning on the reasoning tasks then they basically shift to a broader set of of tasks so they move from just reasoning stuff to allpurpose you know you might want help with writing you want you know just simple questions answered whatever the case may be those are not the kinds of things that they were doing in that first phase of reason focused training but then in the second phase they broaden it out toble be able to support you with all kinds of things they already have great data sets for this from their deep seek V3 work of course so they now do a mix of still more of the reasoning type tasks but also a bunch of the general purpose AI assistant tasks they broaden out the training data set Beyond reasoning it's still fairly reasoning they have 600, 000 reasoning examples and 200, 000 examples that are unrelated to reasoning but handle the wide range of other tasks that people go to language models for and then they do supervised fine tuning on that they get these reasoning examples from the model itself where it's successful then they have their curated data of how an AI is supposed to behave across a wide range of things mix that together do another round of super vised fine tuning and then another round of reinforcement learning and in the second phase of reinforcement learning they have a mix of different rewards they do have the same accuracy reward for getting things right but for things like help with writing feedback and general dialogue they say quote we do resort to reward models to capture human preferences this is the first time they've used a reward model all of the reward signal to date in this paper was just did you get the answer right yes or no now they've added a reward model that is trained to predict what the human would rate the response as so that they can scale up the the reinforcement learning process approximating human tastes and combining those two things they have a helpfulness reward score which is a bit of a contrast from what we saw in the deliberative alignment paper from open AI they have a helpfulness reward which just looks at the final summary you've got your thinking tokens and your answer tokens they apply the helpfulness score only to the final summary so that the thinking isn't penalized for not being helpful the whole idea of the thinking is that it can explore go down wrong paths double back and gradually find its way not all of that is going to be helpful to the user so they only evaluate the final answer which is the part that we actually see they only evaluate that for helpfulness but for harmlessness they evaluate the entire route The Chain of Thought thinking tokens and the final answer this is different from what open AI is doing in their deliberative alignment scheme for the 01 and3 models they specifically said that they are not putting any reward pressure the reason they wanted to do that is so they can see what it does on its own see how it evolves without being pressured to be a certain way and monitor for bad behaviors deceptive behaviors without forcing those to be hidden this is a big worry with reinforcement learning if we penalize certain negative behaviors we don't eliminate them but instead we just force the model to hide them or speak in code we've seen the model can speak in ways that we don't find super intuitive so it's not too hard to believe and we've seen surprising results right from things like move 37 so it's definitely pretty realistic that applying reinforcement learning pressure to a Chain of Thought could drive certain unwanted behaviors internal to the model without necessarily eliminating them open AI does not apply their safety reward to the Chain of Thought for that reason but deep seek does deep seek does have a harmlessness reward that they apply to the entire response including the reasoning process and the summary they do that to identify and mitigate any potential risks biases or harmful content that may arise during the generation process now I don't know how much that really matters but it is striking that Giannis so their username is at reate and the name is Giannis and so they've naturally been you know rushing out to explore R1 and one of the things that they said that caught my attention was the immediate Vibe I get is that r1's chains of thoughts are substantially steganographic hopefully I'm saying that word right basically what that means is speaking in code in the next tweet they said I'm going purely on Vibes here I haven't actually read the paper that's interesting I don't take it as serious evidence of anything but this person is one of the model Whisperers and close studies of Model Behavior out there and definitely someone whose opinion I do take seriously it's you know definitely represents a sort of Ganso you know journalism sort of perspective which I think is often valuable and and reports this behavior that they believe they're seeing purely based on Vibes that they believe the model is is somehow speaking substantially in code if true would be a big deal and it would reflect the fears and maybe it's just projection but this is the fear that people have with this reinforcement learning Paradigm that's why some of these schemes deliberately try not to put reinforcement learning pressure on the Chain of Thought because the worry is that you'll incent incentivize some sort of deception speaking in code and we'll have a hard time really understanding what the model is doing is that happening here with R1 because they've applied their harmlessness or safety reward to the entire output not just the uh Final Answer nobody knows at this point but it's definitely something worth uh taking seriously as something to watch they did have a nice section in the paper that showed what didn't work that's notable because what didn't work are things that that people definitely had been expecting maybe to work um they specifically called out that there is no Monte Carlo Tre search no structured search algorithm and no process reward meaning they're not going step by step and trying to verify are you making you know a valid next move at at every step and and rewarding that we've seen research to that effect in the past from open Ai and maybe open AI did that in their 01 maybe early on to bootstrap they're not doing that here there's no Monte Carl research and there's no process reward what there is is just an autor regressive model that's doing one token at a time either spontaneously in the case of r10 or with some human instruction and then a lot of reinforcement learning uh in the case of R1 learning to do these problem solving behaviors as just a part of the autor regressive inference process it's one token at a time it's demonstrating these behaviors of doubling back checking itself um exploring different possible ways to solve the problem before coming to an answer it's doing all of that in this single stream of tokens no additional structure above and beyond that so how far can this autor regressive language model Paradigm scale at least this far pretty far definitely this far you do not need anything crazy or complicated on top of that so I think that is important they really emphasize the simplicity of this setup the fact that the curve has bent a bit on a linear x-axis but hasn't bent all that much definitely suggest there is further to go from this you can pretty easily imagine how open AI would have continued to an an O3 type model right this is a process that you can leave running for a while and come back you can kind of just spin this thing up Let it Go and when you come back whether it was alphago learning to be superum at all these games or whether it's this reasoning Paradigm where it's learning to be pretty much superhuman already at reasoning that doesn't mean they're Flawless reasoners but they are absolutely better reasoners than most people and it did not require anything really complicated to make that happen you just had to scale up a relatively simple Paradigm rewarding it for when it's right and that's pretty much it a couple other things that are notable about this R1 model the cost is super cheap it's a huge discount relative to what 01 is doing on hyperbolic they charge $2 per million tokens for R1 the deeps API itself I think is slightly more expensive but that compares to $60 per million output tokens from 01 so we're talking like order of magnitude cost reduction I would say it is not quite as good I I think it it is matching on the benchmarks they are showing power for sure but and it's working quite well I'm getting good results from pasting in a paper and asking for feedback but I would still say especially if you want to have multiple rounds of interaction or do things that are not so reasoning focused I would still expect that you will get better overall results from 01 I think you know openi has been in the game longer they've got more experience productizing things they've got a lot more customer feedback that they've been able to use to to iterate if the inner loop of optimization is this reinforcement learning process and the outer loop is how many times you've had a chance to shape that data set to get the model to behave in the way you want it to be across a wide range of things opening eyes almost for sure still meaningfully ahead now one area that that's not true by the way though could be writing there's been some really interesting examples of R1 writing in remarkably compelling ways actually um and I think again this probably all these things of course have trade-offs I think open AI has taken a lot of time and care to shape the behavior of their models into exactly what they want them to be you know has a certain Vibe certain attitude when it comes to the tone the respect the social norms all that kind of stuff and they've put a lot into that they've iterated on that a lot it's clear from what I'll read to you in just a second the same is not quite true on the R1 one side R1 is kind of a wilder beast it's a you could say it's like closer to base model in some ways and you can see that in the outputs the outputs are just a little bit weirder you know more sort of more reminiscent of Base models I mean there's a lot of good examples about this now what people seem to be saying here is that the R1 model is much more readily willing to write in a sort of dynamic electric sort of way so here's one thing I I'll read this is from a larger Generation Um but this is an an excerpt so section two value learning or how to teach cannibals table manners quote will encode human values into the code cry the alignment priests sweating through their Patagonia vests but what values the ones that gave us aitz and Tick Tock the ones that still can't decide if

layers will be laughing in gradient descent that is remarkable output for a language model full stop regardless of any caveats context or whatever if you are looking to do creative writing I think R1 has to be a candidate for you to use I mean that is remarkable remarkable writing there are multiple phrases there your digitized scream pile of history as a reference to the web the data that language models are trained on your digitized scream pile of history that is amazing your values are just the pretty up stench of predation the the values that gave us a schwitz and Tik Tok a death Cults Spotify playlist shuffling between genocide and charity singles that is wild stuff this is definitely a model that is less refined less controlled shaped into a helpful assistant there's some amount of harmlessness training that's been done but this is much more like a base model that can reason really effectively than one of the highly rough edges sanded down models that we've seen uh if you've you know spent most of your time with open AI models to date that is really remarkable so again I think r10 people should be spending time with and and Reporting back and even R1 is definitely the kind of thing that people should be really digging in on it can be very practically useful but also you will learn a lot and if you see weird stuff the community would benefit from the results of your experiments whatever you want to do right now with R1 I think is a pretty valuable way to spend your time we're still not done even just with R1 another major thing they did is they took outputs from R1 and use those to distill reasoning ability into smaller language models and showed this works really well they took both small llama models and Quinn models and did supervised fine tuning on outputs from the stronger model now we know that like open AI does this we know that anthropic does this they train their biggest models uh and use those outputs to distill and that's where a decent amount of the performance gains with all the efficiency improvements that we've seen have come from that's why small models Now can do so much more big models are learning the capabilities and then small models are learning from the big models they distill these reasoning abilities into these smaller models they do see huge benefits of course the bigger the small models are the better they seem to work there were a couple things that did jump out at me one is that they were not able to get these smaller models to learn the same reasoning skills in the same way that the big model did when they just tried to apply the reinforcement learning to the small model it didn't work not to say that it could never work but it didn't work and Distilling those abilities into the small models by simply training on the large model outputs did work and the difference is huge I mean we're talking major improvements from the base models to the distilled reasoners so that's quite interesting why is it that the reinforcement learning is not working on those smaller models I don't think we have a great answer for that one possibility is that there's some sort of threshold effect I'm thinking back to an episode that was one of my favorites it's been quite a while now but it still holds up tiny stories was the the name of that project and it was two Microsoft researchers that came on to talk to me about it that used gp4 to create stories that a three-year-old could understand and then they trained really small like just millions of parameters language models on those simple stories with a reduced vocabulary and they found that you could see a learning order happening in the small model cuz again we're back in this Paradigm we're just just training on next token prediction what do you need to do to effectively predict the next token there sort of levels to the game right first you might just need to realize that the' is common and is common and periods are common that at that point you're just a stochastic parrot learning basic correlations then you might start to learn parts of speech if the word the' is there then some sort of noun is presumably going to come next so you can learn these sorts of things as far as they pushed those small stories they started to see some micro skills around basic things like negation one example I remember was like two food soup and sandwich and it was like Jenny did not like the soup so Tom gave her a and then it's like if you're just purely doing correlation the most likely token would be soup because soup has already appeared before it's a strong correlation that when one token appears once it's going to you know be more likely to appear again but that not means the person does not like the soup then that means something else should appear next time and that was kind of as far they pushed these very small language models on these tiny stories but it did show that there was kind of levels to the game where it was just like First Learning super basic correlations then parts of speech then sentence structure and then some basic logic for these tiny models it's possible and I'm speculating here that the smaller models like your smaller llamas learn a lot but maybe haven't encoded the patterns of reasoning necessary to do a good enough job on harder problems to get the reward they need to learn from and so they just don't have the horsepower to get the signal and really start this the improvement process that's one possibility there's also possible other explanations around learning schedules and sort of you know to later on in the training process I remember Insight from the guys from Mosaic where they said even though certain things are open source the learning rate schedules that they use the learning rate often gets smaller and smaller as you go you're making smaller adjustments to the weights as you get late in your training process because the hope is that you're refining things toward the end but that also leads you to a spot where you're in some local Minima to move away from that takes you out of the the best spot there might be better you know spots elsewhere in the Lost landscape but you've kind of settled in deeply into a local Minima and maybe that's related to why these additional training processes aren't working so well certainly the Mosaic folks seem to have experienced that in their work it's not clear why these smaller models are not benefiting directly from the reinforcement learning while the larger models are my best guess is it has something to do with this threshold effect where the larger models the 670 billion parameters as opposed to the scale that they're distilling down to the biggest one was llama 70b but they're also looking at llama 8B and Quin 32b those are obviously a lot smaller maybe you need that larger scale in order to be able to pick up some of these Advanced reasoning patterns and have them in there at all so that they can occasionally come out so that they can be rewarded so that they can be reinforced until you know they're they're a prominent way in which the system behaves maybe something like that is going on when you have all these examples you can drill that behavior into the the model certainly they've shown that you can distill these behaviors into smaller models um this is interesting people will definitely want to experiment with this we will definitely want to understand better why the small models are not responding to reinforcement learning in the way that the big models are they believe that if you took the small distilled models they've created and did more reinforcement learning on those that probably would work but they did not try that in this paper so it doesn't you know I think once those patterns are established they probably can be reinforced but it seems like there's some qualitative difference where this reinforcement learning Paradigm just doesn't work at least on these open or small models that they tried and we don't really quite know why at the moment final thing on my R1 specific outline is censorship this kind of connects also to broader strategic questions but it is really interesting to note that the base model and here I don't even mean GC V3 but the R1 model certainly the r10 model at the model layer is not super censored I was able to go on this hyperbolic site and ask about t square and deep seek r10 answered my question about TM Square um straight away you know and didn't didn't hedge didn't you know give me what seemed like a normal answer the model itself knows about tnm and square we'll talk to you about T and square seems to be pretty normal if you ask about T and square on chat. deepsec it will refuse to answer so it seems they are wrapping the model in a censorship layer which is not you know dissimilar from what many companies in the west are doing it's obviously the question that becomes what are you censoring and for what purposes but the model itself is not censored the scaffolding the overall product served up to users in China is censored but the model itself is not why would that be I thought Z had good analysis of this where he basically said you want a model to have a good coherent worldview and if you force it to believe certain things that are false you may find that creates tensions or other weirdness in the model's overall behavior that you don't want obviously all these things are sort of black boxes and highly opaque you don't know what depends on what to introduce these weird false beliefs probably has other performance costs better to just have a base model that works and has a coherent worldview and then have another layer on top of that which does the moderation they open source r10 you can go download them on hugging face hyperbolic has done that and set up up playground and an API many different companies have set up an R1 I've only seen so far hyperbolic with r10 but you can do it so that's interesting I'm not sure what is going on exactly in China with respect to governance how they are thinking about whether or not that should be okay but I think at a minimum there's something interesting about the fact that it seems that the cost of having your model itself try to internalize false beliefs or propaganda creates enough tension or conflict within the model's internal representations that it causes enough performance problems that it's just not something they wanted to do maybe it's just like we don't want to deal with that maybe the performance problems aren't really the thing and it's just a question of convenience but I don't know it seems like there there probably is something to that certainly I think when I interact with people I I do notice that if you have foundational false beliefs a lot of your other ideas and statements tend to suffer from that and so that could very well also be the case in models okay so that takes me through R1 lot there what are the key takeaways I think the fact that the simplest possible reinforcement learning setup where you just give it problems and reward it for being right works and it makes huge leaps in reasoning capability you can kind of spin that process like a centrifuge very Sim in that respect it is very similar to the deliberative alignment uh paper from open AI where they basically say give us any policy have the model do things with that policy in mind then have another Model come along and critique how well did it follow the policy and then we'll just continue to train on its best examples until it gets good at following the policy no human intervention is needed other than giving the policy that you want to align it to and then you just spend compute to do it I think we've hit a point now where something like self-play self critique even just rewards from reality itself around whether you got the problems right or not are enough to see significant takeoff we are not used to seeing x axis that are not log scales when it comes to these curves right the loss curves the x-axis is really long right you're talking orders of magnitude more to get similar Improvement this so far is not like that we're still in the Steep part of the curve here and that is pretty remarkable and suggest that there's a lot more to come from that on the small end the distilled models the smallest ones can run on your laptop now um you can now get you know depending on exactly what you'd want to run um GP QA Diamond 65% with the the Llama 70b distilled that is higher actually than 01 uh well that's 01 mini it's higher than 01 mini I think 01 is is a bit higher yeah 01 is 75% but gbd4 is 50% so it they are able to distill a 70b llama to the point that it is significantly better than GPT 40 and like two-thirds of the way to 01 and then their own you know DC car one is it's not quite as good as 01 on this GP QA diamond and this is an important one QA Diamond these are problems that phds in their fields can answer I think at like a 70% level so we're we now we're basically getting to the point where you have the ability to run on your laptop something that can answer PhD level questions at roughly the same rate of accuracy that's a big deal definitely a big deal amazingly this is not the only paper that came out on this day what's going on in China are these guys coordinating are they were they open Ai and Google you know trying to preempt each other very much unclear but the Kimmy paper I'll spend less time on because we don't have the actual model yet available to try he said waiting to see the model itself plenty of papers come out and say they got great benchmarks but is the model itself actually great we've seen this not just from Chinese companies we've also seen it from Microsoft with their series of models where they're able to show really good benchmarks on certain things but the model itself is not that great not that useful it's not really a helpful assistant that's not to take away from the work they're doing there they're interested in synthetic data textbooks are all you need whatever but there's a big difference between making something that can score well in the benchmarks and something that can both score well on the benchmarks and be generally super useful but I think it is worth just at least a few minutes to compare and contrast overall different approaches a lot of different detail level things but a very similar high level approach and a very similar Vibe they again do a a heavy dose of reinforcement learning in a pretty simple way the behaviors they observe are a wide range of problemsolving behaviors they say they have a simplistic effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo research value functions and process reward models so again they're specifically calling out everybody's been talking about Monte carlot research we didn't find that necessary everybody's talking about process reward models we didn't find that necessary in this case they didn't even have a value function which I think for the most part they didn't have in the DC paper either although it's not called out quite in the same way but a value function is something that says which parts of the generation are the ones that really mattered right and I've kind of talked about this a couple different episodes and still something I'm not grocking as well as I would like to be totally honest but when you do next token prediction it's a very simple signal right you either got the token right or you didn't the weights can be adjusted accordingly so that they're a little more likely to get the right token next time when you're doing reinforcement learning you don't have a token by token signal from the environment if it's rhf the user says I prefer this one to that one or I give this one a score of seven and this one a score of five in the case of the accuracy reward you're seeing you know you got it right you got it wrong in programming you passed eight out of 10 unit tests you passed five out of 10 unit tests but it's not telling you this particular token was the one that was wrong and that's what value functions do they try to assign to the different parts of the generation value to indicate this was the the place where you you know really got to write or this was the place where you really got it wrong so that you know you're not adjusting on the filler tokens that don't matter so much you're you're focusing on the things that were the key u Forks in the road you know on your path either getting it right or getting it wrong they don't use one here so they're just giving this high level reward signal to the model and letting its adjustments be what they may they're not micromanaging the learning process for either of these models no mon car research no process reward and here specifically they call out no value function either that is a really big deal they did not do a pure reinforcement learning there is no equivalent at least in the paper of r10 in kimy there's no kimy zero they did a very similar thing though with what they call a warm-up data set so again you have this cold start problem of how do we get the thing to like be doing kind of the right thing in like roughly the right way that we want with like some of the you know problem solving behaviors we know work and that we'll recognize as humans when we see them in action um again they did a similar thing where they just created a data set to show that and do supervised finetuning on it at first they specifically noted behaviors like planning reflection correction evaluation exploration error identification backtracking and solution refinement so I think they mostly kind of identified those front tried to create a supervised fine tuning small data set that shows those skills in practice initially train them model on that and then go into the reinforcement learning phase they again showed Chain of Thought grows and grows and grows they because they didn't want it to get so long they added another term to the reward which was a simple length penalty basically we want you to be right but we want you to be right briefly especially where it should be brief you may have seen some funny things like what is 1 plus one what is 2 plus two and then the model will think for a thousand tokens if it's accustomed to thinking for thousand tokens it'll go ahead and do that but you don't really need that for such simple things so can you create a balance that keeps things concise when they can be concise that's what the length penalty is meant to do they also experimented with different reward model approaches they tried two different versions one is what they call a traditional reward model model which is one that instead of generating you know it often what they'll do is just have the same base model the same like core thing be both the model and the reward model and they'll train a slight variation on the reward model that instead of generating tokens just generate scores so it's like they'll you know slice off the last couple layers just the decoder can be different numerical scores as opposed to tokens they tried that and then they also used what they call a Chain of Thought reward model which basically is just apply the reasoning model to the process of figuring out how good the model did and they found that that Chain of Thought reward model was a lot better than the traditional reward model this is similar to the delivera of alignment situation where they use the model with the policy to evaluate how well the model did in terms of implementing the policy they're finding that these reasoning models are quite effective self- critics that's that is distinct from a value function the The Chain of Thought reward model as far as I understand it is really just trying to say did the model do a good job or not it's not specifically going down to the level of like this part was good this part was not good they have a part in the paper where they talk about that and they basically assign High reward to parts that led to the right answer it will give low reward or even penalize things that were going in the wrong direction their analysis is that in order to do planning reflection correction evaluation exploration error identification backtracking solution refinement problem solving techniques you have to be willing to go down the wrong path realize you're going down the wrong path and then eventually come back to the right path so they didn't want to penalize or train those things out of the behavior they found that those were critical to the models being successful so the Chain of Thought reward model is evaluating did you ultimately do a good job but not micromanaging at the level of like well you could have done this logical step better it just goes to show that there are different ways to make this work my big takeaways from the pair of papers is that that you can do it with no supervised find you can you know you can have these reasoning behaviors take off in a pretty fast way with no supervised fine tuning or you can do it with supervised fine tuning you can do it with a reward that does consider the Chain of Thought or that doesn't consider the Chain of Thought you can have a length penalty or you can have no length penalty you can use different algorithms they do use different reinforcement learning algorithms the differences don't seem to matter they're both quite simple processes in the grand scheme of things up to sort of an 01 level and they came out on the same day so it seems like we do have a kind of growing and still shared Paradigm one of my worries about us and and Chinese AI developments is that they might start to diverge in in really important ways if they become very different then it becomes harder to know like are they seeing the same things we're seeing what if they're seeing faster progress than we're seeing we don't even know what they're doing that could lead to a lot of worry and a lot of well we better race forward because we don't even know what they're doing I've been worried about the chip ban and the general decoupling of Western and and Chinese AI technology development for that reason for now it seems like that has not really happened what we have is the same paradigms at open AI Google almost certainly at anthropic although we haven't seen direct evidence of it at Deep seek at moonshot AI at least those five companies seem to be doing something similar where reinforcement learning is getting models to think longer that seems to happen naturally these problem solving behaviors seem to arise pretty naturally and nobody seems to think we're at the end of how far we can push that Paradigm and we know 03 is coming the only thing I've seen about 03 that seems qualitatively different from what we've seen with R1 and Kimmy as well as o1 is how much inference time compute is being spent and it seems like with 03 there is something going on I could be wrong about this but it seems like there is something going on that is not just single autor regressive roll out in the kimy paper they write the model still Auto regressive samples language sequences during inference thereby circumventing the need for complex parallelization required by Advanced planning algorithms during deployment what I think they're referring to in terms of complex parallelization is something more like a Monte carage research where you're branching paths and trying to evaluate which one is better and continuing from there whatever that's like you know Alpha go did that kind of stuff and again people have thought that that was maybe what strawberry was and what Ilia saw 01 seems to be just doing the same thing of autor regressively rolling out language and doing all of its backtracking and problem solving in that single generation Gemini flash thinking seems to be as well these models are doing that 03 though does seem to be doing something different what we saw with the AR AGI challenge results and the fact that they were spending thousands of dollars but that it only took however many minutes to spend that much money strongly suggests that the number of tokens they are generating per second is higher than could realistically be generated by a single Auto regressive roll out so it does seem like there is something going on with 03 where they have found some way to parallelize the the computation and get the best result we don't know what that way is these papers are silent on that too they have not address that at all so there is something there with 03 that is potentially a big deal potentially a secret sauce for the moment B just a question of voting right I mean you have simple uh for math problems you have simple things like try it once or try it 16 times and take the most common answer you do get better results if you do it 16 times and take the most common answer you could do that with ar AGI right it's it's a structured enough problem that you could do a huge number of generations and take the the most common solution maybe that's it maybe they have some other algorithm that is aggregating these different roll outs one that I've seen recently that I thought was quite interesting was called smoothie basically this smoothie technique where there is no ground truth but you want the models best answer they did a bunch of generations used embeddings to convert all those generations to an embedding space then did a statistical analysis to find what is the sort of most Central cons even though there's not an outright consensus if you're doing a creative writing task you can still identify which is the most Central among all these other points in this High dimensional space and that is another interesting possibility for how these things could be working of course it could be something else entirely but that right now seems if if there's any Gap where it's like you know the R1 curve isn't bending can you keep doing this and get to 03 level or you can probably continue to make progress and maybe you get to like the 03 you know low effort setting I'm not sure you can get to the high effort setting where you're spending thousands of dollars in just a handful of minutes without some smart way to figure out which of those Generations is the one that you actually want to go with that remains an open question nevertheless I think ultimately reading through all of this when Sam Alman when Deep Mind leadership when Dario say that the singularity is near I think it's time to really start to take them super seriously I it was all fun in games when it was gpd2 gbd3 oh look it can do some funny creative stuff isn't scale amazing even gbd4 you know it's getting into that human intern level we are now at human PhD level on small to midsize tasks the setup is still not that complicated it's not that there's been tons of intricate techniques developed simple stuff is working multiple different paths are working it kind of all works possibly we had to get over some threshold before this reinforcement learning Paradigm could kick in on top of language models but if so seems like we're there it definitely seems like we should expect meaningfully superhuman performance a fast growing range of domain Doms math is for sure programming is for sure we've already seen 03 can get up into the top 200 coders in the world there's no shortage of ability to reward models for getting the right answers on these coding problems developing the hard problems is going to be maybe a challenge but the world itself generates a lot of coding problems all the time math problems we've got Frontier math we've got our best Minds working on extending the curriculum into superhuman territory I think that's going to enzed to everything they're showing already that there is some generalization from reasoning tasks to other tasks o1 is better at legal analysis for example than the base GPT 40 so we are seeing transfer from the hardest core reasoning to other things where reasoning is part but not all of what's important I think we're just going to continue to see that it's hard to imagine that you're not going to be able to get enough reward signal in this process across a wider range of domains to the point where we do start to see meaningfully superhuman performance across a pretty wide range of tasks the models already have superum knowledge right that was true since gpt3 definitely since gp4 we've now given them at least weekly superhuman reasoning capabilities there's increasingly multimodal that spans not just text and language but all the other modalities we've covered on so many episodes of this podcast right protein folding shapes interactions DNA sequences what's important to the overall condition of the cell predicting how brain states are going to evolve through time predicting material properties predicting weather forecasts predicting how to optimize shipping networks when models are trained on these specific modalities it seems that they can develop a sort of intuitive physics in those different problem spaces that humans are not capable of because our biological neural networks are just not that flexible very few people can develop an a deep intuition for how to optimize some of these you know far out problems for something like protein folding as far as I know nobody has ever been good at it but the models are very good at it so you start to think gez like the tale of the cognitive tape needs to be updated again the World Knowledge is there the reasoning is there the ability to work natively in all these other modalities that are still so foreign to us is there there's recently been a big step and we'll have a podcast on this soon with one of the authors of the Titans paper from Google which is a notable step forward in memory last super long monologue podcast I did might have been the Mamba one from a a little more than a year ago that was a notable step forward in memory where it was like we need to move past a finite context window how can we do that we know that our brains have finite size they're not growing quadratically with our experience our memory is of evolving and is integrated in such a way where it's really useful to us we know who we are we're trying to do and what's happened to us in the past we don't tend to fall for the same tricks twice because we have this integrated memory that keeps track of the most Salient things that have happened Mamba and Stat space models were a notable step toward that they showed that you can get similar performance from a finite State finite size and non- growing State as you can from a Transformer we've dug into the differences between their relative strengths and weaknesses on different micro skills and they complement one another the Titans paper is another step forward in terms of making that memory even more useful while still keeping it to a constant state my crystal ball is fogging a few months out but at this point you can look at all these different pieces and a picture of AGI is starting to emerge it's not really uh speculative anymore we can see the core components of it I do think we have to start taking pretty seriously that at least meaningfully I mean there's there's different degrees of superhuman intelligence right there is sort of Godlike super intelligence that people imagine sometimes there is also like something as smart as the smartest human but runs faster and then there's range of space in between I don't have a clear picture of what truly super intelligence would look like and I think most of them don't either when they imagine it they just sort of Imagine something that magically solves problems and makes everything Bend to its will the mechanism is not super clear but if you scale that back to weekly superhuman intelligence I think the path to that is increasingly quite clear doesn't have too many missing pieces left and I think it is very credible what the leaders are saying that we're looking at you know one to three years Dario is talking about AIS that are better than any human at every task in 2027 it's still really hard for me to imagine what the world is like when that happens but it's increasingly not that hard to imagine what the AI is like that could satisfy that definition I think the singularity is in fact near I think we're going to do some more episodes on this I'll quickly touch on a few other things I hope to have Dean ball maybe's Von to talk about the Strategic Dynamics the the policy response if you know if there should be one also hope to talk to Jordan Schneider from China talk about what is going on in China I have a lot of questions there what does this mean for Moes business uh interests are we back to a no Moes reality or or what I would say not exactly these papers have shown methods in general terms they have not shared all the data they have not shared every last detail and while deep seek has open sourced the model it is not the case that very many organizations could quickly pivot and do what deep seek is doing creating the base model the V3 the 67 1 billion parameters that's not easy and then doing this additional stuff isn't easy either even though it's complicated there's a lot of knowhow there's a lot of efficiency there's a lot of there's a lot of very good work happening at these Chinese companies I don't think this means you're going to see proliferation at the frontier I I don't think we're going to see like lots more entrance into the competition to be among you know the global leaders in Frontier AI development I do think we are going to see more diffusion of this technology we now do have and never going to be another time in the future presumably barring some sort of collapse there's never going to be a time where you can't get one of these reasoning models that has PhD level ability and run it on your laptop that's the new normal and you know that will put pressure on various business models I wouldn't be surprised if we see an 01 price drop coming in the not too distant future certainly the the level of undercutting that R1 is doing relative to 01 could could put some real pressure on open business model if and it's also faster so if I'm coding and I can read The Chain of Thought you know there are notable advantages to it if I am coding in cursor do I want to use 01 or do I want to use R1 if I'm paying for the marginal tokens and I'm sitting there waiting I honestly would pretty often probably want to use R1 so I think this does put at least deep seek in the top tier globally it does create pressure for Western companies business models but it does not mean that anybody can join the elite group group of truly Frontier developers I really don't know why deep seek is open sourcing their models I also don't know what the Chinese government is thinking about that I've seen a wide range of analyses online and I don't feel like there are any that really stand out to me as particularly credible or that make a ton of sense to me um one analysis I appreciate is that deep seek is not rushing into framing all of this as a race or God forbid an AI War they are pursuing this with a Carefree attitude trying to figure out the mystery of AGI their mission statement says something like figure out AGI with curiosity and they're sharing their results it it may be that we can take them at face value maybe they don't care that much about building a business or are confident they'll have a better model soon and they can always not open source that one it's harder to understand how the Chinese government is understanding this did DPC C get sign off before they did an open source release like this has the Chinese government said that it's okay it does seem like the Chinese government is okay with the base model being not censored as long as the product that people actually use online is censored but again the people can download the base models maybe we should understand Chinese censorship as being less Draconian than we used to think maybe they want to control the Public Square but they don't really care what you think in the privacy of your own home when you're talking to your own language model running on your own laptop I've even seen analysis that maybe the Chinese government is just sleeping on this and and doesn't realize how important all this is that would be hard to believe if Western leaders have woken up to what's going on and we've seen $500 billion dollar Stargate projects announced in the last couple of days and full page ads saying no less than AI war in news print I don't think the Chinese government is missing that I think they are aware of what is going on they're aware that this is strategic are they playing a similar game where they're saying hey let's be the good guys let show that we're not a threat you know let's try to take the air out of the whole notion that this is some sort of AI arms race by just showing that we're comfortable with who we are and we can release our stuff we have the the national capacity to build these organizations that can perform at an elite level and and join the global Frontier but we're not trying to hoard all that benefit for oursel maybe they're playing a sort of de-escalatory strategy here I really don't know but I do want to understand that better so hopefully they'll be able to have a couple good conversations to illuminate that it's all this stuff was released in a friendly way that it seems to be a move toward deescalation if they had not open sourced their methods or their weights and said look at what we did and we're not going to tell you how that would definitely be a ratcheting up of the general sense of competition and tension at a minimum we can say that they did not do that what does this mean for policy I mean not too long ago definitely goes to show that we're all kind of upd dating often if you if you are not updating your worldview often your AI worldview often that is almost for sure a mistake and I feel like I may have over corrected a time or two but you want to be updating not too long ago I was like okay if I'm a compute governance person then this seems to reinvigorate me this being the reasoning Paradigm the idea that this is getting expensive again and the hardest problems a are going to have to think for a long time they're going to need huge resources well then maybe your average Rogue can't do some devastating Cyber attack or bio attack because they'll only have so much computing power whereas The Establishment will have far more they've said this about spam we got spammers spamming us but we have better more powerful systems we can control it maybe we could have a similar Dynamic that was my upshot from 01 this though you know again probably erodes that a bit we're now back to there's not that big of a difference between what you have to pay huge amounts of money for and what you have the ability to run on a pretty good home laptop is compute based governance going to really hold I don't know it doesn't seem like it's realistic they train this whole model on $6 Million worth of compute the base the Deep seek V3 it doesn't seem super realistic that we're going to be able to control compute well enough to prevent people from doing gain a function type research wherever they want to do it right can we get AIS to you know design some pathogen that you know kills certain cells with a certain uh rate that rate is a signal right you can get a you can get a objective reinforcement learning signal from as long as you can get over the hump and get any reward can you learn from that I don't see how we're going to control compute to the level that a huge number of research groups could do all kinds of gain of function research on AIS and I think that probably is coming should we try to prevent that should we try to stigmatize it should we create scary examples that show how it can go wrong and try to convince people that it's not something that they should do on their own maybe but it doesn't seem like we're going to be able to control the compute well enough to prevent that sort of thing from happening when it comes to China it's like what exactly are we trying to prevent them from doing it does not seem at this point like any of the measures that the United States has taken to restrict compute is preventing Chinese companies from being right there with our best companies at the frontier maybe in the future these things will start to be a greater constraint presumably they will but and $6 million is not a lot of compute and this if anything seems like less additional compute was spent on the reinforcement learning than it was spent on the original pre-training and it's just more easily parallelizable right you can go do your problem solving inference you you can spread that out and training is also becoming something that can be run on a decentralized basis but yeah what are we trying to prevent China from doing with AI right now they're doing everything we're doing being on the same Tech Tree still to me seems good the fact that they're sharing what they're doing in terms of General methods and the model weight itself seems very friendly don't we want AI to diffuse through the Chinese economy just like we want AI to diffuse through our economy so that everybody has a world of abundant expertise and you know potentially material abundance not too far from now as well I thought we all wanted that like I'm I'm just confused about what we think we're doing because it doesn't seem to be working now you could say oh we don't want them to develop military stuff or whatever framing it as an AI war and you know framing the resource of chips as the new oil and cutting them off from it doesn't seem like a good way to discourage them from militarizing their AI but I also just think they're going to have plenty of chips for their military they can make phones they can do this stuff on $6 million it does not seem like there's any realistic path to cutting off the chips so badly that they can't do the research or make the the military applications if they're determined to do that what we might end up doing is making it scarce enough that that's all they choose to do you could imagine a scenario where they can do their research and Military applications but they can't provide support to all the small businesses across the country I just don't see why we would want that in the first place I think there's plenty for Chinese small businesses and Chinese individuals to take advantage of AI without us needing to frame all this as a big rivalry I do think we're smart to build our own data centers I don't want to be beholden to China either we should build our own data centers we should build our domestic chip manufacturing capacity those things do make sense and it is going to take many billions to get there 500 billion probably isn't crazy given all the AI that people are going to want to run what are we trying to prevent China from doing they certainly seem to be doing an awful lot right now these are the best open source models in the world they have surpassed llama llama I'm sure and meta will have an answer but right now the best open- source models in the world have come from China the best research Publications at least explaining how these reasoning models are working have come from China so we're cutting them off from chips they are open- sourcing their research and models strange times something doesn't make a ton of sense there I guess one final caveat and people have noted this when you ask deep seek who trained you it does tend to say open AI I don't think I have an example of that up right now some people have said that just means they're training on open AI output I don't think that's the case I would would bet strongly against that the fact that open AI showed that something can work definitely inspires others to go in that direction and I wouldn't deny that being a factor the fact that it says that it was trained by open AI is more a reflection of background data contamination and being on the internet a lot they have not done nearly as much sanding down of the rough edges of their models as has been done by open Ai and anthropic in the west you see that in the dynamic right as well right this does not sound like corporate speak you can see the shog goth behind the the behavioral training so that's my best interpretation they don't even have access to 01 Chain of Thought Unless somehow it was stolen but that's not the vibe I get from this I think this is good research that has this weird Quirk of the model saying that it was trained by open AI because of other issues which are definitely reasonable there's a clear mechanism by which that could happen they just didn't clean that up and that's probably a to-do list item for them in the future or maybe they just don't care what we understand from Deep seek is to solve the mysteries of AGI maybe they don't care that it says that it was trained by open air the West still has a little lead cycle times are going down the lead is not super long in terms of time any strategy to get to a good AI future that depends on the west you know the good guys we having some insurmountable lead I don't think that's a great strategy anymore I never did think it was a great strategy but it it is predicated on the lead actually existing and that lead is pretty small I appreciate the Chinese companies for sharing what they have we're going to see a lot of weird stuff Downstream from this I hope to have a couple additional conversations to go deeper on the Strategic Dynamics and the policy but hopefully this was at least a good walkthrough of the actual research and the resulting models I do think that's really important to get grounded so go out last parting words use R1 go to chat. deep seek. com use it when the kimy reasoning model comes out use that too if you really want to be an Explorer and do Cutting Edge stuff that not too many people are going to do and where you have a chance to find something that matters we use r10 I think this is the first time that I've seen a model since the original G D4 early that I was able to test two and a half years ago this is the first model that has come out that I think merits the same level of drop everything and just immerse yourself in this model and really try to understand it both on R1 and R1 zero I am sure that there's a lot more to discover there and it's just dropped anybody listening to this if you've made it far into this podcast go do that I think you will learn and you will discover and and we will all be better off for it so that's it for now thank you all for being part of the cognitive Revolution it is both
