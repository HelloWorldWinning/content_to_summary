Title: 王立群：高官是跟出来的。 BV1mAcie6EdQ

Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Core Ideas:**

*   **High-Ranking Officials' Path:** High-ranking officials in this context are not appointed based on merit but are "followed" into their positions. Their rise to power is contingent on the success of their chosen superior.
*   **Zhao Gao's Strategy:** Zhao Gao needed to select one of Qin Huang's (Emperor Qin's) twenty-plus sons to support. He would then "follow" this son's rise, hoping to be promoted as his supported son gained power.
*   **Progression to Power:** Zhao Gao's ultimate goal was to transition from being a follower (进程) to a position of power in the palace (驻城) once his supported son achieved leadership.

**II. Core Point:**

Zhao Gao's path to power relied entirely on strategically aligning himself with a promising heir and benefiting from his rise.

**III. Fundamental Point:**

Political advancement is presented as less about personal capability and more about skillful association and riding the coattails of a powerful patron.

**IV. Overarching Framework:**

The content describes a hierarchical and patronage-based system of political advancement within the Qin dynasty, where personal connections and alliances are paramount to achieving high office, rather than merit or skill.
