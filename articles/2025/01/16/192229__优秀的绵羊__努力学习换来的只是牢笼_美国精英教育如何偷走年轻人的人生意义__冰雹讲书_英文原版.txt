**Summary:**

**I. The Problem with American Elite Education**

*   **A.  Flawed System:**
    *   Elite education is primarily a tool for social stratification, not enlightenment. It screens individuals who align with the upper class and trains compliant workers/consumers.
    *   It has evolved from a privilege for Anglo-Saxon aristocrats to a system that uses metrics (like SAT scores and extracurriculars) to maintain the status quo.
    *   It cultivates individuals who lack a sense of meaning, are afraid of failure, and are merely "high-level tools" in a system.
    * Modern education is rooted in the Industrial Revolution's need to create compliant workers.
*   **B.  Consequences:**
    *   Produces anxious, confused, and timid young elites, often described as "excellent sheep."
    *   These elites are overconfident, averse to risk, and lack genuine purpose.
    *   They blindly follow career paths (e.g., Wall Street) that are expected of them, regardless of personal interest.
    *   A high percentage of students suffer from depression due to the pressure and lack of self-direction.
    *   Parents often prioritize their own ambitions through their children, creating a conditional love dynamic.
    *   The system promotes a "rat race" mentality focused on status and competition.
    *   This system fails to address societal problems, is marked by the lack of courage and vision of elites.

**II.  Solutions and Alternative Perspectives**

*   **A.  Reframing the Purpose of Education:**
    *   Education should guide individuals toward a fulfilling life aligned with personal values, not just a job.
    *   True success lies in living authentically and pursuing one’s passions.
*   **B.  Leveraging Uniqueness:**
    *   Ordinary individuals can capitalize on their unique skills and backgrounds, often overlooked by elites.
    *   Exposure to niche skills and local knowledge can be a source of unique advantages.
    *   Examples: Housekeeping business using local networks; riding horses professionally (Inner Mongolia).
    *   Don't follow templates and use what is familiar.
*   **C.  Rejection of the "Rat Race":**
    *   The pursuit of status and constant comparison is ultimately unfulfilling.
    *   Focus on self-improvement and contributing to society with one’s own unique strengths.
    *   Failure is an experience, not an endpoint.
*   **D. Differentiated Value:**
    *   People should strive to be unique instead of being the best at something.
    *   When people are good at what they like, society will benefit from the results.

**III. Core Point:** The American elite education system, while appearing successful on the surface, produces a generation of confused individuals lacking purpose and direction.

**IV. Fundamental Point:** True fulfillment comes from pursuing a life aligned with one's authentic self and unique strengths, rather than chasing societal expectations and status.

**V. Overarching Framework:** The critique of a flawed, status quo-driven education system and a proposal for an authentic life in contrast with its limitations.

Content:
America’s elite education system is producing countless confused young people who are smart and talented but at the same time anxious, timid, confused, and painfully trapped in a bubble of privilege, meekly moving in the same direction without knowing why they are studying. They are very afraid of failure and have no sense of meaning in life. They look glamorous on the surface, but in fact they are just high-level tools. People are pushed into the prison of life. This is what the author William said in the book Excellent Sheep. Deresiewicz spent 24 years at an Ivy League school. He eventually resigned as a tenured professor. He believed that something was seriously wrong with elite education in the United States. This book caused a huge sensation in the United States when it was published in 2015. If you are familiar with education, Juan feels uncomfortable and confused about life This book is not to be missed. Today I will dismantle this book for everyone and talk about the true involution of American elite education and how to live the life you want. Abnormal American elite education. When it comes to education, many people think of enlightenment. Children's minds help them find the meaning of life, but that's not the purpose of education in the United States. So it is simply a tool for social stratification. Elite education is used to screen those who are in line with the interests of the upper class, while general education is used to discipline employees who obey orders and consumers who blindly follow the trend. This book deeply explores the history of elite education in the United States. Before the middle of the 20th century, elite education in the United States was not suitable for ordinary people. It was the privilege of Anglo-Saxon aristocrats to open up access to people and ethnic minorities. However, after World War II, the situation changed. The middle class grew and the American elite began to worry that they could not always block this upward path, and they must create a capability for ordinary people. It felt like they had a piece of the cake, so they invented the SAT. That is to say, the American college entrance examination and the college application model of writing personal statements appear to be selecting students with extremely strong overall qualities. In fact, they are screening those who share their values ​​​​and can protect their interests. Children who enter prestigious schools basically have some aristocrats. Characteristics: Play elegant musical instruments in a well-known concert hall, know some high-end sports such as fencing and equestrian, win national competition awards, serve as a student leader in a club, and have letters of recommendation from celebrities. In addition, the post-war United States emerged. For many large bureaucracies to get the machine running, they must train a team of highly skilled It has become a very safe way for meek and confused tool people to provide elite education to the middle class. In fact, modern education all over the world has more or less similar problems because modern education originated from Prussia during the Industrial Revolution. In order to achieve self-sufficiency, capitalists Farmers were brought to the city and trained to become diligent assembly line workers who could drive screws every day. They invented modern large-scale education, which is also called schools. To put it bluntly, modern schools are assembly lines that produce screws made of human flesh. A famous philosopher wrote a book It's called "Deschooling" Society: Deschooling Society" His criticism of education is even sharper. He said that the purpose of modern education is social control. The invisible curriculum of social control schools is actually instilling values ​​in the middle and lower classes of society that are in line with the interests of the elite in order to maintain the operation of capitalism and consumer society. So what kind of people are ultimately cultivated by elite education in the United States? Excellent The book "The Sheep" gives the answer to "A Bunch of Confused and Sophisticated Egoists. " This book says that American elite education is a disguise for social Darwinism. The purpose is to reproduce the symbols of privilege. These elites are unconnected, corrupt and incompetent. The financial crisis and social crisis in the United States in the past 30 to 40 years are the best proof that they are a group of management elites who are only loyal to their own ambitions. They have neither courage nor vision. This kind of America The shortcomings of education have not only brought about the failure of the social system, but also caused the inner conflicts and pain of generations of young people and the involution and confusion of the American elite. We always think that children in the United States enjoy a relaxed educational environment that emphasizes quality education and is full of creativity and diverse outlets, but in fact this is not the case. After more than 20 years of observation, the author of this book found that although the elites of Ivy League schools have been Being taught the American dream, oh baby, you can be anything when you grow up, but most top students end up going down the same path to financial firms on Wall Street. Companies and consulting companies have an annual salary of hundreds of thousands of dollars and work more than ten hours a day. Even if they don't like it in their hearts, they still have to maintain that glamorous life to meet the expectations of their parents and society. They don't know what they really want, or even if they know, they don't know what they really want. Dare to try. The professor said that these children are overconfident and cannot afford to lose at all. Because they have done so well since childhood, they have rich extracurricular activities in the decathlon. They are in the established They have received too much positive feedback on the track, and any deviation will make them feel extremely scared. Some students and professors admit that they actually don’t like Wall Street investment banks and would like to go to Africa to do charity or go back to their hometown to study in community schools, but they don’t dare because People around me go to Wall Street and earn hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. If they do what they like, it means they make less money than others, and they will be unable to hold their head high. What makes people confused is that whenever professors encourage their students to pursue the life they want instead of catering to the expectations of their parents and society, the elite students always say, "I don't have the cost of trial and error. " The professor asks, "Are you born in the top 100 income earners in the United States? " What is this about laziness in thinking in a few families? They have been accustomed to a certain life since they were young. They are always comparing themselves to others and do not dare to try and make mistakes. They do not dare to face any disadvantages in life. Certainty We often see in the media that middle-class parents in the United States say I just want my children to be happy, but in fact they have very high expectations for their children. Did you know that on average, one out of every ten college students in the United States is a depressed elite? The proportion is even higher in high school. The professor pointed out that many American parents, on the surface, say they are doing it for their children’s benefit, but in fact, they are doing it for their own benefit, turning their children into tools to realize their own will and using their children’s growth. Just to compensate for their fragile self, let children feel that their parents' love is conditional from an early age. Only by constantly gaining worldly achievements can they be loved. The professor criticized that the American education system has gone crazy. Elite schools and parents are not concerned about the true growth and development of their children. Instead of learning, they turned them into a machine for the reproduction of privileges and fell into a life-and-death competition. Have you ever heard of a popular word in English called Rat? Race Rat race describes this kind of competition. A group of rats huddle together to bite each other and snatch limited food. Can winning this competition really make us a human being? In the book "Don't Trust Your Intuition" we talked about before Data researchers from Google found that parents who provide the best growing environment for their children can only make their income as adults 26% higher than their parents', which means their status will improve. But it’s not enough to cross classes. In addition, if you read some economics books, you will find that it is almost impossible for the middle class to take power in the core areas of the United States. Those who really have the final say are just a few white families. You need to know The United States is already considered a country with relatively high mobility in the world. Will the situation in Asia be better? Asia is more particular about nepotism and it is difficult to get ahead. If you are interested in this topic, I suggest you read "Asian Godfathers" In the book "The Godfather of Asia", he tells how business tycoons in Asia made their fortunes. Many tycoons say that they are self-made. In fact, the story behind them is not that simple. Back to the book "Excellent Sheep", the professor warns young people not to fall into status comparison because it It's never ending. It's never going to satisfy you. It's impossible to get to the top. In the end, we'll all write in the book on the middle. Now that we've seen the lens of orbit, don't feel pessimistic. Instead, think about what we can do. We need to break the limitations of our thinking first. Understand what the point of going to college is Next, let’s talk about specific solutions. The significance of three universities is not just for a job. It should teach us how to live our own life according to our own wishes. The book writes that several of the professor’s students eventually gave up their careers on Wall Street. Even though the income is not as good as before, they see that they have really helped others and they are very happy and have found a sense of meaning in life. The professor believes that young people should find things they really like to do. No external rewards or results You can also spend several hours at a time immersed in it. After all, the ultimate test of life is not to judge our social status and material wealth, but to judge whether we have lived this life the way we want and whether we have the courage to be loyal to our inner choices. But how exactly do we do it? After all, the author of this book is a university professor of liberal arts. He has been in the ivory tower for decades and he cannot give specific solutions. So in the fourth part, I will add my opinions and give you specific operation methods and Case 4: The more ordinary people are, the more differentiated they are. The more common people deviate from the conventional track, the more they can take advantage of scarcity. Why do we need to look at the opportunity cost? For elites from prestigious schools, the opportunity cost of their departure from the track is higher than that of ordinary people. Think about it, giving up a job in a Wall Street investment bank means losing millions. The annual salary in RMB is not to mention that their ambitions are generally greater than ordinary people. If the money they earn from changing tracks is not higher than their original salary, they will not do it. Then the fields beyond their sight are opportunities for ordinary people. If you are more If you gain early exposure to skills in these fields, you will have great potential. Advantages For example, I met a girl at a rural activity some time ago. She graduated from a computer major in Zhejiang in 2019 and failed to take the postgraduate entrance examination. She had to stay at home and be confused. At this time, her aunt next door caught her attention. Then at this time I found out that my neighbor's aunt was very busy. She was busy every day. She was busy coming in and out every day. I seemed a bit bored and it was not that easy to find a job. Then I was very curious and told her that she was already over sixty. When I'm old, I say, aunt, you go in like this every day Is there so much work every day? She said it was impossible to finish it. From the conversation with her, I learned that her daily salary was three to five hundred. I was thinking that this means that this is a good market. There are people in their sixties who have such The salary is high and I, a college graduate, should have a bachelor’s degree. Graduates may find a job with a monthly salary of 4, 000 to 5, 000 yuan, which I think is about right. She has just started and she has such a high salary. I thought there must be a huge demand for housekeeping in the market. She suddenly had an idea and started taking orders and doing house cleaning in person. As business gets better and better, she misses her hometown There were so many aunts around who had little income. Could you help them? So she opened a housekeeping company. With her well-informed neighborhood relationships, she created the employment of more than 2, 000 aunts in Longyang District, Fuyang, Hangzhou, allowing each of them to earn more every year. Sixty thousand yuan Qian 's company's business is now very popular in Fuyang District, Hangzhou. You see, she has given full play to her unique local advantages. On the one hand, graduates from prestigious schools generally only focus on high-end industries. Will they think of doing housekeeping? On the one hand, even the big cities of Beijing and Shanghai Even the city's elites who came to us to start a business couldn't do it for her. She grew up in the countryside and has strong connections. She can speak dialects and the aunts only believe that there are advantages for foreigners from other places. So connections in small places are also a scarce resource. Let me give another example. There is a fan from Inner Mongolia He said that he just graduated from college, but he can ride horses and archery. His current job is to teach children to ride horses at the racecourse. The salary is not high, but it is very leisurely. He only has to work for one to two hours a day. You see, this is a scarce skill in the city. How many children can ride a horse? 985 / How many students from prestigious schools in 211 dare to ride horses and gallop on the prairie? But Inner Mongolians have more opportunities to come into contact with horses when they are young. So there are very few people who can ride horses nationwide. Doesn’t this make them stand out? So these are ordinary people. We need to use our brains more on the opportunities. Young people should not just think about applying for investment banking papers in big cities with students from prestigious schools. Don’t take them to apply for investment banking papers in big factories. You have to impose a template on yourself. You have to start from your unique advantages and use the familiar skills and resources in the environment where you grew up. They are all treasures. What is taught in school is explicit knowledge that anyone can obtain. This is just the tip of the iceberg. And these skills and information you have accumulated since childhood are tacit knowledge, which is your differentiated treasure. I think we must put it aside. Get rid of the single competitive thinking of the tortoise and the hare. Have you ever thought about why the good tortoise sweats profusely and competes with the hare to see who can run faster? If the tortoise just lies motionless and wins if you live longer, isn’t it a waste if you don’t use your good talents? In real nature, rabbits don’t race with tortoises. They each have their own strengths and roles in their respective ecological niches. Prosperity If the world is the same, then the world economy will be lifeless and gloomy. It is precisely because everyone can use their own strengths that the world is vibrant because of diversity, and human society will continue to progress. So, dear friends, don’t deviate from one thing. I feel scared when I click on the track. On the contrary, the value of people in society lies in differentiation. You don't have to be best, but you have to be the only. When you do something you are good at and like, you are more likely to do it to the best. When you do it to the best Others will benefit from your skills, and the entire society will benefit from your existence. Besides, there is no such thing as failure in life. It is just an experience. Live this life the way you want to gain what you want. Isn't this the greatest success? Everyone pursues their own happiness, not just their own happiness. My realization is also of social significance. When each of us can live in our own way, we can build a more diverse, inclusive and innovative society. I really like the ending sentence of Excellent Sheep and share it with everyone. Thank you for watching this. In this video, I am Xia Binghai, who loves to read original English books. See you in the next issue.
