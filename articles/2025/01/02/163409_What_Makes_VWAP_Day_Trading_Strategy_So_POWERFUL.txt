Description:
Okay, here's a concise, outlined summary focusing on the core ideas:

**Summary:**

*   **VWAP is a Lagging Indicator:**
    *   VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) is a lagging indicator, not favored by the speaker who prefers price action and support/resistance trading.
    *   It's volume-weighted, used for lower timeframes; unsuitable for swing trading (4-hour charts).
*   **Common VWAP Usage:**
    *   Typically, traders remove upper and lower bands and treat the VWAP line as support/resistance, but price often goes straight through it.
*   **Speaker's Alternative VWAP Strategy:**
    *   Keep upper/lower bands; view VWAP as a "magnet," not support/resistance.
    *   On lower timeframes, when price breaks out of the upper band with a bearish candle, short the trade down to the VWAP.
    *   Similarly, if the price comes out of the lower band with a bullish candle, you can take a long through the VWAP.
*   **Risk Management:**
    *   The speaker uses support and resistance, emphasizing the use of consistent stop-loss orders (e.g., 1% of account) and achievable take-profit levels to maintain positive risk-reward.
    *   He advises against dollar-cost averaging.
*   **Importance of Strategy:**
    *   Profitability comes from a solid strategy, risk management, and a proper approach to the market, not from specific indicators.
    *   Successful trading is about making more on wins than losses, leading to net profits over time.

**Core Point (Conclusion in one sentence):**
The VWAP indicator can be used differently by viewing it as a magnet on lower timeframes and combined with price action, however, a consistent risk management strategy is the most important element for success.

**Fundamental Point (Conclusion in one sentence):**
Trading success depends on a solid strategy, proper risk management (stop-losses), and achievable take-profits, not solely on any specific indicator.

BWB volum weighted average price is this something that you would trade with is it something that I would trade with well in all honesty I don't trade with it as you know I don't trade with any indicators we use support and resistance use price action to trade but today I'm going to show you how to use the vwap system simply because someone requested it and I'm doing a little series on other indicators so that you can figure out how other people trade and if you need to trade with some something like this you might want to use it in conjunction with the trading that you're doing these systems all work but this is just another lagging indicator which in my opinion is not the best but a lot of people swear by it a lot of people live by it and basically it's a moving average indicator that is divided by the volume it works in the volume into the whole pricing you can't really use this as a swing Trader and a 4-Hour Trader like we use it it's more for lower time frames because you you'll see why I'm going to show you now why that is I'm going to take my ugly muck out of the way and we're going to go and have a look at the charts and then we can go and see for ourselves what we're looking at here today let me just move it over to the side here so that it's completely out of the way and we'll have a look at the charts now I'm not going to do a lot of editing on this video so please excuse the quality of the picture but uh I am going to do my best to show you how the vwap works so let me take you and show you how the vwap works and then we'll we'll take it from there and then I'll talk to you about our strategy our strategy in the market and how we trade in the market with regards to actually making money because these squiggly lines as I've told you a million times they don't make you the money you and I both know that the money is made with a strategy and the way you approach the market at the end of the day because I don't think you really believe that you can make money off a squiggly line if you go on a course they're going to tell you that I mean there's a lot of people that will advertise this vwap for you to you and say oh make 120% profit on it make 100% profit ah this will make you Pro no the squiggly Line's not going to make you profit your approach to how you trade it that's what's going to make you the profit at the end of the day you and I both know that anyway let's get to it let's have a look for the indicator so the indicator is called the vwap so let's let's stick that in volume weighted average price there we go pretty sure that's in now let me see if I'll be able to adjust it firstly hopefully let's see what settings have we got here no these are not the settings I'm looking for of course they're not the settings I'm looking for the settings I'm looking for are these settings here now what most people will tell you is to take the upper band and the lower band out and then you just trade with the middle line the vwap I'm not going to do that I'm actually going to make the middle line a Little Bit Stronger and I'm going to leave the upper band and the lower band in going against General consensus because the general consensus is now here's the reason you can't swing trade with VW simply because the bars just go through the line there's just no way you can use a 4H hour to trade this so let's look at the 15 minute and I'll and I'll show you how the guys trade it on the 15 minute so that you can get a good idea of what exactly is going on here now that makes it a little bit more clear doesn't it that gives you a bit of a clearer picture so this thick blue line in the middle that's your volume weighted average price now the outer and lower line is just very much a bit like a Ballinger band it's just an outer and a lower level right what what do they show it as they show it as upper band one and lower band one it's part of the calculation now most of the guys will tell you to take that out and most of the guys will tell you that you must as when it gets to this vwap you should use it as a support and trade out or when it gets to this vwap you should use it as a resistance and trade down and I get that or wait for it to retest and then go and then trade up but what I noticed about the vwap was this most of the time the price just goes through it just keeps on going through it so how do you trade it in a situation where every time the price gets to it it just goes through it I mean it's pretty insane to think about it but you know some of the guys will say to you if the price is on top of the V weap you only go long and if the price is below the V weap you only go short but me being a support and resistance price action Trader a person who doesn't use indicators I looked at this and thought no do you know what I don't think that's the way to trade it so I'm going to show you the way that I would trade this and the way that I would use it based on the way that we trade based on the methods that we use to trade in the market because I don't believe that the the standard way of using this volume weighted average price will work I don't believe it can can work for you in any way shape or form uh whether you're trading 15 minutes 5 minutes 4 hours whatever the case what I'm showing you here is on a 15 minute we could show you on a 5 minute as well but it works better on the lower time frames I have to say it doesn't work on on the higher time frames whatsoever I'm now going to show you what I think and the way I think now this Euro US dollar firstly we've determined uh let's see okay let's go to the higher time frame let's go to the day and have a look at it and see what we've got and what we've got we've got a bearish structure the EUR US dollar is going down so we know that your EUR US dollar is bearish now we go back to that was it 15 minute chart the seconds here 15 minute chart and we're going and have a look there all right so now you've got we know that it's bearish and now we've got a situation where we've got the volume weighted average price in we've got the upper band and we've got the lower band now while everybody else has told you to take the upper band and the lower band out I'm telling you to leave it in and here's why guys because what I believe for the volume weight today average price and I believe the way we should trade it is this if you're going to use it on these lower time frames look at it as a magnet not as a support and resistance as everybody tells you to look at it like a magnet and what I say is okay the Euro US dollar is bearish now if you understand anything about price action you're looking at this and thinking hm there might be some money lying up here there might be some money lying up here so there might be some money to be taken in this general area now hear me out here this is a magnet it keeps coming back and going through look how many times it goes through this vwap all the time it just keeps on going through it up and down up and down up and down time it gets there it comes down it comes down it goes up without fail actually it keeps going through this thing what I'm looking at is okay at this area here it's broken through the upper band and I would say if you get a red candle developing out of this upper band starting to come down take the short we know it's bearish take the short right down and till it gets to the magnet now if you think it's going to be a support and it's going to bounce out of that area then fine sell it or you can use our general consensus where we follow the stop loss down and and we just put the stop loss behind it and follow it down behind the price whatever the case I would kind of use the vwap for sculping if that's what you want to do and what I would do is I would say fantastic that's a magnet that's a short I'll take the short here with a view to it coming back down and going back through this this volume weighted average price as it keeps on doing and then I wouldn't actually take the long I'd let it go back up again and if it comes short again I'll wait for it to come short again and go back through obviously I'll just wait for a bit of sign of weakness maybe a red candle developing and take the the trade down into the vwap now that's how I would trade the vwap and in fact I would trade it that way on absolutely any one of these products for example the us500 we know it's bullish we know that this has come through the vwap so what you're looking for here is it's on the lower it's gone through the lower band it's it's retracing it's coming back down now you and I both know in price action terms that on a on a 15minute chart this is there'll be some money here at the 59.86 so if this gets down this far and then gives us a green candle you can effectively say to yourself I'm going to take the long trade out of here through to the vwap and I'm going to take it through there and make a profit and then get out that's a bit of a sculp look there's no necessity to trade this way I mean if you want to trade on the lower time frames is very risky we all know that trading is super super risky in fact 60 to 80% of Traders lose money swing trading and on the lower time frames like we're playing around with here on a 15 minute or 5 minute chart 99% of Traders lose money but this particular indicator might actually give you a bit of an advantage it might actually give you that that insight as to okay I've seen the price action because now you understand price action cuz we trade price action and now you can also see the the the possibility of it going back through the vwap so I'm quite happy to to actually trade it that way so you know the way I look at it guys is at the end of the day the way we trade is not the way of the vwap of the macd of the moving average or anything like that you and I both know that we trade with support and resistance and the reason we do that is because the Market's a 50/50 game it can go up or it can go down we both know that we've discussed it over and over again and why it's because the Market's made up of buyers and the Market's made up of sellers so there's no guarantee of which way the trade's going to go if you take it anyway but what we are looking at is a strategy so that you don't lose the money so the best way to trade is actually the normal support and resistance and with a proper stop loss and with a proper take profit so what you're looking at is you want to make more on your wins and lose Less on your losses and how do you do that the old story 1% of your account so if your account's $100,000 you risk $1,000 on every single trade the same amount and if you don't want to risk 1% risk 2% risk half a percent whatever the size of your account just keep the risk the same on every single trade and if you do that and you look at your take profit and as long as it's a make your take profit a reasonable take profit don't say oh it has to be 2:1 so I'm going to put a 2:1 take profit in here when you know there's no chance in hell that you're ever going to get that profit there's no point in that either so if you're going to have a take profit at least make it a take profit that you might achieve that you might actually be able to achieve if you wanted to actually take the profit so now you've got your ,000 stoploss you go into the trade you look at how much it's going to how much of a trade size that's going to be so you work it back from your invalidation area that's an area that if I looked at the trade I would not trade there I would not get into that trade ever right that's it that trade that no that's your stop loss you put your stop loss in there you work back and you say Okay $1,000 will give me that size of a trade that's the size of the trade you're going to take and I want to make more on my win than I would on my loss so I want to make $2,000 on my win so will that work out will that risk to reward work out will I be able to make that $2,000 if I take this trade at least 1,500 you know you got to have more than than wins than losses and the reason behind that is you're going to lose five trades and you're going to win win five trades and on the five trades that you lose if you lose $11,000 and on the five trades you win you win $2,000 the net win is a $5,000 profit at the end of those 10 trades and that's the point of your trading really it's not rocket science it's quite simple and it's the simplest business plan in the world and I always emphasize do not dollar cost average while you're here drop down don't forget get your free Forex book it's down there in the description and there's also a funded Trader account if you're into that sort of thing so so guys that's how we trade fundamentally we trade with a standard stop loss making it so much easier and so much less hassle so if I take you here and I say let's get rid of the vwap okay remove for drawings uh remove one indicator so now there's your us500 we don't trade on the 15 minute we trade on the 4H hour we go to the day we're just going to have a look on the day we're going to see what we've got here so what's happened on the day chart is we've had this bounce what I would call most likely a deadcat bounce you got to remember this trading is on extremely low volume and on the day that I'm looking at this it's almost a public holiday so why would anyone want to trade today now what we do is we take it to a line chart when you're on a line chart you look for a resistance there's your resistance you take your resistance you draw it in you look for a support where's a support and the reason we use the line charts guys reason we use a line charts is because it's closing prices not highs and lows and we're looking for an area where the price gets two goes away gets two goes away it's an area that it likes there's an area that gets two goes away area gets two goes away an area that it likes there a resistance and a support because that's where money is lying that's where orders are lying and that's why it keeps bouncing away from there put it back on the candles and then we go and trade on the 4 Hour because that's where we trade we're swing Traders now we're not using vwap we're using our standard our little copy okay A little idea as to where we're going now we know that us500 is bullish in General it is heading to the upside next year it's probably going to go pretty far into the moon a lot of people will call for a crash but I doubt that I doubt that's going to happen I see there's going to be a lot of positive moves next year best case scenario this thing does another retracement back to the 58s or 57s it might even go back to 57 cuz there is some money down here and then we get a long run going through into the year taking us higher than our high which was at 61 so support and resistance you take it from the day chart draw it in easy easy take your trades manage your risk and that will be your best trading how can I put it your best trade let's say your best trade so guys thanks for watching that this is a pretty simple video today I haven't made it complicated and I haven't made it as fun as I usually do but I've done the best for you it's a holiday week I've been on holiday most of this week been kind of an easier week but everybody needs a break don't we we're going into the new year and we're going to have an exciting year together we're going to make loads of money together looking looking forward to it thanks for watching this don't forget to watch the last videos if you want to know more about our trading strategy and how we make money in the markets cheers guys till the next video thanks and bye
