Description:
**Core Ideas:**

1.  **Tool Introduction:** Storm (STM), an open-source AI research assistant from Stanford, can generate articles, blog posts, and research papers. It is free to use or can be self-hosted.
2.  **Functionality:** Storm uses a multi-step process:
    *   Identifies research perspectives.
    *   Collects content from the internet (e.g., using Bing).
    *   Organizes information and creates an outline.
    *   Writes the article, including references.
3.  **Persona-Based Approach:** Storm uses personas (e.g., basic fact writer, microbiologist) to guide its content creation process, simulating a multi-perspective discussion.
4.  **Pre-Writing & Writing Phases:** Storm follows a pre-writing phase focused on outline generation and a writing phase focused on producing the final article.
5.  **Possible Application:** Besides research, the tool's approach could be used for market research, emulating focus group style discussions with different personas, and generating reports.

**Core Point:**

Storm is a powerful, open-source AI research assistant tool that uses a unique multi-perspective approach to generate well-structured articles and research papers.

**Fundamental Point:**

This tool demonstrates a novel approach of using AI to emulate human-like research methodologies, making advanced research and information synthesis accessible.

this is the only AI research assistant tool that you would need this is an open source project that you can also self host and in this video I'm going to tell you how you can use this tool to create research articles blog post even something like a small mini research paper and also we're going to dive into a bit of technical detail about how this research assistant or the tool actually works the tool name is called storm STM it's from Stanford it's a research project at this point but they've also hosted it for free which you can go try out and then write your research articles so this is based on this paper so the tool the way it looks like is this I asked the tool to create an article in the title of Transformers versus RNN in the context of LMS for those who are not familiar with deep learning Transformers an architecture which has been quite widely used in large language models let's say like um gp4 gpt3 gpt2 gpt1 and RNN which stands for recurrent neural network was quite something that was quite popular before Transformers to go over the place so I just wanted to create an article so this is what storm has created so there is a summary and there's a background and within background you have got subtopics so you can see the table of content here so youve got Title Here summary background comparison of Transformers and RNN impact on large language models challenges and limitations it's a very Wikipedia style article or you can say a research paper style article and it uh not just gives you like content just you know typically if you want something like this you can go to chat gbd and ask but what it does particularly good which not a lot of other tools do is it also gives you the reference so you can go see the reference here and I mean Google if you have used Google deep research it kind of does something like this but this tool is absolutely free you don't have to pay for it I mean right now you can use it for free because trying to they're trying to collect your respons and use it for research but later on if you want to self host it they've given the GitHub complete repo and then you can start using it so first of all I'm going to just kick off a demo and with that demo I'm going to show you how to use the tool and then we're going to look into the research part about how the tool is being built and what kind of things contribute to the tool so first of all let's go so this is the interface you've got two options one is Storm the second one is co storm storm is like a single uh perspective um you have got like an article and coor is like a round table conversation very similar like what notebook Elm does whenever you give a particular topic so I'm going to go ahead with storm I don't want like a round table conversation and you can go here and ask any article type you want like a scientific question like a historic question in fact you can go to the Discover section and see what kind of questions people have been asking I mean you see wide range of topics like perception of cyber security and e-commerce recent studies in the system of fesia system and lot of other things like rise of electric vehicles so I'm going to go ahead and then ask okay once simple question why is uh let's say antibiotic um resistance um a big threat to humanity nothing to do with anything I'm researching nothing to do with this channel just went ahead and then gave a topic so why is antibiotic resistance a big threat to humanity so first of all as you can see here first identifying different perspectives for a research topic that's its first step it has got four steps second it started looking at for content on internet and uh meanwhile it is asking you what is your writing purpose so I can say this is going to and you can see that it is starting to finish browsing all these things I'm going to just give something please provide okay this is going to be uh research paper Okay so it has finished browsing the internet so it's collected all the links I think it's using Bing at this point it has taken everything and it's getting all the links uh the research papers mostly like Trust uh articles but you can see like for different topic it goes to different information as well so now it started organizing the information and creating an outline and once it creates an outline I think that is exactly where the workflow differs from a lot of other tools then it is going to write the article so it's going to first create the outline then write the article and what you can also do is you can go see the brainstorming process so right now for this particular case they've created four personas one is a basic fact writer and the role of the basic fact writer is basic fact writer focuses focusing on broadly covering the basic facts about the topic veterinarian why veterinarian there is an animal okay a specialist in Animal Health who is well versed in the use of antibiotics in livestock it's contribution to antimicrobial resistance okay from a veterinarian perspective a microbiologist perspective a public health official perspective these are the four different personas it has created for us to create the final a so the basically what this the way storm works is it's a it's a they ask back and forth question to these kind of people and then collect the article so you can see here so there's a question the bot is asking then the person is answering then there's a question that the person is answering and this is exactly what is happening here and finally we have got the article here the topic summary background causes of antibiotic resistance impact on health Global Perspective Public Health policies Solutions and strategies I'm me just like simply go see global initiatives okay it shows wh has this and um national action plans local and Regional initiatives it's a very to be honest like it's a very very very well- written article I'm not trying to say that you should use this for high school essays or university essays but it's a very well- written article I can't possibly write something like this in such a short span of time like 4 minutes or 5 minutes right now it's free um but you can sell for host it how do you self host it there is this repo that you can go use it there is storm and if you go see storm uh one of the thing that would quite evidently look um is you can see Omar katab who is also actively involved in developing uh dpy so if you go to requirements.txt you would um you would naturally see dpy as the first Library so they are the code base is heavily dspi based code base but also if you go to knowledge storm and if you go to storm Wiki and if you go to engine one of thing that you can see is like how these kind of different llms are used and if you go to modules now you would start seeing the different the main sections of how storm is used uh you have got a Persona generator like the one that we saw four personas were there then you have got the outline generation then you have got the article generation you've got knowledge curation jumping directly into the paper so if you go the way storm works is they have got two main sections one is what they call as pre-writing the second one is what they call as writing and uh they said they ins they got inspired from how high school or university teachers would guide their students so they're not going to help the students exactly write the essay but they would play a tremendous role in designing the outline and that is what they're doing so in the pre-writing stage they're going to ask different questions and create the outline and then they're also going to use the llm and the research content and everything to finally write the full length article so there are like three things direct prompting so there going to be different questions asked then there's a perspective guided question and asking this is where the personas matter and then there is this conversational question and asking so you go to for example in this case a microbiologist ask a question come back so you can see here in my case this case uh there is an academic researcher there's a question asked on academic researcher what they answer get back what they do so this is very similar like what market research companies with focus groups very similar approach in this particular case I believe I strongly believe uh this kind of paper could be uh definitely adapted into something like a market research AI agent project so somebody's building a startup you should probably use this approach there but it's a very interesting approach um pre-writing and then writing I'm going to finally show one more example but otherwise this is a very solid tool so let's go to a new session and I'm going to just ask something that is quite relevant at this point so why is uh Jan 1st celebrated celebrated as New Year even though Jesus was born on Christmas December 25 is Christmas 24 I guess 24th so I'm sorry if I'm making a mistake so okay I shouldn't have any brackets cool start the research so something that is relevant what's the purpose uh just for my knowledge okay and oh just for my knowledge to write a post so it's starting to browse the internet at this point as you can see here um so step two is to start browsing the internet and you if you go there you would see like a lot of libraries helping it to do that so it's getting different articles like getting from Wikipedia there is like some history related information about New Year from britanica which is an encyclopedia Mental Floss a Blog that I used to read quite a while back some uh Christianity related articles um so it's collecting all the information about the question that we have asked so the very first thing that you might have noticed that it knows that what is a topic that we have asked so what where it should go look for things I think that is the first most important information because you collect all this information now after getting everything it is going to create the outline so it's starting writing and drafting the article that is the final step outline has been done now it is writing the actual article in there so because this is not like a very strong research project you can see the table of content is not as big as like the other items that we got summary historical information cultural perspective theological consideration historical events and figures so you can see the brainstorming process uh we have got a basic fact writer historical scholar religious historian a cultural Anthropologist that's a very interesting choice to be honest um the okay the question is can you explain the historical origin okay fine uh historical factors contributed to the selection of December 25 as a date for celebrating Christmas how does it relate to the timing of New Year celebration okay then different cultures very interesting perspective to be honest now if you see all these things so you can finally go see the historical events and figures what kind of things happened so you have got uh Pope Pope Gregory um 13 probably so if you know the history of New Year you know that uh the calendar that we follow in the world predominantly is called a Gregorian calendar it's it's a it's a solar based on sun not a lunar calendar as far as I know I think um Romans were using a Luna calendar like a Julian calendar or something like that so you can see that okay Gregorian calendar is what has ideally uh been established and that is basically the fundamental of why January 1st and you can see here so his work position the birth of Christ as year one further embedding the Christian narrative within the framework of the calendar so it does a pretty good job it is not hallucinating in this particular case it does a pretty good job of explaining what it wants to explain and I'm not I'm not talking about this particular article in this particular case but you can see that it has done a pretty good job if you want to use it for publishing articles papers it's I don't consider this to be a slop it's not like a crappy work uh I would say this is a high quality um um NN work who would do research and then give you something which would not be like easily possible if you are like a single person or like the rearch assistant or the intern is like a completely dumb person pretty good um I'm looking forward to explore more into storm but I would say that this is a very very solid research assistant probably the only one that you would need if you don't want to spend a lot of money and if you want to sell Force if you want to like run it as a product and like I said like this could be extremely useful in a market research situation imagine like you want to launch a shampoo like I don't know how many of you have ever worked with fmcg companies but if you have ever worked with fmcg companies before they launch any product they would go to a market research company and they would say that oh we want to launch a shampoo like do you know what is something that people look for in shampoo the market research company would create like a focus group send a survey to a bunch of people and then they would get the perspectives now what you can probably try to do is you can have like a mid middle-aged let's say housewife woman you have got like a college student um you have got like a mother and you have got like different personas and then make them talk to each other then finally create a research report that would say that what is that people look into in a shampoo when they buy why would retention happens and you can sell the report uh this is a very successful business model uh per se so if you are trying to build something like this let me know I would love to know more about it but for now storm is the only tool that you probably need let me know if you like the tool what do you feel about it if you have used anything else like Google deep research but otherwise thanks to the Stanford researchers for putting this tool all together and also making it open source for us to read the code base see you in another video Happy prompting
