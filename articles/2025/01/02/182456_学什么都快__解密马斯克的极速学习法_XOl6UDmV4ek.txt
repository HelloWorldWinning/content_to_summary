**核心观点总结：**

1.  **大学教育的价值被高估：** 大学并非学习的必要途径，其主要价值在于证明个人能坚持完成任务，而非知识本身。
2.  **学习应以问题为导向：** 学习不应从工具入手，而应从实际问题出发，例如，先了解引擎工作原理，再去学习所需工具。
3.  **第一性原理：** 深入分析事物本质，从最基础的层面重新思考问题，而非照搬现有模式或经验，并将其应用于解决问题。
4.  **数据思维：** 预测未来是衡量智慧的重要标准，通过批判性思考过去，不断修正错误，从而提高预测能力，并运用概率思维。

**核心结论 (一句话):** 马斯克认为，学习的本质是解决问题，而非单纯的知识积累； 应该以第一性原理和数据思维为指导，从而更有效，更有创造性的进行学习。

**根本结论 (一句话):**  应打破传统学习和教育的束缚，通过问题导向、第一性原理和数据思维，主动掌握知识并解决现实难题，实现高效学习和创新。

今天咱们来聊一个特别的话题埃隆马斯克是怎么看待学习和教育的说实话他的这些观点可能会彻底改变我们对学习的认知大家想想马斯克在他40多岁就创立了4家市值超过数十亿的公司而且每一家都深耕不同的领域从软件到新能源从电动车到航天工业确实令人惊探很多人都在试图解读马斯克的成功密码有人说是他超强的工作态度每周工作84个小时也有人说是他惊人的意志力但是秦奋并不是马斯克的专利干事业的人谁不是在拼命工作那么问题来了为什么偏偏是马斯克能取得这么与众不同的成就呢在解读他的第一性原理之前我们先来听听他对大学教育的看法The value of a college education is somewhat overweightedYou know, and I think it's too too many people actually spend four years accumulating a ton of debtand then often don't have useful skills that they can apply afterwardsand I think I have a lot of respect for people who work with their handsand we need electricians and plumbers and copentersand you know, that's a lot more important than having incremental political science majorsI thinkYou know, soI think we should not have this idea thatthat to be successful you need to have a four-year collegethat is simply not sureYou don't need college to learn it learn stuffOkaybut everything is available basically for freeYou can learn anything you want for freeIt is not a question of learningThere is a value that colleges havewhich is likeyou know, seeing whether somebody'sIt can somebody work hard at somethingincluding a bunch of sort of annoying homework assignmentsand still do their homework assignmentsand I kind of soldier through and get it doneyou know, that'sThat's like the main value of college So I think colleges are basically for funand to prove you can do your choresbut they're not for learning A university education is often unnecessary That's not to say it's unnecessary for peoplebutI thinkYou probably learn about as muchbut the vast majority what you're going to learn there in the first two yearsand most of it is for your classmates Now for a lot of companies they do want to see the completion of the degree because they're looking for someone who's going to persevere and see it through to the end and that's actually what's important to them So it really depends on what somebody's goal is If a goal is to start a company I would say no point in finishing college So I think that's how it should be and it shouldn't be that you've got like these grades where people move in lockstep and so everyone goes through you know, it goes like normally you know, we'll go through English math Science and so forth from like fifth grade to sixth grade to seventh grade like it's an assembly line but people are not objects on an assembly line that's a ridiculous and I think unfortunately like a lot of education is very bored billion you've got you know, someone standing out there kind of lecturing at people and they've done the same lecture 20 years in a row and they're very excited about it and that like enthusiasm you know, it's conveyed to the students that they're not very excited about it they're not why they're there like why are we learning this stuff we don't even know why In fact, I think a lot of things people learn probably there's no point in learning them because they never use them in the future you generally you want education to be like as close to a video game as possible like a good video game like you do not need to tell your kid to play video games they will play video games on autopilot all day so if you can make it interactive and engaging then you can make education far more compelling and far easier to do so you really want to disconnect the whole grade level three from the subjects allow people to progress at the fastest pace they can So how would you educate your five boys? Actually, I created a little school yeah What kind of school could you describe to us? Sure, it's, I mean, it's small it's only got 14 kids now and it'll have 20 kids in September it's called ad astra which means to the stars that's maybe a bit different from from most other schools is that there aren't any grades there's no like not grade one grade two grade three type of thing and making all the children go and in the same grade at the same time like an assembly line I know you know because some people love English or languages some people love math some people love music and different abilities different times it makes more sense to cater the education to match their aptitudes and abilities it's like that's one principle another is that it's important to teach teach problem solving or teach to the problem not to the tools so this would be like let's say you're trying to teach people about how engines work or you know you could start by to more traditional approach would be to say we're going to teach you all about screwdrivers and ranchers and and you even have a course on screwdrivers a course on wrenches and all these things and it's there's a very difficult way to do it a much better way would be like here's the engine now let's take it apart how we're going to take it apart oh you need a screwdriver that's what the screwdriver is for you need a wrench that's what the wrench is for and then a very important thing happens which is that the relevance of the tools because I see this will be going pretty well I mean the kids really love going to school I think that's a good sign you know I mean I hated going to school when I was a king that was torture in the interview Ma Si Ke mentioned the real problem of learning and not the ability to learn the tools actually it's been in the first place in the first place the main thing is no matter what you do you have to start from the point of view I do think there's a good framework for thinking it is physics you know the sort of first principles reasoning but what I mean by that is boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there as opposed to reasoning by analogy through most of our life we get through life by reasoning by analogy which essentially means kind of coughing what other people do with slight variations and you have to do that otherwise it's mentally you wouldn't be able to get through the day but when you want to do something new you have to apply the physics approach give me an example of that like what's one thing that you've done that on that you feel is work for you sure so um somebody could say um in fact people do that battery packs are really expensive and that's just the way they'll always be because that's the way they've been in the past you know like well no that's that's pretty dumb and you say no okay what what what what what are the batteries made of so the first principle we say okay what are the material constituents of the batteries what does the spot market value of the material constituents so you can say okay it's got covalent nickel aluminum carbon um and some polymers for separation and steel can so break that down in our on a material basis and say okay if we both add an aluminum metal exchange what would each of those things cross like oh geez it's like $80 per kilowatt hour so clearly you just need to think of clever ways to take those materials and combine them into the shape of a battery cell and you can have batteries that are much much cheaper than anyone realized关于马斯克提到的第一性原理特斯拉的电动车和SpaceX的火箭制造就是最好的力证当时所有人都认为电动车和火箭的制造成本高的离谱根本不可能商业化但马斯克没有被这些既定任之束缚他把产品拆解到最基础的原材料层面电池究竟用了哪些金属原料火箭的零部件最根本的材料是什么通过这种方式他发现实际的制造成本可能只有传统认知中的一小部分正是这种追本素原的四位方式让特斯拉和SpaceX成功地把天价产品变成了可以商业化的现实方案这就是第一性原理四位的威力不被现有认知限制而是从最基本的层面重新思考问题那么这对我们普通人的工作生活有什么起发呢让我们用英语学习这个每个人都熟悉的例子来说明英语的本质说到底不过是一个用来进行国际交流或许信息的工具根据第一性原理我们需要做的就是把英语学习融入到自己的日常工作生活中去用到哪里学到哪里而不是一本一本肯英语字点应著头皮被单磁就像没人会为了学习一把螺丝刀而去死际它的重量材质和型号一样工具就是用起来才有意义比如说喜欢看电影的可以看英文原版对科技感兴趣的可以直接阅读英文技术文档做设计的可以去看国外的设计案例这样一来英语就不再是刻本离死机应备的知识而是解决实际问题的工具我们不是在学习英语而是在用英语学习这就是运用第一性原理带来的转变从最基本的需求出发找到最直接的解决方案最后我们再来聊聊马斯克一个特别的思维方式装家数据思维有人说马斯克赌性十足从440亿美金收购推特到压上全部身家知识川普他这每一次都是一次好赌但是他都赌赢了截止目前推特已经成为全球最受欢迎的社交媒体而美国大选的结果我们已经看到了而关于美国大选神奇的是马斯克在结果出来四个小时前就知道了最终的结果周柔根在他的节目当中也对此事做了披露Elon created an app跟他说他赶快追踪没多难所以那么他 everyone他还跟董事业更争阿根说奥荫leyon我还知道他的审讯物力但他 had最喜欢的纸膊据消息但是刚等等esta但 yet Trump was ahead in these statesCombles never gonna win those states所以 tabulated thatand put it all togetherI don't know how he did itDena, I don't even talk to Elon about thisI don't know the Dana translationBut Dana said he had an appand he was like showing them He was like a tofu那么马斯克的装家数据思维到底是怎么一回事法律的right metric for intelligenceis the ability to predict the futureYou're as intelligent as you can predict the future wellbecause if somebody claimsthis person or this AI is very intelligentlike, well, how good are his predictionsand if its predictions are not very goodit's not that smart to predict the futureyou have to think critically about the pastand constantly try to be less wrongand just in general, critical thinking is goodyou know, examining whether you have the correct axioms or the most applicable axioms does the logic necessarily connectand then what are the range of probable outcomesactual outcomes are usually not deterministicthey're a rangeand so you want to figure out what those probabilities areand make sure, ideally, that you are the house let's find a gamble as long as you are the house
