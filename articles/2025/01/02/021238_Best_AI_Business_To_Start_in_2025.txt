Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Two Paths for AI Business in 2025:**
    *   **No-Code:** Easier to learn (3-6 months), focuses on AI automation, niche services, and freelance work.
    *   **Code:** Longer learning curve (1-2 years), enables creation of web apps, mobile apps, and software pipelines (APIs).

2.  **No-Code Deliverables:**
    *   AI automation agency, providing services to businesses.
    *   Niche services, like AI-enhanced photo editing.
    *   Primarily freelance, client-based workflows.

3.  **Code Deliverables:**
    *   Web applications.
    *   Mobile applications.
    *   Software pipelines/APIs sold as endpoints.

4.  **Time Considerations:**
    *   **No-Code:** Requires a calculation of client load vs. desired income. More time intensive unless you raise prices or hire.
    *   **Code:** Can be more scalable; potential for passive income after setup is complete.

5.  **Money Considerations:**
    *   **No-Code:** Faster initial income but capped by your client workload, requires scalable solutions.
    *   **Code:** No limit on potential revenue but harder to get started. Success in this route comes from creative, valuable ideas.

**Core Point:**
The core point is to choose between a faster, more time-intensive (no code) path or a slower, more scalable (code) path for creating an AI business in 2025, based on your goals for time commitment, scalability, and preferred type of work.

**Fundamental Point:**
The fundamental point is that success in the AI business space, especially within the code route, relies on creativity and unique ideas, with money being a byproduct rather than the primary motivator.

if I was going to create an AI company for 2025 here are the exact steps I would take for more context of who I am my name is Corbin Brown I created the software bump ups.com that's currently funded by Google so let me give you a real perspective on what actually to create in 2025 when it comes to Ai and business sound good let's jump in welcome back y' now if you're a longtime viewer of my channel you're like Corbin you need to stop saying you created a bum bus I get it I know that message is not for you that's for new viewers that just found my channel on this video as typically with the analytics majority of the views from new viewers I do that as a quick little gut check as a lot of people that do YouTube it's all fake I like to call them posers as why would you watch a video from someone telling you the best AI business to start in 2025 when their entire business is just YouTube it just seems counterintuitive so that's why I give that context in a lot of my videos that I created bump UPS as that gives you at least the knowledge that like okay at least this guy actually did something in the industry rather than just being a poser we don't like posers so let's jump into 2025 When approaching the idea of creating a business specifically with artificial intelligence there's a you can do but there is basically two major paths I've covered both of these paths on my channel of how you would even approach it but the two major paths are this it's either no code or code today's video is obviously in the perspective that you plan on taking an entrepreneurial journey in the sense of creating a business from Ground Zero now if you currently are operating a business that's pretty successful obviously you want to integrate AI in it and I suggest you check out my other playlist when it comes to zap year and integrating automation flows with AI for now though that's not the purpose of this video the purpose of this video is 2025 it sounds weird saying that number as like wasn't it just 2020 did we just lose 5 years so now that we know what our options are let me break this down into a nice little diagram here showing you the risk associated the learning curve Associated and the possible money you could make in either direction let's break it down first major thing learning curve when it comes to learning curve what I mean by this is how long is it going to take you to actually grasp the skills of AI in the context of either no code or code now specifically looking at no code here we're looking at 3 to 6 months here of grasping the skills what are the skills Corbin you're talking into high level I got you we're talking about automation oriented skills EG zapier make you can take this to another level here in the sense of a business that started at the very beginning of this AI Revolution slm Market was the idea of LinkedIn photos right someone would take an AI image generating software You' provide a photo would make it look better with AI this is like no Cod type of implementation of AI so yes you could grind for two weeks straight and learn these skills but to have a very comprehens of understanding looking at a 3 to 6 month timeline so then coming over to code now code encompasses stuff like cursor AI wind Surf vs code replit all these different ways of approaching actually coding out software or web applications now why this is kind of new and fresh is our ability to access AI through API or in other words basically integrate artificial intelligence into a service that we could sell to a potential consumer or business was only truly readily available within the last year 2 years therefore to give you even more perspective think of it like the internet just went live and it's 97 and you have the next like 5 10 years to really create something cool and new the drawback here though is that if You' never coded before or you have a little coding experience to dive into this pool you're looking at one to two years now back in the old days when we didn't have ai to help us code that timeline would probably push up a little bit to 3 to four years but the only reason I say it could be that fast now is due to the fact that we know how to use artificial intelligence in our coding logic and obviously I have a ton of playlist on that so to search up my name the platform I'll show you so that's the service level right there to even enter the AI business Market you're looking at 3 to 6 months on Note code and you're looking at 1 to two years on code therefore what are deliverables in this context and what I mean by deliverables here is basically once you learn the skill of either of these directions how do we monetize it like what's the end goal here so when we come over to no code here we have a couple different options we're looking at AI automation agency we're looking at very Niche Services provided what's an example of this reference back to when I was talking about LinkedIn photos where you basically provide like a okay photo of yourself and then the AI image software would just make it look a little bit better and more oriented towards freelance type of work so your options here really are if you want to become an EIN or another way of saying basically a business entity you're going towards the AI Automation and service route in the context of no code the extra layer here is that you could potentially kind of get in a gray area here where you do a little bit of code here with Niche services but in reality the learning curve here is 3 six months and you're hitting more freelance upwork Fiverr AI AA just kind of stuff that we are implementing and working with current existing businesses and much more AA client-based type of workflow so what are the deliverables when it comes to code there's a couple different options here and this is where it gets a little cool so first major option here which I'm sure is blowing through your feed right now is web apps now I could do a whole video on this and honestly I should web apps are going to be different than what we consider like a mobile app like a IOS app so obviously the second one would be like iOS apps or just mobile apps as a real quick little like Cherry of knowledge as when I first started coding when I was 12 I did iOS development for like four or five years I personally lean on the side of web app development because of the fact of how it works in the sense of iOS development is you have to go through an entire review process from Apple themselves so if you work six months on an app you could actually get rejected by the Apple review team here's a real quick sidetracked story of that so right now in the dating Market when it comes to dating apps like Tinder Bumble hinge there's kind of a monopoly going on what's kind of crazy is that there's stories of other people trying to create dating apps but it gets rejected due to Apple seeing it more of a threshold has been meant in the sense of what's available in the App Store in dating apps knowing this you choose to do a dating app as your development keep that in mind as there's just certain gray areas when it comes to iOS development apps also the big elephant in the room here is no matter what and this is why you can't play fortnite on your phone anymore because there was a lawsuit over this right now at least when I was working for apple or developing for Apple the cut Apple takes is 30% of your Revenue in a web app you get 100% of it obviously expenses on the backend etc etc but you get 100% on it as you can just tell from that little Spiel right there I probably should do a whole video on that for now though let's keep going web apps iOS apps software web apps software they they kind of intermingle the last one here is I'm going to call it Pipelines what is a pipeline the way I want you to think of pipelines is basically let's say you create really good software for example let's just say you provide a software for lawyers and it's really good at doing one specific thing there is a case brought you upload a PDF and then it gives you the specific cases you should reference in the court hearing as you can tell I'm not a lawyer so if you're a lawyer some of this Jame might be a little off point being though you can then sell that as an endpoint that specific pipeline as an endpoint in API documentation and then at scale individuals can use your API endpoint rather than to build out the entire pipeline they get a direct access to that end value point of the analysis of that PDF from that lawyer of whatever the case law is Right point being though is that what makes it super cool you can make money on the surface on a software but you can also sell your end points as value to the end consumer zooming out no code 3 to 6 months AI automation agency Niche Services freelance what's the next question here is time associated with either Choice running any business in reality is going to take up your time there's really no way of getting around that like in reality the only way to make quote unquote money in your sleep and just make passive income is through Equity markets and investing in that kind of Realm and I keep bringing up stocks a lot recently in my channel don't worry I'm not going to turn into a stock Channel but there's some cool strats we could do there for now though when it comes to no code and time Situation's this and here is a little mental exercise I want you to do what's your number what do I mean by that oh and not your number like don't don't put like oh yeah Corin my number is 93144 no okay not not your phone number when I say what's your number I mean how much you want to make a month all right Corbin I want to make $10,000 a month okay how much you going to charge per client you know I want to do a monthly recurring basis let's say $1,000 per client okay that means in order for you to reach your number that's 10 clients I want you to draw this out make an Excel this will give you perspective so for you to hit your number you need 10 clients how much labor is associated with each client how much time do you feel like you need to obligate to each client you know etc etc you don't want to put yourself in a position where you have 10 clients you're making good money but you're like where's the time so when it comes to time this is more open this is more based off what's your number if your number is 4K you could easily probably get two clients for 2K each and proceed but if your number is more than that more time's involved this right here and that mental exercise I put you through was an Excel sheet that I did early on in my business journey I realized really quick that for me to achieve the number I want to make a month going this route would require a lot of my time so how do we counteract this like how do we solve that issue in reality there's only two major ways you can solve that issue first one hiring employees which obviously is going to be a further expense to your company so you can offload the labor or alternatively the price you offer for your services needs to be higher to compensate for the amount of Labor you put in for you to reach $10,000 a month maybe you charge $5,000 per client and now you only have to deal with two individuals rather than 10 keep that in mind as at scale if you're like whoa whoa I got four clients this is good what happens if you get 20 can you even handle that so whatever your number is if you don't have a number here's my rule of thumb if you don't have a number which I feel like most of y'all probably have a number I think we all have a number typically it's just your bottom line whatever you expend on rent Food Services Etc like whatever your bottom line is you want to make more than that this could actually dive into like a whole another conversation of like well how do I mitigate my bottom line obviously live in states of no income tax live in the right area etc etc for now though that's kind of the idea that's why we like Texas no income tax bye-bye California they were charging me 13% I don't like that so then we come over to time here when it comes to code the beauty of code is it's basically robots that work for you on micro Pennies on the dollar it's a very simple way of saying this but the idea here is that you have more ability to leverage your time the ceiling you hit in the no code Strat is scalability when it comes to code though it's very very scalable if you know how to make it correctly that's why the code Strat if you're one individual or two individuals you could make 100 Grand a month just from YouTube because you created the pipelines you created the code and it all works therefore getting to our last piece here for which business a go down is going to be money now personally if you know me and you know this channel I don't think you should do anything where the focal point or the reason you're pushing in a direction is money and the reason I say this is because even if you work your hardest and you brute force your way to win you're still not going to beat that person that just does it out of passion I'm sorry like if you're looking at the code option here and you're like I'm might have to brute force that I wouldn't do it as from my experience and people I know or just in the idea of coding I view coding like drawing a painting like I genuinely enjoy it but obviously once you learn a skill more and have better comprehension of how to approach coding it becomes more enjoyable like the beginning is like riding a bike where you're riding a bike and then you keep falling down and hitting your shin you're like what's going on but then after while it just becomes natural to get on that bike and keep riding that leads us to the last thing money for no code it's your ceiling so when I say ceiling what is the max amount of clientel you can handle in a month and provide the same services at the Quality that you should this way this route you make money a lot faster than the code route like way faster pretty much within one month of skill development you can start making money here for sure the problem here is that we got to figure out your ceiling and that's why doing that thought experiment is good because then you'll get better comprehension of what your ceiling would be that's why in this route and what I've shown on this channel is the best way to do the no code route is create scalable Solutions so for example let's say you're an aiaa you have done a automation workflow for emails for a specific business use that exact same automation workflow resell it to another business that has that paino this is ways so you can compensate for that scalable issue coming over here though to code there's no better way of putting it other than there is no ceiling if you make a successful software there is no ceiling because if your software was built with the correct architecture that's scalable no matter if you have a th000 live users that month or 50,000 live users a month your underlying labor associated with that software is not really that fluctuated obviously if something breaks or airs or whatever you got to get involved but the underlying labor Associated the time you have to put towards the business is no different compared to 2,000 users comparative to 10,000 users users there is no ceiling now obviously there is no ceiling but actually making a successful software in itself is very very difficult how do you win in the code game when it comes to Ai and business and 2025 it's simple the people that are going to win in this realm is creativity and whoever comes up with the best ideas I've done a video showing you how to come up with good ideas based off my own experience so I'll link it up there and at the end here without further Ado that covers the two major routes you can take in 2025 make sure to leave a like it's completely free I'll see you in the next video video make sure to follow my ex to random videos that's my face I'll see you in the next video
