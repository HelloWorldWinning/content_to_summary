Description:
Okay, here's the summary:

**1. Outlined Summary:**

   *   **I. Introduction:**
        *   Romantic love is a universal theme across art and culture.
        *   Scientific studies confirm its existence across cultures.
        *   The experience of love is complex and varies individually and over time.

    *   **II. Defining Love:**
        *   **Liking:** Positive feelings, rewarding company, warmth, and emotional intimacy.
        *   **Loving:** Builds upon liking, adding care and commitment.
        *   **Being "In Love":** Includes liking and loving, plus sexual arousal and attraction.
        *   Love is not a monolithic experience.

    *   **III. Types of Romantic Love:**
        *   **Passionate Love:** Intense longing, obsession, strong feelings of passion.
            *   Often declines over time (20-40% of couples report this).
        *   **Companionate Love:** Emotional intimacy, commitment, and deep attachment.
            *   Tends to increase over time.
        *   Reductions in *companionate* love, more than passionate love, tend to negatively impact relationship longevity.

    *  **IV. Love Over Time:**
        *   Passionate love often diminishes as relationships mature, due to routine, less novelty, and life changes.
        *  Companionate love often increases over time
        *  Reduction in companionate love has a negative effect on a relationship.

    *   **V. Purpose of Love:**
        *   Evolutionarily, love promotes bonding and commitment, which is vital for the survival of offspring.
        *   Human’s long developmental period makes love essential for the species’ survival.

    *   **VI. Biological Basis of Love:**
        *   Passionate love activates brain regions associated with reward and pleasure (like cocaine).
        *   The release of chemicals (oxytocin, vasopressin, dopamine) during passionate love creates feelings of happiness, euphoria, and sexual arousal.
        *   These brain regions aren't activated in non-romantic relationships.

    *  **VII. Love Styles:**
       *   Three primary styles (John Lee):
            * **Eros:** Physical attraction, sex, intense passion
            * **Ludus:** Emotionally distant, game-playing, uncommitted
            * **Storge:**  Trusting, similar interests, affection, less focus on looks
       *   Mixed styles (Lee):
             *   **Mania:** Intense feelings, anxiety about commitment
             *  **Pragma:** Sensible, practical choices for compatibility
             *   **Agape:**  Selfless love, duty-driven

    *  **VIII. Love Style Influences:**
        *  Love styles are related to personality and past relationship experiences, not genetics.
       *  Dark personality traits relate to Ludus or Pragma
       * Insecure attachment leads to Mania.

    *   **IX. Conclusion:**
        *   Despite individual differences, humans are united by a deep fascination with love as social creatures.

**2. Core Point:**

Love is a multifaceted experience, evolving from initial passion to enduring companionship, with its variations and purpose grounded in both psychology and biology.

**3. Fundamental Point:**

The endurance of a romantic relationship is more dependent on the maintenance of companionate love than the fleeting intensity of passionate love.

**4. Overarching Framework:**

The overarching framework of this article is an examination of love through multiple lenses: psychological, evolutionary, biological, and individual styles, to provide a comprehensive view of this universal human experience.

But what about the science? Historical, cultural and even evolutionary evidence suggests love existed during ancient times and across many parts of the world. Romantic love has been found to exist in 147 of 166 cultures looked at in one study. The complexity of love has much to do with how people experience it differently and how it can change over time. Read more: Friday essay: finding spaces for love Like, love, or ‘in love’? Psychological research over the past 50 years has investigated the differences between liking someone, loving someone and being “in love”. Liking is described as having positive thoughts and feelings towards someone and finding that person’s company rewarding. We often also experience warmth and closeness towards the people we like. In some instances we choose to be emotionally intimate with these people. Our brain behaves differently when we’re in love with someone compared to when we like someone. Halfpoint/Shutterstock When we love someone we experience the same positive thoughts and experiences as when we like a person. But we also experience a deep sense of care and commitment towards that person. Being “ in love ” includes all the above but also involves feelings of sexual arousal and attraction. However, research into people’s own views of love suggests that not all love is the same. Passionate vs companionate love Romantic love consists of two types: passionate and companionate love. Most romantic relationships, whether they be heterosexual or same sex , involve both these parts. Passionate love is what people typically consider being “in love”. It includes feelings of passion and an intense longing for someone, to the point they might obsessively think about wanting to be in their arms. Various studies report approximately 20-40% of couples experience a reduction in passionate love over the course of a relationship. Rawpixel.com/ Shutterstock The second part is known as companionate love . It’s not felt as intensely, but it’s complex and connects feelings of emotional intimacy and commitment with a deep attachment toward the romantic partner. How does love change over time? Research looking at changes in romantic love over time typically finds that although passionate love starts high, it declines over the course of a relationship. There are various reasons for this. As partners learn more about each other and become more confident in the long-term future of the relationship, routines develop. The opportunities to experience novelty and excitement can also decline, as can the frequency of sexual activity . This can cause passionate love to subside. It’s reductions in companionate love, moreso than passionate love, that can negatively affect the longevity of a romantic relationship. Monkey Business Images/ Shutterstock Although a reduction in passionate love is not experienced by all couples, various studies report approximately 20-40% of couples experience this downturn. Of couples who have been married in excess of ten years, the steepest downturn is most likely to occur over the second decade . Life events and transitions can also make it challenging to experience passion. People have competing responsibilities which affect their energy and limit the opportunities to foster passion. Parenthood is an example of this. Read more: Love by design: when science meets sex, lust, attraction and attachment In contrast, companionate love is typically found to increase over time. Although research finds most romantic relationships consist of both passionate and companionate love, it’s the absence or reductions in companionate love, moreso than passionate love, that can negatively affect the longevity of a romantic relationship. But what’s the point of love? Love is an emotion that keeps people bonded and committed to one another. From an evolutionary psychology perspective, love evolved to keep the parents of children together long enough for them to survive and reach sexual maturity .

Nattakorn_Maneerat/Shutterstock A biological foundation too Not only is there an evolutionary foundation to love, love is rooted in biology. Neurophysiological studies into romantic love show that people who are in the throes of passionate love experience increased activation in brain regions associated with reward and pleasure. Read more: Love lockdown: the pandemic has put pressure on many relationships, but here's how to tell if yours will survive In fact, the brain regions activated are the same as those activated by cocaine. These regions release chemicals such as oxytocin, vasopressin and dopamine, which produce feelings of happiness and euphoria that are also linked to sexual arousal and excitement. Interestingly, these brain regions are not activated when thinking about non-romantic relationships such as friends. These findings tell us that liking someone is not the same as being in love with someone. What’s your love style? Research has found three primary styles of love. First coined by psychologist John Lee , the love styles are eros, ludus and storge. These styles include people’s beliefs and attitudes about love and act as a guide for how to approach romantic relationships. People high on storge love are trusting and are not needy or dependent on others. BLACKDAY/ Shutterstock Eros This style of love refers to erotic love and is focused on physical attraction and engaging in sex, the quick development of strong and passionate feelings for another and intense intimacy. Ludus This style involves being emotionally distant and often involves “game-playing”. It’s not surprising people who endorse this love style are unlikely to commit, feel comfortable ending relationships and often start a new relationship before ending the current one. Storge Storge is often regarded as a more mature form of love. Priority is given to having a relationship with a person who has similar interests, affection is openly expressed and there is less emphasis on physical attractiveness. People high on storge love are trusting of others and are not needy or dependent on others. Or is a mixture more your style? You may see yourself in more than one of these styles. Evidence suggests some people possess a mixture of the three main love styles; these mixtures were labelled by Lee as mania, pragma and agape. Read more: Darling, I love you ... from the bottom of my brain Manic love includes intense feelings for a partner as well as worry about committing to the relationship. Pragmatic love involves making sensible relationship choices in finding a partner who will make a good companion and friend. Agape is a self-sacrificing love that is driven by a sense of duty and selflessness. The development of personality and people’s past relationship experiences influences a person’s love style. Gustavo Frazao/ Shutterstock Why do you love the way you do? A person’s love style has little to do with their genetics . Rather, it’s associated with the development of personality and a person’s past relationship experiences. Some studies have found people who are high on dark traits, such as narcissism, psychopathy and machiavellianism, endorse more of a ludus or pragma love style. Read more: There are six styles of love. Which one best describes you? People who have an insecure attachment style , involving a high need for validation and preoccupation with relationship partners, endorse more mania love, while those who are uncomfortable with intimacy and closeness do not endorse eros love. No matter the differences in the way love is experienced, one thing remains common for all: we as humans are social animals who have a deep fascination for it.
