Description:
好的，这是一个很复杂的内容，我会尽力以最清晰和简洁的方式进行总结。

**核心思想概要:**

1.  **社会分裂与精英反击：**
    *   特朗普的当选及其总统任期，使得社会阴暗面（如种族歧视、仇恨等）公开化，并在媒体和社交媒体上获得传播，加剧了社会分裂。
    *   社会各界（特别是受过高等教育的精英）受到反击，特朗普有效地利用了那些感到被社会抛弃和被轻视的人的不满。
    *   “羞辱政治”为利用民众不满情绪的政治打开了大门，导致了愤怒、怨恨和不满的政治，缺乏相互理解。

2.  **市场与道德的辩论：**
    *   一个17岁男孩卖肾买iPad和iPhone的案例，引发了关于自由市场、个人责任和道德底线的讨论。
    *   在2000年初的中国，由于市场改革和经济增长，年轻一代对市场有很强的亲市场道德直觉，这种直觉与美国和东欧类似，但与多数欧洲国家不同。
    *   尽管市场繁荣带来自由，人们仍然在寻求市场无法提供的意义，这种寻求道德意义的渴望促使人们关注《正义》这本书。

3.  **市场的局限性与意义的追寻：**
    *   不应将市场和技术视为定义人类目标和终极意义的工具，过分迷信市场和技术会带来失望。
    *   需要将市场安排和技术创新与能够回应更高人类目标的意义、对话和反思结合起来。
    *   需要关注收入和财富的不平等，以及尊严、认可和尊重的缺失。
    *   应通过阶级融合的社会机构，促进不同背景的人相互接触，以便克服社会分裂。

4.  **哲学的责任与历史的影响：**
    *   哲学应关注现实世界，并对哲学思想的实践结果保持警惕，哲学思想可能会被误用。
    *   黑格尔的历史观（历史指向单一的终极目标）可能导致危险的运动，认为历史必然朝着某个方向发展是危险的。
    *   当今最危险的思想包括宗教原教旨主义、极端民族主义和意识形态纯洁性，这些思想都认为道德和人类真理是单一的，错失了人类经验的深刻多元性。
    *   硅谷的科技乌托邦主义（例如超人类主义）也是一种危险的思想，认为技术发展会超越人类的混乱和争议。

5.  **AI时代的挑战：**
    *   AI时代最大的威胁是混淆虚拟社区和真实社区。
    *   哲学的使命是让人摘下虚拟现实的眼镜，并质疑虚拟现实对人类社会的影响。
    *   关于人工智能伴侣和数字虚拟化身的讨论，引发了关于友谊、亲密、生命意义和悲伤的深刻问题。

**核心要点（一句话总结）：**

现代社会的挑战在于如何在市场、科技发展、社会不平等和日益加剧的虚拟化之间找到平衡，并在这些挑战中重新找回人类的意义和价值。

**根本要点（一句话总结）：**

人类社会需要超越市场、科技和意识形态的狭隘视角，重视相互理解、尊重、对话，并在多元化的经验中追求共同的意义。

**总体框架：**

本文的核心是一个 **“社会困境与意义追寻”** 的框架，它包括以下要素：

*   **社会分裂：** 由政治、经济和文化因素加剧的社会两极分化。
*   **市场与道德：** 围绕市场机制、个人责任和道德价值的辩论。
*   **意义危机：** 对物质主义、技术崇拜和意识形态僵化的反思，以及对更深层次人类意义的探索。
*   **哲学的责任：** 哲学在解决现实问题、批判性反思和提供道德指导方面的作用。
*   **AI时代的挑战：** 技术进步对人类经验和价值观造成的潜在影响。

这些要素相互关联，形成了一个复杂的社会、道德和哲学问题网络，需要深入的理解和反思。

became elevated with the presidency of Donald Trump we've struggled more directly and more conspicuously more frontally with the dark side finding public expression on the stage now on the stage public expression rather than kept at the margins and at the periphery and finding a voice in the media and in social media especially and in a now in a presidential campaign that will be a rematch of the one from last time we've seen is a backlash against Elites especially against well-educated Elites professional Elites uh Donald Trump has been very effective at tapping into the Grievances of people who feel they've been left behind and looked down upon humiliation the politics of humiliation and it's this sense of humiliation I think that opened the way for the politics of grievance that Donald Trump has been able to [Music] exploit in the United States today and in many parts of the world is a politics of anger resentment and grievance without Mutual recognition with without recognizing the value of the contributions that people make from different walks of life we will not really begin to address the the resentments that now afflict our politics and have accentuated some of the the darkest strands in in social life invite you to offer your views about an incident a story that I about where a 17-year-old boy sold his kidney you all know the story he bought an iPad and an iPhone but how many think it's okay it's a free market and there's nothing wrong with it because I study economics and I think every adult is an economic man that he has to be responsible for his behaviors he clearly know the consequence of losing one kidney we should give him the chance to take that risk to choose for himself a lot of people agree with that all right that's very good so I would like to hear from those who object yes and tell stand up well I think it's wrong because uh give your kidy to others maybe you feel it's okay but in fact in uh for the respect of a person it is not uh respect of life okay that's very [Music] interesting even facing the same concept like justice yeah you see the difference between from different countries yes yeah it's prompted me to reflect on why there are the these differences when I encountered them when I had these conversations with young people in China in the 2000s what struck me was first they did have very strong prom Market moral intuitions as I mentioned and I would put a lot of examples to students and to the audience asking them whether they think this or that social practice should be governed by money or by other Norms so I put questions like this what struck me was the moral intuitions about buying and selling were similar in the US and China um in Eastern Europe it was similar in Poland for example most European countries it was quite different you think why why similar I I think it's because especially in the uh early 2000s that China had experienced the Young Generation had grown up with the uh Market reforms um and that it had been a period of tremendous economic growth it's kind of freedom for them yeah yeah it was it was an expression of freedom and and Rising affluence but especially of freedom but at the same time they were looking for meaning that markets could not provide and so the search for meaning persisted even after the market triumphalist moment and I I think that one of the reasons that uh people were drawn to the justice this book it was was the sense that there is there are moral meanings that lie Beyond markets and Beyond economics what do you think yeah maybe maybe we we facing two choices or different choices we can't choose the best one there no best one just less evil just less evil one maybe but I wouldn't regard these as closed Alternatives I would I would ask a different question how is it possible to combine the benefits of Market arrangements and technological innovations with sources of meaning deliberation dialogue reflection that can answer to higher human purposes and ends our mistake is not to use markets to organize economic activities our mistake is not to hope that technological innovations will deliver real improvements to the way we live our lives our mistake is the tendency to think that markets and Technology by themselves can Define human purposes and ends they can't MH and when we put too much faith in them when they become a kind of Faith almost a kind of religious Faith markets and Technology then we're bound to be disappointed and when the disappointment comes the disappointment may take harsh dangerous forms M so the situation is so complicated what kind of solution we can provide we try build dialogue but very difficult I think we need to focus Less on arming people for meritocratic competition and focus more on contending with inequalities of income and wealth but also inequalities of honor recognition and esteem and this means we have to renew the Dignity of work we have to broaden our conception about what counts as a valuable contribution to the common good and we need the kind of class mixing institutions in civil society that will lead us to encounter one another to be in one another's presence not only in our phon all the more so when our societies are divided and polarized because the people we encounter tend to be people only like ourselves we need to overcome that mhm but every solution every seral always has its own floor yeah so how about your your your solution your your your attack marital Cy but maybe you through serial your book still has kind of flaw maybe you you must overcome what kind of flaw it is right yeah well what what what pla have you identified let's start with that I don't know maybe too ideal too idealistic too idealistic yeah you think so I don't know what I've just suggested is really too much to hope for mhm I don't think that reducing inequality and renewing the Dignity of work and creating a greater equality of condition and recognition will happen anytime soon they're not easy projects to undertake so I want to be realistic about that but do you think should the philosophy be more responsible for the historical consequence or not idea and the reality Russell Hegel yeah they talk about inquality talk about the virtue but the consequence maybe this one yes extreme opposite yes how how to see the the Paradox if if one thinks and and I as I do that philosophy is always situated in the world that philosophy should attend to the world then philosophy cannot be indifferent and in the philosophy for cannot be indifferent to the way in which various people or parties or movements Implement philosophical ideas so there's always an interplay between political practice and the philosophical ideas that inform it and often they can go off the rails they can go in very U dark directions that the philosopher may never have wanted or anticipated that's always a danger that's that's one of the persisting dangers of philosophy the part of Hegel that has led political practice astray in wrong direction that teaches that history has a single ultimate destination and that it takes a certain shape that has contributed to some of the dangerous movements in history who may have been inspired by the idea that history points in a certain direction and that it's our responsibility either to let history unfold or to help history unfold to reach that Final Destination once and for all I think the phrase or the idea once and for all is a a deeply dangerous idea and I think it's at odds with the philosophical Spirit of questioning contesting offering competing [Music] interpretations in your mind in our time which idea is the most dangerous idea in today's award I would say that the forces today that are most dangerous are the versions of religious fundamentalism or of hyperism or of ideological Purity that all draw in one way or another on the idea that moral truths and human truths are singular that there's only one way of interpreting our past there's only one historical end or destination um there's only one true way of interpreting religious and spiritual traditions because what this misses well it leads to dangerous politics but it also misses the Deep pluralism of The Human Experience so how about the Silicon Valley philosophy is techno driven well ideology yeah yeah it's a part I would say it's a version of this because the most extreme versions of Silicon Valley techno utopianism some have a more specific term of transhumanism or Singularity because they too think that history is on their side they too think that as technology develops and as generative AI develops we will be transcending the messy uh contentious uh pluralist human projects and arriving at a kind of Singularity where perhaps our minds will meld with machines and the Very idea that going to to the moon or to Mars um is kind of a natural outgrowth of this way of thinking where they can start a new it's the ambition really to start from scratch with a clean slate to begin a new unfettered uncomplicated bu disagreement contestation challenge dialogue controversy where they can start a new and build a society from scratch that is not as they might see it weighted down by the controversies that AR that arise whenever human beings Gather in society so there is something it's Fantastical but it's also dangerous and hubristic because it implies that they are the avatars they are the Pioneers the initiators of this new frontier that breaks free from the the messy um need to negotiate to discuss to disagree uh which is essential to The Human Experience for reasonable m for so could you imagine maybe in the coming years everyone has has set here yeah to Immigrant into the metaverse yeah what should philosophy do thinker do in that new era take the goggles off that's what philosophy should do take the goggles off so yes so it would be the the mission of philosophy in a metaverse if it ever came to be would be to try to um take or persuade people to take those goggles off to imagine a world in which the line between what's virtual and what's real yeah blur yeah blurs to the point of Vanishing and here's the question would such a world be recognizable as a human world a world in which we had lost even where we no longer cared even to ask the question yeah how to locate the line between the virtual and the real and I think the deepest um threat in human terms posed by the age of AI is that we will confuse virtual community and connection with the real thing and that would would represent a great loss how to fight with the trend or deal with the trend it's it seems Unstoppable you think it seems Unstoppable see it seems yeah I'm not sure why well it's worth asking in figuring out how to stop it it's worth asking why it seems Unstoppable why do you think just too L too less true debate and the I mean discussion about it I most people just follow the trend right yeah but if if I could MH feel and believe the connection I have through my phone scrolling and swiping and texting and posting that that connection to people half a world away is the same as as valuable as my personal connections to family friends neighbors classmates yeah what would you say to them I don't know why would that represent a loss I guess if yeah why would that represent a l I'm I'm curious about you because you know my phone yeah it's the most intimate things we have we we touch every yeah very intimate you spend more time with with it yeah yeah and even you through the the the social media you you talk with so many people I I think some time even most time because from live different places yeah we through it but still feel kind of very intimate the similar with me yeah face to face right so it's a new community but I'm not so sure about it's less important than the more concrete communities before or the similar I'm so confused about it well so how to understand it the change yeah yeah yeah well and let me ask you this question since we're talking we're talking about intimacy MH intimacy is an important aspect of this there are now ai equipped devices little robots that you can buy let's say you have an aged parent or grandparent who's living alone maybe in a nursing home yeah and who's lonely and you visit them from time to time but you can't be there every day [Music] mhm you can buy one of these robotic companions MH and the robotic companion will carry on a conversation with your loved one your grandmother let's say and let's suppose that your grandmother comes to regard that robotic AI driven companion as a friend as an actual friend sharing intimacies asking advice and suppose that this relieves the loneliness M of your grandmother and makes her happier she considers this her friend would that bother you or would you welcome that welcome you would welcome that it doesn't bother yeah yeah it doesn't bother you at all maybe not at all maybe a little but I accept it you would accept it but what's the little that bother maybe just because it's a new things and needs some time and space to understand it accept it and but if you are Grand this goes back to the what we were discussing about the virtual and the Act and the real now your grandmother no longer recognizes we're assuming mhm the difference between a robotic friend and an actual friend that doesn't bother you do you think there's a loss I think the new friend the toy is friend of her because some books are friends even it's just papers ah books yeah so if the grandmother or if you or I were absorbed in a book yeah even we see some old books it's it's like friends yeah it's it's spend many maybe 12 years with you and well I agree that a book can be a friend and a source of I would say genuine companionship but doesn't matter that when I'm reading a book and absorbed in a book I'm engaged in a kind of exchange with a kind of dialogue with the human author of that book whereas when your grandmother is spending her day conversing with the robot she isn't we talk about sret Plato even it's it's it's 2,000 years ago still can be your friend yes so so why not the the toy why not the toy yeah why not because it's a machine yeah because but yeah can it engage in dialogue we've been talking a lot about dialogue yeah yeah yeah can can or put it this way when take a simple example when we've maybe maybe the toy speak like sret so many information about sret sorts in the toy like a chat chat bot yeah yeah Socratic chat P yeah yeah yeah we can imagine socr from the books from his dialogue yeah from the the books yes maybe she can imagine some similar from the toy yes the toy is like different books because the books is much more sophisticated than I we think even book it's more different layers maybe we just kind touch it maybe several lay layers but more layers which still still can't touch may maybe maybe if the toy has it becomes a sophisticated chat poot that is programmed on Socrates or Dusty yeah well let let me ask you this suppose your grandmother passes away mhm but she has left all of her Digital Data all of her emails all her social media recording of her experiences and created a digital Avatar using machine learning M so that you you're mourning the loss of your loved one but you can still carry on conversations with her and so can your children and so can their children with their great great grandmother and ask her advice can introduce her to a new boyfriend or girlfriend ask her opinion now in principle machine learning AI generated chatbots as they become perfected could provide a kind of virtual immortality in which case the line that's being blurred is not only between the virtual and the actual but between living and and not living what about that would you want to speak to the virtual digital Avatar of your great grandmother maybe I I I maybe I will I guess I would because you because in those days we see picture of them yeah their letters pH read their letters and remember them yeah it's it's still kind of dialogue with the photo with with the letter yeah it is a kind of dialogue yeah it's become a new complicated and more Rich photo and matters yeah so he the so virtual immortality you would welcome virtual in my no I don't know actually I don't know I I think I will it's like maybe in the still the about books the bookshelf yeah around your room you can see different names yeah maybe the AI the robot the virtual reality maybe it's kind of new thing of the Black Books it's Grandma Grand grandparents yeah friends but in that case would you no longer would we no longer grieve or feel sad when someone dies a loved one dies
