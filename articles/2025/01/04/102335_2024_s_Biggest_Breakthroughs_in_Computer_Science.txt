Since ChatGPT launched in 2022, large language 
models have progressed at a rapid pace,   often developing unpredictable abilities.
When GPT-4 came out, it clearly felt like the   chatbot had some level of understanding.
But do these abilities reflect actual   understanding? Or are the models 
simply repeating their training   data like so-called stochastic parrots?
There's a lot of scientific interest and   understanding the capabilities and the 
properties of large language models.  How do we evaluate these large language 
models? We need evaluations that are   clearly relevant to general purpose 
intelligence and language understanding.  Recently, researchers from Princeton and Google 
DeepMind created a mathematically provable   argument for how language models develop so many 
skills – and designed a method for testing them. The results suggest that the 
largest models develop new skills   in a way that hints at understanding.
Language models are basically trained   to solve next-word prediction tasks.
So they are given a lot of text and at   every step it has some idea of what the 
next word is. And that idea is expressed   in terms of a probability. And, and if the 
next word that you actually see didn't get   high enough probability, there's 
a slight adjustment that's done.  And after many, many, many trillions of such small 
adjustments, it learns to predict the next word.  Over time, researchers have observed neural 
scaling laws, an empirical relationship between   the performance of language models and the 
data used to train them. As models improve,   they minimize training loss, or make fewer errors. 
This sudden increase in performance produces new   behaviors – a phenomenon called emergence.
There’s no kind of a scientific explanation   as to why that's happening. So this 
phenomena is not well understood.  The researchers wondered if GPT-4’s 
sudden improvements could be   explained by emergence. Perhaps the model had 
learned compositional generalization -- the   ability to combine language skills.
This was some kind of meta capability.   There was no mathematical framework to 
think about that. And so we had to come   up with a mathematical framework.
The researchers found their first   hint by considering neural scaling laws.
So the scaling laws already suggest that there is   some statistical phenomenon going on underneath.
So random graphs have a long history in terms of   thinking about statistical phenomena.
So that was one reason to   think of a random graph model.
Random graphs are made of nodes,   which are connected by randomly generated edges. 
The researchers built their mathematical model   with bipartite graphs, which contain two types 
of nodes: one representing chunks of text,   and the other, language skills.
The edges of the graph – the   connections – correspond to which skill is 
needed to understand that piece of text.  Now, the researchers needed to connect these 
bipartite graphs to actual language models.   But there was a problem.
We don't have access to   the training data. So if I'm evaluating 
that language model on my evaluation set,   how do I know that the language model hasn't 
seen that data into the training corpus?  There was one crucial piece of information 
that the researchers could access.  Using that scaling law, we made a prediction:
As models get better at predicting the next word,   they will be able to combine 
more of the underlying skills.  According to random graph theory, every 
combination arises from a random sampling   of possible skills. If there are 100 skill nodes 
in the graph, and you want to combine four skills,   then there are about 100 to the fourth power, 
or one hundred million, ways to combine them.  The researchers developed a test called 
Skill Mix to evaluate if large language   models can generalize to combinations of 
skills they likely hadn’t seen before.  So the model is given a list of skills and 
a topic. And then it's supposed to create a   piece of text on that topic 
using that list of skills.  For example, the researchers asked GPT-4 
to generate a short text about sewing   that exhibits spatial reasoning, 
self-serving bias, and metaphor. Here’s what it answered: “In the labyrinth of 
sewing, I am the needle navigating between the   intricate weaves. Any errors are due to the faulty 
compass of low-quality thread, not my skill.”  We showed in our mathematical framework that as we 
scale up, the model is able to learn these skills.  You would see this increase in compositional 
capability as you scale up the models.  When given the Skill Mix test, small language 
models struggled to combine just a couple of   skills. Medium-sized models could combine two 
skills more comfortably. But the largest models,   like GPT-4, could combine five or six 
skills. Because these models couldn’t have   seen all possible combinations of skills, the 
researchers argue that it must have developed   compositional generalization through emergence.
Once the model has learned these language skills,   model can generalize to random 
unseen compositions of these   skills, because of which we see sudden emergence.
What they showed was that their mathematical model   had this property of compositionality, 
and that by itself gives this ability   to compose new combinations from existing 
pieces. And that is really the hallmark   of novelty and the hallmark of creativity.
And so the argument is that, in fact, large   language models can move beyond 
being stochastic parrots.  The researchers are already working to extend 
the Skill Mix evaluation to other domains as   part of a larger effort to understand the 
capabilities of large language models.  Can we create an ecosystem of Skill Mix 
which is not just valid for language skills,   but mathematical skills as well as coding skills?
Skill Mix was one example where we made a   prediction by just mathematical thinking, and 
that was correct. But there are all kinds of   other phenomena that we probably are not aware 
of, and we need some understanding of that. Quantum systems are some of the 
most complex structures in nature. To model them, you need to compute 
a Hamiltonian – a super-equation   that describes how particles interact locally to 
produce the system’s possible physical properties. But entanglement spreads information 
across the system, correlating particles   that are far apart. This makes computing 
Hamiltonians exceptionally difficult.  You have a giant system of atoms. It's a very 
big problem to learn all those parameters. You could never hope to write down the 
Hamiltonian because it's too large. If you ever even tried to write it down, 
the game would be over and you wouldn't   have an efficient algorithm.
People were actually trying to   prove that efficient algorithms 
were impossible in this regime.  But a team of computer scientists from 
MIT and UC Berkeley cracked the problem.  They created an algorithm that can 
produce the Hamiltonian of a quantum   system at any constant temperature.
The results could have big implications   for the future of quantum computing and 
understanding exotic quantum behavior.  So when we have systems that 
behave and do interesting   things like superfluidity and superconductivity,
you want to understand the building blocks and how   they fit together to create those properties that 
you want to harness for technological reasons.  So we're trying to learn this object, 
which is the Hamiltonian. It's defined by   a small set of parameters. And what we're 
trying to do is learn these parameters.  What we have access to is these experimental 
measurements of the quantum system. So   the question then becomes can you learn a 
description of the system through experiments?  Previous efforts in Hamiltonian learning 
produced algorithms that could measure   particles at high temperatures. But 
these systems are largely classical,   so there’s no entanglement between the particles. The MIT and Berkeley team set their sights 
on the low-temperature quantum regimes.  I wanted to understand what kinds of strategies 
worked algorithmically on the classical side,   and what could be manifestations of 
those strategies on the quantum side?  Once you look at the problem in the right 
way and you bring to bear these tools,  it turns out that you can really 
make progress on these problems.  First, the team ported over a tool from classical 
machine learning called polynomial optimization.   This allowed them to approximate 
the measurements of their system   as a family of polynomial equations.
We were like, maybe we can write Hamiltonian   learning as a polynomial optimization problem, 
and if we manage to do this, maybe we can try   to optimize this polynomial system efficiently.
So all of a sudden it's in a domain that's more   familiar, and you have a bunch of 
algorithmic tools at your disposal.  You can't solve polynomial systems, 
but what you can do is you can sort   of solve a relaxation of them.
We use something called the sum   of squares relaxation to actually 
solve this polynomial system.  Starting with a challenging polynomial 
optimization problem, the team used the   sum of squares method to relax its constraints. 
This expanded the equations to a larger allowable   set of solutions, effectively converting 
it from a hard problem to an easier one.  The real trick is to argue that when 
you've expanded the set of solutions,   you can still find a good solution inside it.
So you need a procedure to take that approximate,   relaxed solution and round it back into an actual 
solution to the problem you really cared about.  So that’s where the coolest 
parts of the proof happen.  The researchers proved that the sum of squares 
relaxation could solve their learning problem,   resulting in the first efficient Hamiltonian 
algorithm in a low-temperature regime.  So we first make some set of measurements of 
the macroscopic properties of the system. And   then we use these measurements to set up a 
system of polynomial equations. And then we   solve this system of polynomial equations for the 
unknown Hamiltonian. The output is a description   of the local interactions in the system.
It was quite eye-opening that there are actually   some very interesting learning problems that are 
at the heart of understanding quantum systems.  This combination of tools is really 
interesting – is something I haven't   seen before. I'm hoping it's 
like a useful perspective with   which to tackle other questions as well.
I think we find ourselves at the start   of this new bridge between theoretical 
computer science and quantum mechanics.
