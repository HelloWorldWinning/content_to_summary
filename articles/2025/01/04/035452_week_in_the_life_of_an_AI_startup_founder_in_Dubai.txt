here is weak in the life of an AI startup founder in Dubai my name is David Andre and I'm a 22-year-old entrepreneur from the Czech Republic in this video you'll see the ups and downs of building an AI startup how I'm utilizing AI to work faster and what it's like to live in the UAE during December so right now I'm implementing authentication into V and actually I'm have a error where even when I'm log in it throws me back to the login screen so now I need to fix this so what does your day look like to be honest it's mostly work like I try to leave the apartment at least once or twice a day but if you actually want to build something you have to put into hours you know like Elon said work hard like every waking hour the main thing is adding the stri payments creating some UI for that making sure there's a proper flow and create some logo I still don't have a long yeah so I'm still fixing the error I've written down some intuitions here just over complicated setup was building too fast and this is I guess one of the biggest lessons is that to move quickly sometimes it is better to go slowly like do it properly really understand what's happening instead of letting AI do do everything so what's it like building a setup in Du way to be honest it doesn't matter like sure you have 0% access and all that stuff but as long as you have internet and a computer it's all you need so do you have any developers no right now it's just me Bo you can afford it that's true but if you hire too soon you will not have understanding of how the code works I need to understand how the back end and front end works together so that when I hire I know if the person is good or if they're just wasting my time so what's your plan for the next one hour and a half what do you want to accomplish honestly I just want to fix this bug like the login issue has been persisting since yesterday basically so the last like 5 hours maybe once I do that it will unlock a lot more things I can do so this is the reality of the startup you know it's not just like adding features and improving the product sometimes you just get stuck on the most random and until you fix that you cannot proceed further so that's the reality what do you think is going to be a big feature for a in terms of real life scenarios like for example when the waiter just came up to us and was writing everything down I think it would have been easier if the agent was talking into the microphone and yeah but you have to think multiple levels ahead of that right like if we decide to go somewhere our AI agent is going to already browse the website of the restaurant check the menu it will know our dietary preferences how many calories everything has it will contact the AI agent from the restaurant and tell them exactly when we're coming and what we need and we we just come and we'll have the food ready I'm probably talking like 10 years from now right it depends how fast things move what you're saying is essentially there's going to be much more opportunities Than People realize with a yeah like the reason I I decided to build vectal is because I had that issue of having too many tasks every single day so I it's like okay there's needs to be a solution for this and that's where the idea for veal was born what are your thoughts on the dangers of AI and what do you think is is the dangerous part of AI I think the best take on this comes from and reason that the biggest risk is basically a single company or single entity having access to AGI right like for example if open AI cancels the AGI clause in their Microsoft deal it would mean that Microsoft assuming open a gets there first it mean that Microsoft would have basically complete control over AGI and a lot of people myself included would probably not want that future right I think that's by far the biggest risk so how do you think AI is going to replace a lot of real life positions when we were booking this there were like multiple people just pointing us where to go what is the purpose of that job as you said that could be an engineer you know that person could be working on something more important one thing people don't realize about jobs being replaced is that it makes everything cheaper there's like 20 people here doing nothing they're just standing around pointing you where to go this is a massive positive of AI optimization is that most services and products will become a lot more affordable so what did you just find out yeah basically I figured that our code is completely different than the super based documentation this is just a basic mistake of not following the dogs but even like perplexity cannot find the second file so the way the website is structured basically if like AI agent scrapes this it will just see one file here but there's a second file and the code is hidden until you click it this is one of the rare scenarios where AI can't help you so why would you say to people who are actually trying to get into this space but they're they just get scared by the code they see a terminal they don't know what any of it means they start doing a bit of research but then they just give up because there just code and lines that they don't understand depends what you want to do right like if you want to build a quick Chrome extension you can do that in 30 minutes 60 Minutes easily if you want to build an AI startup like it's going to be hard no matter what so what time do you normally you wake up and go to bed how do you prioritize sleep yeah I mean today I woke up at like 8:40 and I just wake up when I wake up so I don't have alarms and I think this is actually a mistake a lot of beginner entrepreneurs make they sacrifice their sleep because they think like oh I get more time but unless you're working 16 hours insanely productively you will lose focus you will lose productivity well sacrificing sleep and why would you say people who say Elon Musk gets six hour sleep and he's one of the most productive people on earth yeah but I would say you're not El mask so with that mind what's your plan for today now I mean the plan is pretty simple just spend you know as many hours as possible on building veal like the the road map is here I'm obviously still debugging the error if it does persist I'll keep debug debugging it until it's finished because you know you can't really launch an app with a loop error in the log that's so like the a spaces is it's growing faster and faster like exponentially faster I mean bolt was released what 3 four months ago and then wind surf was only released a month ago how are you even keeping up to date with what AI tools use it's like it's gotten to a point in the last month I think where it's actually not possible for a single individual to be up to dat with everything just so many new models so many new AI tools and all of the current AI tools are improving as well right so like maybe you tried Gemini Advanced 5 months ago but it's not the same as the current one right the only way to stay up today is really try to use as many of them as possible so how do you see Vector evolving over the next few years basically to summarize that like all the productivity actions should be done from V cuz like every there's going to be a agents everywhere and even like creating an event in Google Calendar is so slow you know just like you have to do so many clicks why not just send one message to an agent and he does it so Deon just released a $500 subscription yeah what do you think of the new subscriptions ow promoe $200 $500 de you think this going to be normal if you look back a week or you know two weeks all AI subscriptions were like 20 bucks but now we have $200 subscription $500 subscription soon we will have thousand 2,000 like bro it's like impossible to keep up so we have to stay focused and accept that this is the reality now and do our best to try all of the tools but you know stay focused on the main thing which is V AI so compared to ow Pro mode and gbd4 how long was Deon thinking for well it's not just thinking right it's doing okay so this is 12 minutes from from my response here until my response here so it's basically like it's a complet it's something completely different it's like AI employee rather than just a tool so it like proposes changes then implements them sees if that fix the issue if it didn't reviews them proposes different changes it's now Thursday morning we're hoping to release this early this week but I guess this is the behind the scenes boring that people just don't see right exactly like you can never predict how long you get stuck on some errors right what do you think would take you like multiple days you can do in a few hours sometimes you get stuck on something that you expect it to be done in like 2 hours you get stuck for there two or 3 days it's really unpredictable especially if it's your first startup your building but I guess you know that's that's to game I see you decided to change location yeah alarm waste of time and so this is the beauty of working on a laptop right for alarm drill but it doesn't prevent you from being able to work definitely especially if you have a solid you know MacBook or Windows laptop or you can just take it and it'll be basically as productive as you would be your full set up I get these messages and this basically fentic validating that these are not allowed but right now it's expecting to have all of them so yeah very dumb error but I need to fix it we're going to switch up the sections a little bit and we will do an AI meme review now yeah I guess I I guess it's true you know people who are proactive will keep their jobs for sure I don't know if this is a meme though seems more like advice but yeah in terms of advice 8 out of 10 in terms of meme probably three out of 10 yeah this is good it's a good meme although probably will be even like the current ones are already pretty good right in 6 months 12 months probably won't be an issue at all but yeah like solid meme N9 out of 10 probably so yeah I mean human labor will be obviously replaced so anything human made will be premium quality I guess the same way handmade stuff is now you know it's not from a factory it's like handmade personal uh I guess six out of 10 yeah this is for sure true like a lot of it depends right because the programmers like the researchers and engineers at open Ai and thropic they know what's happening but probably the like a lowlevel medium level programmers that are writing code tools like Devon will probably replace them in the near future so yeah this is this is 9 of of 10 I mean it is true though there is so much bias so much just not factual information just wrong information the training data that the AI inherits but also the hallucinations are not necessarily because of the training usually because of missing gaps in the training data so factually this is not completely correct so probably like 7 out of 10 yeah I think the Tesla B memes are super funny and it's also Al kind of changing the perception of people right like it's kind of putting it into the overturn window like it's okay to talk about this it's okay to like more and more people are kind of understanding that this is the future but even a year ago I I don't think these memes would kind of fly so also Tesla is kind of capitalizing on the humanoid robots right it's always my Tesla robot instead of just my humanoid robot so the masterful marketing from Elon but I don't know if this would be like a realistic scenario so yeah probably like five out of 10 so I'm just using o mini to kind of optimize my system prompt right here I pasted it in I told it to list out seven suggestions and then I told it to be B specific and it started doing the reasoning in Chinese or whatever this is Korean mix of Chinese look at this open AI quangang python androp grand.com this is insane bro and so you're not Chinese right no and there's nothing in this that indicates Chinese Korean Japanese no Asian characters but it's just starting doing the reasoning in these Asian characters I don't know what language this is today is looking like a pretty productive day I think so basically I mean you can say that the app has been launched I mean right now I unlaunched it because I'm adding the payments but we already had like multiple people quickly create an account like seven eight people you know just checked the the domain and created an account right now the progress is happening good happening fast after like few days of slow progress so you already got about 7 users before doing any hair call actions on your Channel or anything this was all just from people checking the domain like going to v. just checking you know whe whether it's up or not so people checked it saw that the website loads so they just logged in with Google and some people got free access for a few hours we look at if we look at the usage in in thropic dashboard you can see that no it's spiked right here now I'm adding the payments so after the payments there's still a bunch of like more secur stuff I have to do but yeah I mean we're getting closer to the actual launch I mean technically it's already launched but what launch means in this context is like us starting to push it first in the new Society to the exclusive members and then like a day or two later on YouTube right really to the entire audience so yeah so these models they're meant for the general public they're meant for pretty much anyone can use a right who is vect made for veal the target audience is really like productive individuals right so whether that is entrepreneurs content creators managers Freelancers anybody who uses tasks anybody who needs to you know be productive and keep an account of what to do and needs to maximize their time of their productivity and you have integrated AI agents that help you execute faster so that's why the tag line is the future of productivity and so this week was kind of a grin to get the app launched you think it's it's going to kind of consistently status right now or do you think it's going to calm down a bit yeah I think it's going to be like this until I get the first developer probably because at any time you know the server could could go down and if I'm the only developer then doesn't matter what I'm doing I just need to fix it otherwise people either cannot access the app or cannot purchase the app right like but also I shouldn't Rush highing the development like I should get somebody who fits the culture fits the vision and has drive not just trying to fill the position with someone who is good at web development Bo especially when you're starting a new business no matter what you're doing to have a promoter on YouTube is a game changer but what would you say to someone who doesn't have a YouTube channel and wants to start or doesn't have any form of marketing and wants to start a startup how would you recommend they Market their startup I would definitely recommend them to worry about the marketing before they worry about the IDE and anything else like I had a clear plan of how I would promote veal even before I chose the idea for the startup a lot of people just you know this is one one of the biggest mistakes that stof Founders make they like to code they like to build they don't like to do the marketing and promotion but without that you will never see the first initial wave that is required to start growing organically in Word of Mouth you know like if if you don't have any mouths you cannot do word of mouth so so what would you say like like someone is like okay I want to do marketing but I just don't know what to do I have no ideas I don't know what to record just start uploading updates on YouTube on Twitter you know showing demos of your tool like how it progressing start making content related to that you have to know what your target audience is right like I'm very I have a really good idea of what the target audience for vectal is so you have to make content that will attract those people you have to create either a personal brand or brand for the for the startup so you have to just start uploading something man you know it's just as important as building the product promoting it so you think building a personal brand around yourself is more important than a a brand earn the product depends but if you have a personal brand then you can have many products right so how are we looking with the straight payments yeah I'm making progress on it understanding more the different parts required you know UI changing the offlow setting up correctly inside of stripe now I'm figuring out the UI right like somebody pays I mean somebody logs in then they pay and then they enter the app so I need to insert this middle component simple checkout page for stripe and yeah just make make sure that's connected to the API so I think what you're doing now is a good example of going slower in order to move faster right yeah definitely like right now so far I've been basically trying to do everything with the AI but now I think it's time to also combine some YouTube videos from actual humans because payments just like authentication are not easy right like there's a lot of moving Parts a lot of stuff that can go wrong and especially if you do it for the first time like right now have multiple errors or things that need to be changed so the the page layout is not centered you know you can bypass it by just going to Local Host and not pay at all so I mean obviously like some of them are like not crucial some of them are more nice to have but overall it's just you know it doesn't work can show you the flow see like this is line to the left but clicking on this boom 404 error and even if I just like remove this from the URL I can just access the main app without paying so yeah a lot of problems that need to be fixed and I don't know we'll see hopefully once I watch a few videos I'll have better understanding and I can move faster one thing I realized is like the development of a AI startup is literally like a slow exponential and you're grinding away at the curve because right now like I have so much ignorance that so much technical thatt I don't have you know connections like you said it pretty well like once I have you know three different front end guys three different back end guys like any error would be so faster to solve cuz I would know like the right person to hit up well right now I'm just like messaging Claud you know perplexity they I have outdated information they have to watch a tutorial there's like a lot of friction and a lot of you know just ignorance from my side where I don't know what to do once I have those connections once I have a lot more knowledge and you know momentum then like the development will start to speed up right and especially like once you have like developers on your team then you can really start hitting the fast growth this is what I think people fail to visualize it's like the slow exponential and grinding against the curve and they stop in this like flat part right and they never get to the gains and so what is going to be your strategy for hiring developers are you just going to try hire quickly and and grow your team exponentially or you're going to try just find the right person one at a time yeah probably that I want to keep it uh tight you know like I think telegram is a great example for the employees for the billion valuation but another I've seen also another tweet from a guy recently who say it's going to be possible to create1 billion apps with 20 people or less so and he he was actually building that as well so this is definitely what I want to do make sure you're using these AI tools but basically assume you don't have them like proceed as if you didn't have them but use them all the time because so many people just Outsource all their thinking to AI tools and then they expect them to solve everything and then they get stuck and then quit and do you think the new St is good for someone who does have any experience with coding and with steing an a setup yeah for sure I mean in the new Society I show everything I'm doing right I'm showing all the mistakes I'm do commenting basically behind the scenes of the startup making all these mistakes so that the people that want to do it they don't have to do it and they can do it faster than even me so definitely I I don't think there's any other resource of someone being a complete beginner showing how he's using AI tools to build an AI startup MH so you're basically uploading the extended C of this video that's going on YouTube in new C right yeah I mean not can load it up here so like every day every other day I just post a quick update like you know 4 to 8 minutes usually in in the mon free which by the way it is accessible for everybody so as you can see we're on day 19 right now and I'm just sharing everything all the learnings all the lessons so that people in the new Society can benefit without making the same mistakes in terms of uncensored models I guess do you think that it's going to be easy to access on sensored models in the future cuz already with model like dolphin it's which is meant to be uncensored it's it's already hard to get a censored version of dolphin it's it's already semi sensored I guess again thinking from first principles there's going to be more and more interest in uncensored models as more and more people you know are in the AI field and the adaptation especially the last 6 months like the amount of interest in the AI field has been exploding like right now you can go to Venice Ai and get multiple uncensored models now you still have to be like a little bit clever how you prompt it right you don't to be like most dumbass prompt that still causes it to like refuse or ask questions but if you prompt it in a clever way you can get these you know dolphin models to basically tell you anything what's the main reason for even using an uncensor model cuz people are just going to assume that you're just trying to do something illegal yeah but there's a lot of different reasons right like the main one for me is just not being brainwashed like when I ask it for optimal diet I don't want to be forcing a vegan diet on me or stuff like that right because that's that's what happens when you have these built-in biases and that's the real danger is that when you have these companies you know from San Francisco they put in their own bias into the rhf into the reinforcement learning so that the models then have these beliefs and they like slowly over time as you interact with them you know hundreds of times thousands of times they slowly nudge you in that direction and that's like slow brainwashing where you don't notice it today there wasn't much progress made with the startup I mean we did go jet scheme but that only took about two hours the rest of the day was spent uploading this video right yeah plus call oh but David you're you know you don't have like I guess a full-time job you can just work on your for as many hours as you want but people can now see that you're actively running a community with 600 people plus uploading consistently on your YouTube channel plus joining all these calls there's a lot going on behind the scenes you're not just running yeah I mean the YouTube channel is essentially a full-time job plus the community is a full-time job right like now I have a team that helps me out but like you know you get there slowly so if I if I didn't have that team yeah maybe I wouldn't have as much time but like anybody can still find one hour two hours a day I mean I I don't believe there's people who like really can't find that if you really want to so after 62 days I literally started almost exactly two months ago veal is finally launched to the public the payments are done we did a bunch of testing with people on my team and actually right now I got the first paying customer right here probably going to have to blur some of his details but shout out to Wes you're the first paying customer for v l it's been pretty exciting two months but the journey has only begun so can't wait to see what you guys think about veal
