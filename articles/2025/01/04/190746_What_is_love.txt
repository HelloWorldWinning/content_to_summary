Description:
Okay, here's a summary of the provided text, structured as requested:

**Summary:**

**I. Defining Love:**
    *   **A. Liking vs. Loving vs. Being "In Love":**
        *   Liking: Positive feelings, rewarding company, warmth, closeness.
        *   Loving: Includes liking, plus a deep sense of care and commitment.
        *   Being "in love": Includes all the above, plus sexual arousal and attraction.
    *   **B. Two Types of Romantic Love:**
        *   Passionate Love: Intense longing, obsessive thoughts, often associated with "being in love".
        *   Companionate Love: Emotional intimacy, commitment, deep attachment; less intense but complex.

**II. Love Over Time:**
    *   **A. Passionate Love:** Typically starts high but declines over time due to routines, reduced novelty, and lower sexual activity.
    *   **B. Companionate Love:** Typically increases over time.
    *   **C. Relationship Longevity:**  Reductions in *companionate* love, more than passionate love, negatively impact a relationship’s longevity.

**III. The Purpose and Biology of Love:**
    *   **A. Evolutionary Purpose:** To keep parents together long enough to raise children to maturity.
    *   **B. Biological Basis:** Passionate love activates reward and pleasure centers in the brain (similar to cocaine) releasing chemicals like oxytocin, vasopressin, and dopamine, linked to arousal and excitement.
    *   **C. Distinction:** Brain activity during romantic love differs from that during non-romantic (platonic) relationships.

**IV. Love Styles:**
    *   **A. Primary Styles (John Lee):**
        *   Eros: Physical attraction, passion, intense intimacy.
        *   Ludus: Emotionally distant, "game-playing", non-committal.
        *   Storge: Trusting, mature, emphasis on shared interests, less on physical attractiveness.
    *   **B. Mixed Styles (John Lee):**
        *   Mania: Intense feelings, anxiety about commitment.
        *   Pragma: Sensible partner choices based on companionship and friendship.
        *   Agape: Self-sacrificing, selfless love.
    *   **C. Factors influencing style:** Personality, past relationships, not genetics. People with dark traits often show Ludus/Pragma styles. Insecure attachment is linked to mania and discomfort with intimacy to not endorsing eros.

**V. Conclusion:**
    * Despite the variations in the experience of love, one thing is common: Humans, as social creatures, are deeply fascinated by it.

**Core Point:**  While love is a complex experience with differing types and styles, it ultimately serves to bond and commit individuals both emotionally and for the purpose of human evolution.

**Fundamental Point:** Love, as both an emotion and a biological drive, is essential for the survival and evolution of the human species.

**Overarching Framework:** The content uses a **scientific and psychological lens** to explore the various facets of love, including its definition, evolution, biology, dynamics over time, and differing styles.

But what about the science? Historical, cultural and even evolutionary evidence suggests love existed during ancient times and across many parts of the world. Romantic love has been found to exist in 147 of 166 cultures looked at in one study. The complexity of love has much to do with how people experience it differently and how it can change over time. Read more: Friday essay: finding spaces for love Like, love, or ‘in love’? Psychological research over the past 50 years has investigated the differences between liking someone, loving someone and being “in love”. Liking is described as having positive thoughts and feelings towards someone and finding that person’s company rewarding. We often also experience warmth and closeness towards the people we like. In some instances we choose to be emotionally intimate with these people. Our brain behaves differently when we’re in love with someone compared to when we like someone. Halfpoint/Shutterstock When we love someone we experience the same positive thoughts and experiences as when we like a person. But we also experience a deep sense of care and commitment towards that person. Being “ in love ” includes all the above but also involves feelings of sexual arousal and attraction. However, research into people’s own views of love suggests that not all love is the same. Passionate vs companionate love Romantic love consists of two types: passionate and companionate love. Most romantic relationships, whether they be heterosexual or same sex , involve both these parts. Passionate love is what people typically consider being “in love”. It includes feelings of passion and an intense longing for someone, to the point they might obsessively think about wanting to be in their arms. Various studies report approximately 20-40% of couples experience a reduction in passionate love over the course of a relationship. Rawpixel.com/ Shutterstock The second part is known as companionate love . It’s not felt as intensely, but it’s complex and connects feelings of emotional intimacy and commitment with a deep attachment toward the romantic partner. How does love change over time? Research looking at changes in romantic love over time typically finds that although passionate love starts high, it declines over the course of a relationship. There are various reasons for this. As partners learn more about each other and become more confident in the long-term future of the relationship, routines develop. The opportunities to experience novelty and excitement can also decline, as can the frequency of sexual activity . This can cause passionate love to subside. It’s reductions in companionate love, moreso than passionate love, that can negatively affect the longevity of a romantic relationship. Monkey Business Images/ Shutterstock Although a reduction in passionate love is not experienced by all couples, various studies report approximately 20-40% of couples experience this downturn. Of couples who have been married in excess of ten years, the steepest downturn is most likely to occur over the second decade . Life events and transitions can also make it challenging to experience passion. People have competing responsibilities which affect their energy and limit the opportunities to foster passion. Parenthood is an example of this. Read more: Love by design: when science meets sex, lust, attraction and attachment In contrast, companionate love is typically found to increase over time. Although research finds most romantic relationships consist of both passionate and companionate love, it’s the absence or reductions in companionate love, moreso than passionate love, that can negatively affect the longevity of a romantic relationship. But what’s the point of love? Love is an emotion that keeps people bonded and committed to one another.

Nattakorn_Maneerat/Shutterstock A biological foundation too Not only is there an evolutionary foundation to love, love is rooted in biology. Neurophysiological studies into romantic love show that people who are in the throes of passionate love experience increased activation in brain regions associated with reward and pleasure.

These regions release chemicals such as oxytocin, vasopressin and dopamine, which produce feelings of happiness and euphoria that are also linked to sexual arousal and excitement. Interestingly, these brain regions are not activated when thinking about non-romantic relationships such as friends. These findings tell us that liking someone is not the same as being in love with someone. What’s your love style? Research has found three primary styles of love. First coined by psychologist John Lee , the love styles are eros, ludus and storge. These styles include people’s beliefs and attitudes about love and act as a guide for how to approach romantic relationships. People high on storge love are trusting and are not needy or dependent on others. BLACKDAY/ Shutterstock Eros This style of love refers to erotic love and is focused on physical attraction and engaging in sex, the quick development of strong and passionate feelings for another and intense intimacy. Ludus This style involves being emotionally distant and often involves “game-playing”. It’s not surprising people who endorse this love style are unlikely to commit, feel comfortable ending relationships and often start a new relationship before ending the current one. Storge Storge is often regarded as a more mature form of love. Priority is given to having a relationship with a person who has similar interests, affection is openly expressed and there is less emphasis on physical attractiveness. People high on storge love are trusting of others and are not needy or dependent on others. Or is a mixture more your style? You may see yourself in more than one of these styles. Evidence suggests some people possess a mixture of the three main love styles; these mixtures were labelled by Lee as mania, pragma and agape. Read more: Darling, I love you ... from the bottom of my brain Manic love includes intense feelings for a partner as well as worry about committing to the relationship. Pragmatic love involves making sensible relationship choices in finding a partner who will make a good companion and friend. Agape is a self-sacrificing love that is driven by a sense of duty and selflessness. The development of personality and people’s past relationship experiences influences a person’s love style. Gustavo Frazao/ Shutterstock Why do you love the way you do? A person’s love style has little to do with their genetics . Rather, it’s associated with the development of personality and a person’s past relationship experiences. Some studies have found people who are high on dark traits, such as narcissism, psychopathy and machiavellianism, endorse more of a ludus or pragma love style.

People who have an insecure attachment style , involving a high need for validation and preoccupation with relationship partners, endorse more mania love, while those who are uncomfortable with intimacy and closeness do not endorse eros love. No matter the differences in the way love is experienced, one thing remains common for all: we as humans are social animals who have a deep fascination for it.
