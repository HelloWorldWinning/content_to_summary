好的，以下是对您提供的文本的总结，我将尽力做到**简洁清晰**并遵循您的要求，所有回复都将使用**简体中文**。

**1. 核心思想概要:**

*   **引言：** 针对社会上的报复行为，明确指出无差别的报复是不可接受的，真正的正义不能与同情心对立，缺乏同情心的人不能成为真正的英雄。
*   **以史为鉴：**
    *   **《战国策·唐雎不辱使命》：**  通过唐雎与秦王的对话，展现了古代士人面对强权时的勇气和智慧，强调真正的愤怒应源于正义，而非个人私欲。唐雎的愤怒是为捍卫国家和正义，秦王的愤怒则源于个人私欲和恐吓。
    *  **孟子论“勇”：** 指出真正的勇在于维护社会正义，而非滥用权力，以个人私欲为出发点的怒火。
    *   **韩愈《送孟东野序》:**  阐述了“不平则鸣”的人性，指出社会不公会引发人们的反抗和呼喊，而这种呐喊是社会进步的动力。
*   **当代反思：**
    *   **“猴子实验”：** 通过实验，揭示了群体性暴力和“欺软怕硬”的心理机制，讽刺了那些不敢挑战权力者，转而攻击弱者的行为。
    *   **对“正义”的曲解：** 批判了那些以“正义”之名，行报复之实的伪善行为，指出真正的正义必须基于同情心和同理心。
    *   **“雪崩论”的滥用：** 批评那些引用“雪崩时，没有一片雪花是无辜的”来为自己报复行为开脱的人，强调他们缺乏真正的反思和勇气。
*   **结尾：** 强调真正的英雄应具备勇气、理性和同情心，而非以暴制暴，并引用了多句古语反驳那些以无差别报复为借口的行为。

**2. 核心结论 (一句总结):**
真正的愤怒和正义是基于同情和理智，而非对弱者的无差别施暴，更不应以“正义”之名行懦弱和报复之实。

**3. 根本结论 (一句总结):**
真正的英雄和正义行为源于内在的道德感和同情心，绝非出于懦弱的报复心理和对弱者的施暴。

**4. 总体框架/概念地图:**

*   **中心主题:** 批判无差别的报复行为，并阐述真正的英雄主义和正义观。
*   **历史视角:** 通过古代的例子（唐雎、孟子、韩愈），来阐述中国传统文化中对勇气、愤怒和正义的理解。
*   **现实批判:** 通过“猴子实验”和对社会现象的分析，揭示当代社会中存在的伪善和懦弱。
*  **论证逻辑：**
    *   提出问题：对无差别的报复行为提出质疑和批判。
    *   古代事例：通过经典故事和名言，论证真正的勇气和正义应有的样子。
    *   现实分析：揭示当代社会中，人们如何曲解正义并为自己的错误行为辩解。
    *   反驳和总结：再次强调同情心和理智的重要性，并批判那些虚伪的“正义”行为。

这个框架展示了内容如何从历史文化到现实社会进行论证，最终回到主题，强调真正的正义应该以同情心为基础，且绝不应以暴制暴。

希望这个总结对您有所帮助！

Attempting to justify indiscriminate acts of revenge against society is always unacceptable. No form of justice can stand in opposition to compassion. A person without compassion can never be a true hero of righteousness. Even if their actions achieve so-called macro-level contributions, their beastly nature remains unchanged. Hello everyone, I’m Huasanli. From the title and the quote, you can probably guess the reason behind this video. The review standards of several major platforms I use likely won’t allow me to create content that directly expands the influence of specific terrorist events. However, I still want to say a few words about this phenomenon itself. Today, let’s take a look at how our predecessors addressed injustice and anger when heroism was still part of the Han cultural spirit. The first article that came to my mind is Tang Ju Refuses the Mission from Strategies of the Warring States. So let’s start with that. We’ll first go through the text and then return to discuss these recent events. I’m not sure about the situation in other Chinese-speaking regions, but this story is indeed included in mainland Chinese language textbooks. It’s a dialogue between Tang Ju and the King of Qin. The story begins with Emperor Qin Shi Huang sending a message to Lord Anling, stating that Qin would like to exchange 500 li of land for the State of Anling. Lord Anling refuses, citing his duty to preserve his ancestral heritage. This displeases Qin Shi Huang, so Lord Anling sends Tang Ju as an envoy to resolve the diplomatic conflict. What follows is their conversation. Qin Shi Huang starts with aggression, saying, “I offered to exchange 500 li of land for Anling, yet Lord Anling rejected me. Why is that?” He adds, “My Qin state has annexed powerful nations like Wei and Han, yet I have not taken the mere 50 li of Anling by force. This is out of respect for Lord Anling as an elder. Now I offer ten times that—500 li—to expand his territory, yet he dares refuse me. Is he looking down on me?” Tang Ju replies, “No, it’s not like that. Lord Anling received his land from his ancestors and is bound to protect it. He would not trade it even for a thousand li, let alone just 500 li.” This reply is brilliant. The initial “No” directly rebuffs Qin Shi Huang’s aggression. Then, “It’s not like that” deflects him again, essentially saying, “You heard me right—I’m not afraid of you.” Tang Ju could have stopped after saying, “He would not trade it even for a thousand li,” which was already clear. But he adds, “Let alone just 500 li,” doubling down on his defiance. This further showcases his toughness. Naturally, the King of Qin grows furious. He abruptly changes the subject to warn Tang Ju: “Have you ever heard of the wrath of a king?” Trying to regain control of the negotiation’s rhythm. Tang Ju replies, “I have not.” The rhythm slows again. The King of Qin’s strike lands softly, like a punch in cotton. This is what’s called adaptive force, a small move countering great strength. Then the King of Qin said, "When the Son of Heaven is enraged,   corpses will float for miles, and blood will flow a thousand li."   It was a truly embarrassing display.   Boasting about one's ruthlessness is the behavior of a petty thug,   not the demeanor of a great sovereign.   Then Tang Ju, like the King of Qin, abruptly shifted the topic,   asking, "Your Majesty, have you heard of the fury of a commoner?"   The question was almost mocking.   The King of Qin replied, "The fury of a commoner?  
It is merely the removal of their hat and shoes,  
smashing their heads against the ground."   His words only added to his ridiculousness.   Using words like "merely" and "nothing but,"   again reflected a thug-like mentality,   unworthy of a great ruler like the King of Qin.   Tang Ju retorted, "That may be the anger of an ordinary man, but not of a scholar."   He first dismissed the King of Qin's notion of "removal of hats."   Then he escalated further:   "When Zhuan Zhu assassinated King Liao, a comet veiled the moon.   When Nie Zheng assassinated Han Kui, a white rainbow pierced the sun.   When Yao Li assassinated Qing Ji,  
a falcon struck on the palace steps."   Against a bully who postures with threats,  
you must make them feel unsafe in return.   Once they perceive a real threat to themselves, the bully falters.   Thus, Tang Ju cited three famous assassinations to terrify the King of Qin.   Each metaphor — the comet, the white rainbow, the falcon —   escalates the tension,   with the final one implying a threat inside the room.   Then Tang Ju continued:   "All three of these men were commoners.   Their restrained rage summoned signs from heaven."   At first, it seemed like he was wrapping up,   giving the King of Qin the impression he was softening his tone.   Then, suddenly, he changed direction:  
"And with me, that makes four."   Directly threatening to assassinate the King.   It was like underlining the key point, demanding full attention.   Tang Ju continued:   "If a scholar must act in anger,   two corpses will lie, blood will flow within five steps,   and the entire world will mourn in white. Today will be that day."   Saying this, he raised his sword.   He used the King of Qin’s own threats — "corpses," "blood," and "the world" — to turn the fear back on him.   This emphasized the difference between the rage of an ordinary man and that of a true scholar.   The same threats, but expressed with contrasting charisma.   The King of Qin had failed to achieve his aims,   using anger to mask his incompetence and rely on intimidation,   which is merely state-sponsored terrorism and lacks any personal dignity.   In contrast, Tang Ju embodied righteous fury —   the spirit of heroism,   ready to sacrifice himself for justice, inspiring others to resist oppression.   His anger was both courageous and motivational.   It was the mark of a true hero.   Then, true to form,   the King of Qin, acting like the cowardly bully he was,  
panicked and conceded.   With a frightened expression, he knelt and apologized:   "Sir, please sit down! Why go to such extremes? I understand now.   The Han and Wei kingdoms perished, but the tiny state of Anling survives,   all thanks to you, sir."   Now, compare this with the beginning of the dialogue:   When the King of Qin provoked Tang Ju, he countered with just two refusals,   each reply more forceful than the last.   Now, after Tang Ju’s threat, the King of Qin retreats with three refusals,   each one more submissive than the last.   He even has to bring up examples from Han and Wei to swallow his own words,   and answers the very question he originally used to provoke Tang Ju.   This paints the image of a petty thug vividly.   So, does this mean the Son of Heaven cannot be angry?   Of course, the Son of Heaven can be angry.   The people fear that the Son of Heaven might not understand anger.   King Xuan of Qi once asked Mencius,   "I have a flaw; I am fond of courage."   To this, Mencius replied:   "Great King, do not favor petty courage.   (The passage continues:) The poem says, 'When the King’s wrath is majestic,   he marshals his army to suppress the invaders,  
strengthens Zhou’s blessings,  
and brings peace to the world.’   This was the courage of King Wen.   With one burst of anger, King Wen secured peace for his people.   (Later passages omitted:) One man’s rampage across the world brought shame to King Wu,   and that was King Wu’s courage.   King Wu’s anger also brought peace to his people.   Now, Your Majesty, if your anger can bring peace to the people,   the people will only hope you embrace courage."   That is the true wrath of a sovereign.   It is not anger that forces people to tighten their belts,   nor the cause of corpses floating for miles and rivers of blood.   In the Han cultural spirit, anger is always tied to chivalry and justice.   When a commoner sees injustice and grows angry,   drawing their sword to assist, that is chivalry.   When one is oppressed and grows angry,   sacrificing their life for integrity, that too is chivalry.   When the Son of Heaven sees injustice in the world and grows angry,   using his anger to bring peace to his people,   that is also chivalry.   To cry out against injustice is human nature.   Han Yu, in his anger, wrote *The Preface to Sending Off Meng Dongye*,   stating, "Only when compelled does one speak.   In song, there is thought.   In lament, there is reflection.   All that escapes the lips as sound   is born of discontent."   Grass, wood, metal, stone, wind, and water all cry out when unbalanced, and so do humans.   In the decline of Zhou, Confucius and his disciples cried out,   and their voices carried far and wide.   Chu was a great state.   Its downfall was marked by Qu Yuan’s cries.   The rise of Qin was marked by Li Si’s cries.   In Han’s time, Sima Qian, Sima Xiangru, and Yang Xiong were masters of crying out.   However, in the Wei and Jin dynasties, despite the flourishing of exquisite literature,   its tone was light, shallow, and insubstantial.   Its diction was ornate but melancholic.   Its aspirations were decadent and unrestrained.   Their writings lacked structure and discipline.   Is it because Heaven scorned their virtue and ignored them?   Why didn’t the true masters of expression emerge?   Finally, returning to the present (Tang Dynasty):   Take Meng Dongye, Li Ao, and Zhang Ji as examples.   The voices of these three are truly excellent.   Yet, we cannot predict how Heaven will respond to their cries.   Will their works reflect a prosperous nation?   Or will they endure poverty, hunger, and sorrow,   with their works expressing their misfortunes?   The fates of these three lie in the hands of Heaven.   If they ascend in status, what should bring them joy?   Even in high positions, not forgetting to cry out against injustice is true joy.   If they descend, what should bring them sorrow?   Crying out against injustice, yet being silenced by Heaven, is the true sorrow.   You’ve likely heard of this experiment:   Five monkeys are placed in a metal cage.   A banana is hung inside.   When a monkey tries to grab the banana, scalding water is poured over them.   The monkeys scream and let go of the banana.   If another monkey tries to grab it, the scalding water is poured again.   After several attempts, the monkeys learn from the punishment.   If any monkey tries to grab the banana again,   the other monkeys will gang up and beat it mercilessly.   Eventually, beating the banana-grabber becomes a norm.   Even if some of the monkeys in the cage are replaced, none will dare grab the banana anymore.   When a manager says, "Others with high fevers and nosebleeds can still work,   why can’t you? If you can’t, then leave!"   The banana is right there.   But the monkeys choose instead to gang up on an unrelated weaker monkey and beat it.   He is, of course, aware of his anger.   And he doesn’t want to be the mediocre man who grovels and begs.   He thinks he has chosen the anger of a nobleman.   But what distinguishes a nobleman’s anger from a mediocre man’s anger is not its violence.   A nobleman’s anger defends justice and ends calamities,   not causing irrational harm or creating new disasters.   Attacking the weaker   only reveals a mix of selfishness and cowardice.   They leave behind phrases expressing their discontent and anger to justify their actions.   But the anger and justice they claim to uphold   are merely a mask for deeper fears.   When another monkey reaches for the banana,   they rush forward with the group, appearing valiant.   But even on the verge of starvation, they lack the courage to grab the banana themselves.   They neither dare to challenge the true source of their anger   nor possess the capacity to bear the weight of justice.   Some of them have a certain level of education,   enough to quote phrases like, "In an avalanche, no snowflake is innocent,"   and "Do not ask for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee and me."   They use such sayings to cloak their actions in righteousness.   But true justice should be grounded in healthy emotions and empathy.   Without even a basic sense of empathy for those who share similar struggles,   how can they claim justice? That’s mere savagery.   In their hearts, there is also "rational" calculation.   They choose to harm the powerless to create maximum damage   and thus vent their dissatisfaction.   Their targets are often those unable to fight back   because only then can their fantasy of "revenge" be fulfilled.   But when it comes to retaliating against the actual source of their anger,   they find it "too troublesome" and won’t bother.   Indeed, "too troublesome" and "I don’t want to" can serve as excuses for cowardice for life—   even up to the moment of their death.   This behavior—   shouting about justice but acting out of rage—   is not even as dignified as the anger of a mediocre man.   When faced with injustice, they lose even basic judgment.   These incidents are merely outbursts of cowardly, twisted personalities,   fundamentally rooted in deep self-fear.   They dare not confront themselves,   nor challenge their anger,   because they lack courage, reason, and compassion.   Such behavior is disgraceful.   And yet, to justify their disgraceful actions,   they fabricate charges against the powerless innocents they target.   They quote, "In an avalanche, no snowflake is innocent," to claim a sliver of legitimacy.   But if they insist on such misquoting,   I happen to have a few quotes of my own.   One goes, "Revenge by theft leads to greater harm for humanity."   Another says, "When laws apply only to the poor and not the rich, the world rebels."   But this last one fits best:   "Stealing mud from a swallow’s mouth, slicing iron from a needle’s tip,   scraping gold from a Buddha’s face,   seeking what does not exist,   hunting peas in a quail’s crop,   cutting flesh from an egret’s legs,   extracting oil from a mosquito’s belly—   what audacity this elder shows!"
