Which dynasty was the "Spring and Autumn and Warring States"? Why is the Spring and Autumn Period called the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period? Why is it called the Warring States Period? Hello everyone, today we are going to talk about the "Spring and Autumn and Warring States Period". This is an important era in Chinese history. Many people often refer to it together as "Spring and Autumn and Warring States", but which dynasty does it belong to? Why is the Spring and Autumn Period called the Spring and Autumn Period and why is it called the Warring States Period? Today we will go back to more than two thousand years ago with these questions to see what happened in the Eastern Zhou and Western Zhou Dynasties. : The rise and decline of the Zhou Dynasty. Many people have read "The Romance of the Gods", which tells the story of King Wu of Zhou who destroyed King Zhou of the Yin and Shang Dynasties and established the Zhou Dynasty. Although this story has a mythological flavor, the Zhou Dynasty did exist for eight hundred years and became the Zhou Dynasty. The capital of the Zhou Dynasty, the longest existing dynasty in Chinese history, was originally located in Haojing, which is now Xi'an. During this period, we call it the "Western Zhou". In order to better govern the Central Plains, the Western Zhou Dynasty divided various places into vassal states. They had a close relationship with the Emperor of Zhou and were loyal to each other. As long as the Emperor was in trouble, the princes from all over the country would respond to help solve the problem. However, as time went by, the relationship between the Emperor of Zhou and the princes gradually became alienated. Many princely countries became more and more powerful, and some even became more powerful. After surpassing the Emperor of Zhou, the prestige of the Emperor of Zhou completely collapsed during the period of King You of Zhou. Because of the incident of "playing with the princes with beacon fire", the image of the Emperor of Zhou completely disappeared in the hearts of the princes. The Western Zhou Dynasty finally perished. King Ping of Zhou succeeded to the throne and moved the capital to Luoyang, entering the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. Period Eastern Zhou: The beginning of the struggle for hegemony among the princes. During the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, the status of the Emperor of Zhou was greatly reduced. The princes in various places began to become independent and self-governing. At the same time, frictions and even wars broke out among the princes to compete for land, resources and power. During this period, the Qin State Qi State gradually rose from a small border country to become a powerful state. Under the leadership of Duke Huan of Qi, Qi State became the overlord of the Spring and Autumn Period through reforms. Lu State also rose under the leadership of Confucius. Confucius not only set a moral example for Lu State, but also compiled "Spring and Autumn Period". "Chunqiu" records the events of Lu and other vassal states. Why is the Spring and Autumn Period called Spring and Autumn? Various countries, through the records of historical officials, sorted out the disputes, conflicts and interesting stories between the vassal states. Therefore, the Spring and Autumn Period also got its name. The Warring States Period arrived and shortly after the death of Confucius, civil strife broke out in Jin State, one of the overlords of the Spring and Autumn Period. Several civil strife occurred in Jin State. The aristocratic families (Han, Zhao, and Wei) finally split the Jin Kingdom into three countries through power struggle. This incident broke Zhou Li and gave a signal to other vassal states: As long as they have strength, they can stand up. So, the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn Period The pattern of the Spring and Autumn Period changed rapidly and gradually entered the "Warring States" period. The Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period were significantly different in many aspects. For example, although the wars between the Song Dynasty and the princes were frequent, they still paid attention to the "ritual system". In the Battle of Hongshui in the Chu State, Song Xianggong, in order to maintain the "ritual system", did not take the initiative to attack when the enemy troops were crossing the river. As a result, he lost his opportunity to fight. The Song State was ultimately defeated. During the Warring States Period, the way of war became more and more cruel and most typical. An example is the Battle of Changping. The Qin State not only defeated Zhao State in the battle, but also massacred 400,000 surrendered soldiers. This behavior was almost unimaginable in the Spring and Autumn Period. During the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, the economic and social changes in the Spring and Autumn Period, the common people were mostly the property and land of the princes. It also belongs to the princes and the people have almost no freedom. During the Warring States Period, many princely states began to allocate land to the people in order to stimulate the enthusiasm of the people and give them rewards after the war. This made the people begin to flock to countries with more welfare, such as Qin and Chu. Summary Although we often regard the "Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period" as a whole, there are huge differences in the political, military and social systems of the two periods. From the ritual wars of the "Spring and Autumn Period" to the bloody struggles of the "Warring States Period", the evolution of history is not only It is a struggle for power and a huge transformation of the entire social system, economy and culture. I hope everyone can have a deeper understanding of this period of history today. See you next time!
