Description:
好的，这是对您提供的内容的总结：

**核心思想概要：**

1.  **接受帮助的前提：** 
    *   能够被帮助的人是那些愿意进行自我反思的人。
    *   有些人由于恐惧或固执，拒绝探究自身，坚持自己的故事和世界观，不愿承认自己在困境中的角色。
2.  **责任的承担：**
    *   真正能被帮助的人最终会意识到，自己可能也是问题的一部分，并愿意承担责任。
    *   有些人认为承认自己是“痛苦的缔造者”是一种屈辱，难以接受。
3.  **关系中的双向责任：**
    *   在伴侣关系中，问题通常是双方共同造成的，需要双方共同审视和改变他们的互动模式。
    *   如果有一方坚持认为自己没有责任，而问题完全在对方，那么这段关系很难得到改善。
4.  **防御机制：**
    *   不愿承担责任是因为面对自我反省可能带来的不适，会威胁到已经脆弱的自尊。
    *   有些人通过自吹自擂、拒绝道歉或承认错误来建立防御机制，因为他们无法接受自己可能犯错或存在缺陷。
    *   这种防御机制使得他们无法考虑改变自己来改善情况的可能性。

**核心要点 (Core Point):**

能够获得帮助的关键在于个人愿意承担责任，并反思自己在问题中的作用。

**根本要点 (Fundamental Point):**

自我反思和承担责任是个人成长和解决问题的必要条件。

**总体框架/概念图 (Overarching Framework/Conceptual Map):**

```
      自我反思意愿 (Willingness to Look Inward)

  责任承担 (Taking Responsibility) <---->  拒绝责任 (Denying Responsibility)
             |                          |
             V                          V
  关系模式的改变 (Changing Relationship Patterns)  防御机制 (Defensive Mechanism)
             |                          |
             V                          V
    个人成长与问题解决(Personal Growth & Problem Solving)  无法获得帮助 (Inability to be helped)

```

**解释：**

*   这个框架以“自我反思的意愿”为起点，这是获得帮助的先决条件。
*   “责任承担”和“拒绝责任”形成了两个相对的路径，决定了后续发展。
*   如果选择承担责任，则可以促成“关系模式的改变”并最终实现“个人成长与问题解决”。
*   如果选择拒绝责任，则会导致“防御机制”的产生，最终“无法获得帮助”。

 The ones who can be helped are the ones who are willing to look inward. Some people will never go for help. They'll never want to be curious about themselves, often because it's scary at the deepest level. Who are saying, this is my story and I'm sticking to it. This is my worldview. I am not going to inquire about my own role in my difficulties. The people who can be helped are the people who sooner or later get to a point where they say, okay, maybe I'm making some contribution to my troubles. And if so, what is that? Responsibility. Some responsibility. For some people, it's humiliating. It's impossible to even imagine that I am the architect of some of my own misery. Many times, a couple will come for couples therapy. And if one person says, the only thing you have to do is fix the other person, you know that it's not going to work. Because any couple has learned a set of dance steps they've developed. And what you have to help the couple to do is look at their dance steps and then modify them. And it's always two ways. It's always both people contributing to difficulties in the couple, just as both people contribute to what goes right. It's the person who says, no way am I any part of the problem here. That's the person who can't really be helped by these means. It's the reason why sometimes we don't want to take responsibility because confronting what the inward perspective might show us, as you said, is really uncomfortable for a self-esteem, which is already on the floor. So I'm playing defense. I don't want to. I'm playing defense. And the defense has to be so complete. So think about the people who are so self-aggrandizing and have to tell you, with every sentence, how wonderful they are, who can never apologize, who can never admit doing anything wrong. Those are often the people who feel the most vulnerable and who put up this rigid defense because to entertain that they're fallible, that they can make a mistake, that they can do something wrong, threatens a total collapse of the self. And so those many times are the people who just can't at all entertain that question of, what could I be doing that I might be able to change to make things better?
