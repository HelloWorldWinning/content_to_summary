the race for AI Supremacy has Reed New Heights with the introduction of Gemini 2.0 by Google this next Generation AI system is not just a competitor to open AI cgb it's a game changer Google Deep Mind has unveiled Gemini 2.0 Flash the first model in the Gemini 2.0 family designed for low latency and enhanced performance the experimental release pushes AI boundaries with features like multimodel input and output native tool usage and realtime applications through the multimodel live API developers can access it via Google AI studio with Early Access to text to speech and Native image generation so key projects demonstrate Gemini's 2.0's capabilities first one is Project estra an AI assistant with improved multilingual dialogue memory and real time understanding so here is the demo video by Google Live what can you tell me about the sculpture the sculpture you're seeing is called my world and your world by Eva Rothchild located in lwis Cubit Park in London what kind of themes does her work explore she creates abstract sculptures that invite viewers to interact with and interpret their surroundings in new ways project Astra is multilingual using native audio to seamlessly switch languages as you speak and the second one is Project Marin a prototype enabling complex browser task wi AI enhancing human agent interaction so here is a demo video by Google project Mariner with agents that can complete tasks on your behalf you can ask it to do things like this that require multiple steps doing research to look up the artist then finding the painting and then shopping for the right supplies the agent uses the web to take action and find what you're looking for it plans and reasons at each step always staying in your control and completing your task Gemini 2.0 also extends into gaming and Robotics showcasing application in realtime game suggestions and physical world problem solving so here is the demo video by Google Gemini 2.0 enables agents that can be applied across domains we're exploring agents that can explore Virtual Worlds assisting you in video games where do you recommend I attack from on this base given the base layout I recommend attacking from the bottom or Southside this direction allows you to Target the town hall directly with your Giants while the Wizards can handle the surrounding defenses Gemini 2.0 can reason about the physical world understanding 3D spatial environments and objects these capabilities are being applied to robotics with agents that can assist you in your everyday physical environment let's talk about safety

Innovative and secure so Google Gemini 2.0 marks a pivotal moment in a Paving the way for new ation while setting high standard for safety and ethical AI development so before we move forward unlock the future of AI with Comprehensive program in collaboration with en ICT Academy IAT guari in just a few months you will Master Cutting Edge skills in generative AI large language models and machine learning from learning tools like CH G and D 2 to gaining hands-on experience with python and tensor flow this course will equip you to lead AI projects and qualify for top rules like machine learning engineer or data scientist plus with an IIT certificate on your resume you will stand out to the best Employers in Tech so don't forget to check out the co link from the description box below and the pin comand so without any further Ado let's get started so welcome to the demo part of this Google Gemini 2.0 so you can access 2.0 using Google a studio so these are some models 1.5 1.5 flash flash
