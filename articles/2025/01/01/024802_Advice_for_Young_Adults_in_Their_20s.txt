and you have a lot of young people here that would all like to be you um what advice would you give them from your you know looking back at your 20-year-old self I think the important thing is that you you have the life that you want to have how you define success uh is important I I I I I don't think that there's a right path for success I think that I was lucky in that I fell in love with a game that if I played the game I ended up making a lot of money I don't recommend just going after life that way to make a lot of money I don't think I would have been happy if that was my goal to know your nature right and then to then go down paths and discover and then don't hesitate to change because you're on a journey of matching your nature to with the path that's going to be appropriate for you and then consider success in the in the broader sense of it is it bringing you the happiness I call it you know self-sufficient plus I don't care how much money you make how much status you you make all all of that uh what I care about mostly are are you happy and satisfied and I would say the most important things are meaningful work do you love your work and meaningful relationships
