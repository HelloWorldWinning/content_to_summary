Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Core Idea:**  Becoming "smart" is achievable through practical application of knowledge, not just formal schooling.
2.  **Reading:** Focus on reading non-fiction to gain knowledge, aiming to use it in conversation without being condescending. Learn useful skills from the books you read
3.  **Practice:** Actively apply what you learn (e.g. practice a skill immediately after reading about it). If thatâ€™s not possible, imagine the scenario where you'll need it.
4.  **Learning Methods:** Textbooks are efficient for learning due to their focused information and practice questions. Simulating real-world application of knowledge, through questions, is key for remembering it.

**Core Point:** Learning becomes effective when actively applied, making information relevant to your brain.

**Fundamental Point:**  Intelligence is not about innate ability but about how you use the information you acquire.

so you want to become smart in most of the world you're told that it takes 12 years of school plus 4 years of college plus 6 years of graduate school to become smart but what you actually become is homeless that's not even a joke but on the bright side when you make a Reddit post about how you can't get a job you can do it in perfect English if you haven't guessed by the title becoming smart is actually very easy even if you think your genetics make you dumb if you compare yourself to every other animal you're actually pretty over powered when people like you and me say we want to get smarter it means a bunch of things we want to learn useful skills ideally skills that make money we want to be good at solving problems hopefully for money we want to get better geds and learn difficult subjects to make more money and also to flex on people and lastly we want to sound smart in conversation just enough so people respect you but not too much to the point where people think you're a nerd the problem is most advice on the Internet is so vague and philosophical that even if it works the only people who could actually follow it are Oprah and Socrates and if you instead look for specific advice that you can actually try right now this is what you get eat blueberries cuz they brain food drink black coffee exercise sleep more take IQ tests listen to classical music these things sound good but at some point you have to you know actually learn stuff besides even in the past there have been some Geniuses who have spent the whole day sitting at a desk desk getting 2 to 4 hours of sleep a day so what can you actually do to get smarter that's not just the same six brain hacks from a Facebook post copied and pasted from a Wiki how article inspired by a quote spray painted on a New York Subway wall the main thing you need to do is read what kind of reading it depends fiction is good for learning to read faster and it gives you a better vocabulary also if you read a lot of dialogue it makes you feel like you have friends but most people go straight for non-fiction which indeed is the key to being able to casually drop interesting knowledge in conversations for example just by reading this book you can come off to anyone in conversation as someone who knows history the key is to not be obnoxious about it crazy how we evolved from chimpanzees right well actually evolution is nonlinear and several human like species inhabited Earth simultaneously none of which could even be remotely considered as chimpanzees while this is considered polite by the standards of a YouTube comment section in real life saying well actually before proving someone wrong will make you instantly unlikable change the well to an easy and now we're talking let's redo that conversation crazy how we evolved from chimpanzees right it is crazy right you know I was reading the other day and apparently humans and chimpanzees I always thought we evolved from them but I guess we just evolved side by side you can be smart while also being humble and also sounding like you touch grass the key is to teach people what you know without making them sound dumb this way people will actually learn from you which will make them see you as smart and respectable now how do you find these books it's actually really easy you don't have to read the same five books everyone tells you to read just think of a topic you want to learn about like cleaning now Google books about cleaning here's one that looks good usually these books cost money but if your finger slips you might accidentally end up on this website and you might accidentally search for the title of the book and by chance click on the first link and oh no accidentally downloaded a file and opened it with the appropriate ebook viewer well now that you have the book you'll also find that not only can you pick out interesting tidbits to use in conversations but you can also learn many useful skills there are 10 things you should know before you learn a skill one unless you practice the skill your brain will think it's useless and forget it two you only have have to know 20% of the knowledge to master 80% of the skill so I guess we could just move on this is called the learning curve it's a graph of how good you get at a skill over time as you can see just by practicing a little bit you can make a lot of progress in the beginning but you have to practice no one ever learned how to tie a tie by watching how to tie a tie you only learn how to tie a tie by watching how to tie a tie while tying a tie the same applies to reading books only make you smarter if you give your brain a reason to remember the stuff in the book so once you read the chapter on cleaning a bedroom go ahead and clean a bedroom doesn't even have to be your bedroom just clean one and now you'll never forget it but let's just imagine that's something that you can't practice right now like imagine you're reading a book about cars and then you see this diagram of how to jump start a dead car with a good car ideally you'll read about it and then go practice it but not everyone has two cars lying around to practice on but you can still practice it by just imagining imagine the moment where you'll need to know how to jump start a car put yourself in the situation find a video and pretend that's your car by imagining the whole process from start to finish you just convinced your brain that you used all that information and now you'll remember it meanwhile the person who just looked at the diagram and tried to memorize it still won't know what to do if they ever had to jump start a car this is how you get smart use everything you learn and if you can imagine yourself in the moment where it'll be useful this is basically how the entire school system works you learn a piece of information and because it'll be like 15 years before you actually use it your teacher creates an imaginary situation where that information is useful that is a test an exam that has questions on that exact piece of information and if you get it wrong you fail or in South Korea you get prison time just kidding that's only if you cheat this is usually in enough to make your brain at least attempt to remember the information the only problem is once the test is over your brain says it's not useful anymore and you forget it some people think repetition or space repetition or studying in intervals or mind mapping will help them get better grades and learn faster but in reality doing practice questions will give you the most results because they simulate the actual situation in which you'll need to use what you learned if you don't have any practice questions make your own and convince yourself that the stakes are high like pretend that you're hanging off a cliff by one arm and someone's there to pull you up but only if you can name all the parts of a human cell learning information and making it seem useful to your brain is all you need to get smart and this is why textbooks are the S tier format for becoming smart as fast as possible there's no fluff no handholding no distractions just pure information and a bunch of practice questions and if you can't solve them you have to flip all the way to page XXX VV I II in the appendix to get help textbooks aren't for the Casual learner because it's not as fun as watching a YouTube video on the topic and forgetting it all an hour later but if you're ever up to the challenge there is a website you might accidentally end up on where you could accidentally download free textbooks on any subject you want but before you do that I'm collecting donations in the form of subscribes to fund the next video [Music]
