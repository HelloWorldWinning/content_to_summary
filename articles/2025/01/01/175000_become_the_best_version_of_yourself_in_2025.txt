Description:
**I. Core Ideas:**

*   **Character Assessment:** People's true character is revealed through how they handle criticism, stress, power, and their choice of partners, and even in casual activities.
*   **Strong vs. Weak Character:** Strong character is defined by the ability to take criticism, handle stress, be responsible, and take blame, while weak character is marked by defensiveness and inability to handle stress or power responsibly.
*   **Personal Weaknesses:** Individuals are often drawn to those who mirror their own internal emptiness or weaknesses, including narcissistic partners or charismatic leaders.
*  **Self-Discovery:** Discovering one's core essence and purpose involves questioning externally imposed beliefs and values, leading to a sense of certainty. 
*   **Filling the Void:**  Personal fulfillment can come from deep engagement in work or creative pursuits, and also from understanding emptiness (through meditation, and self awareness) instead of always trying to fill it.

**II. Core Conclusion (One sentence):**
True character is not a facade but revealed in response to challenges, while self-understanding is a journey of questioning external influences to reach a core sense of purpose.

**III. Fundamental Conclusion (One sentence):**
We must look beyond surface appearances to assess character and engage in self-reflection to understand our core values and purpose.

so humans are born actors and you have to kind of look behind the mask I view it as strong or weak character a strong character is a person who can take criticism who can work with other people right who can deal with stressful situations who can handle responsibility and if there something goes wrong they take I to blame for they don't look at other people there's somebody you can rely on you lean on them and there's something there to lean on you can rely on them in situations a weak character is somebody who cannot take criticism that is probably the number one characteristic the worst trait I think in people and a definite trait of of negativity is somebody who can't take any kind of criticism they're so defensive so that means they can get away with anything they can say anything they want and they there's there just like a wall of shell around them so the ability in a work situation in a relationship to um to take criticism and be able to use it constructively is an incredibly useful and Powerful trait to me that reveals strong character how people handle stress is a really good sign of their character so in a work situation people are good at faking it and and pretending that they're very strong but when it gets really stressful and there's a lot of pressure on it the mask falls off and they reveal that they can't handle it they're too weak they're reacting to everything they can't get out of the moment they're so impatient you know and fragile and so the ability to handle stress shows that somebody has something strong inside of them how they handle power so when people are kind of climbing up the ladder in in a group or in a job they generally try and pretend like they're they're they're with with the group but once they have power that all falls off and they can become abusive and they feel like they can get away with any things that they couldn't get away with before they treat people below them miserably Etc so when people have power how do they handle it are they responsible do they suddenly become somebody different or do they maintain the character that they had beforehand what kind of Partners do they choose do they choose a spouse a husband a girlfriend Etc somebody that they can push around somebody that's inferior to them so they can feel better about themselves how do they look when they're playing like a game or they're in outdoor activities or something that has nothing to do with work are they so competitive they have to win at everything even when it's like outside of that kind of environment you know these are kind of traits that help me sort of Judge a person's character yeah these are often the things that we either ignore or we actually let them kind of Fall by the wayside or or don't pay enough attention to them because we think oh no but they're so smart and they're so this and what does that say about us that we often get attracted to the wrong things within people does that make us of strong or weak character I know that I tend to get involved with narcissistic people it's a weakness of mine and maybe it's because of my upbringing and maybe it's because I feel a kind of emptiness inside of me and that their charm and the attention they pretend to give you is kind of enchanting or casts a spell on you and it draws you in yes so if you're dealing with your own weaknesses and your own emptiness inside you're going to be drawn to people who fill that up are you're going to be drawn to causes and charismatic leaders that pretend to give you a purpose in your life because you don't have a purpose but they have it for you kind of thing so a lot of it has to do yeah with ourselves we're even attracted to negative people and U there are people who have patterns in their life where they deliberately choose the worst kind of person for them over and over and over again because at least that makes them feel alive at least the pain of it you know gives them a sense of Something's Happ something dramatic and so they deliberately bring on that kind of pain so it it's complicated yeah yeah when you said that often we feel an emptiness inside and you were saying maybe because of your upbringing you felt that emptiness inside as well have you tried to fill that emptiness or is there another solution well uh to me uh it's why I wrote the book Mastery the way I feel my emptiness and have I've done it for since I was a kid is through my work and through my ideas and my thinking and how I'm constantly looking for new thoughts and new ways of looking at the world some people think of work as something that you just have to do it's just a way to get money but for me it's a way to to feel like I'm I'm a human being that I am who I am I was destined to to write these books and it gives me every day I wake up and I know this is what I need to accomplish etc etc that's why I read so many books that's why I'm so intrigued by ideas that's why I'm writing a book right now about a subject that very much captivates me because it does feel that inner kind of emptiness but on the other hand as someone who meditates there is a purpose to emptiness it's not necessarily good to be always having to fill things up in your brain like you're just pouring food into your system you know there is something actually kind of intrinsically beautiful about the idea that there is emptiness that I don't really have a self that there is actually not that there is no such thing as a mind actually it's it's an illusion that we create it's something it's a lang something through words that we have so that sense of emptiness that you know I'm I don't have an ego or that I'm confronting the world and I'm just hearing and seeing things as they are is actually a beautiful thing so you have to I have to kind of struggle against this idea of always to fill myself up who really are you in the end you know what what what constitutes you the essence of you what were you meant to accomplish in this world right your sense of purpose you know to use the title of your show what is it that makes you an individual makes you unique that you alone are meant to accomplish in life well it's not given we don't know it and a lot of people really really struggle with trying to figure that out right because they've been programmed by their parents by their siblings by the culture by their teachers to say this is who you are this is what you should believe in this is what you were meant to accomplish in life this is what's cool and what's not cool and so you have to question yourself you have to say is this really who I am am I really interested in this subject am I really interested in this kind of person in getting in a relationship with this kind of person and so question yourself on that level you're getting at a deeper and deeper core of maybe who you are at Essence you're cutting away all of the social stuff that's been foed upon you that it has nothing to do with you right so in some ways you're kind of a mystery to yourself and you're sort of trying to solve that puzzle and you have to ask these questions is this something I'm actually really interested in is this an intrinsically important thing to me or is it something that's in the culture or something that other people have told me and questioning that over and over and over again is not to lead you into to this Abyss where there's nothing real is to get you closer to who you are to what really matters to what that essence of you is to what you meant to accomplish in life and once you reach that that inner kind of gold then you have you have a degree of certainty MH so I know I knew from a very young age that I wanted to be a writer I had a struggle to figure out what kind of writing I wanted but knowing that's who I am probably about at the age of eight it allowed me to go I'm not interested in that I don't want to do that this is an important important why am I following this career path why am I wasting my time here so knowing that kind of core you don't have to keep questioning yourself so I'm never going to question myself why are you a writer why are you writing books you should have been a a pop star you should have been a rock singer you should have written poetry you should have been a lawyer no I'll never go there because I have that that firm ground beneath me and that's what your questioning is supposed to lead to get to the essence of who you are and once you're there you have a degree of certainty in your life
