**核心要点总结:**

1.  **反思错误的学习方式：**
    *   **反阅读数量:**  学习不是积累阅读量，而是追求将知识吸收并运用。
    *   **反速成干货:**  依赖快速知识产品，导致理解不深入，记忆不牢固。
    *   **反复制粘贴:**  简单复制知识点，缺乏大脑加工，无法真正吸收。

2.  **正确的学习方式：**
    *   **精细加工：** 用自己的话表达理解，进行问题解决式思考。
    *   **链接旧知：** 将新知识与旧知识建立联系，形成知识网络。
    *   **知识管理：**  使用NKP知识管理系统（收集信息，记录概念，整合主题，实践反馈）。

3.  **核心结论:**  真正的学习在于深入理解、关联旧知并加以应用，而不是盲目追求数量或速成。

4.  **根本结论:**  有效的学习需要精细加工知识，构建知识网络，并将其转化为实际应用。

I used to be obsessed with the goal of how many books I read per year I like to talk about numbers 3 hours yesterday Read 50 books this year It seems that the amount of knowledge will increase with the amount of reading Later, I was interested in reading a book in a few minutes Think concentrated is the essence I bought a bunch of dry goods neatly in the favorites And then they just sit there eating ashes just know now Use these methods to improve yourself is the biggest mistake in learning hello everyone Welcome back to Heart River Ferry Today we talk about how to truly learn And how to create a learning system that benefits lifelong first counter read Blindly flaunt the number of readings I read 100 books a year You read 50 books a year I must have learned more than you Certainly not Because different books have different reading difficulties Read a popular science book in a week A professional academic work maybe the first half of the year But the harvest of the two is simply the difference between cloud and mud Learning is not about accumulating the number of readings What we pursue is in the process of reading How much knowledge is put into the brain and used it for me However, this purpose is not quantifiable It is easy for us to regard the means of accumulating quantities as as the purpose of learning Once in the counter trap you'll find yourself caring Numerical values ​​that flow on the surface Need to read 200 pages today turn over faster this book is thinner then read this Gain knowledge by cramming Mixed noodles at most Can't really absorb and digest Naturally, the purpose of learning cannot be achieved the second Pursue quick success and dry goods Add buffs with various auxiliary tools I just found out that if I want to read a book Almost no need to buy to watch slowly A lot of open book notes on the Internet mind Mapping Refining don't want to read text If you can find pictures Videos like dismantling a book in 10 minutes In short A difficult process that would have taken a week or two It's done in a few minutes now The reason why I have been poisoned by these knowledge products for a long time The reason is lazy I don't want to get up early on weekends I don’t want to give up the time spent watching dramas and playing games I prefer to spend tens of dollars to buy a membership Comforting myself with the scraps of knowledge crushed by others certainly Their role is only self-comfort In terms of content comprehension and memory firmness It's not as good as reading a book by yourself Because the pace of reading and obtaining information is slow Answer the questions in the reading by flipping through the process Helps the brain form a complete mind map Also text is abstract The brain needs to visualize them In order to better understand and remember The third copy and paste without thinking Simple machining for knowledge It's a habit I developed when I was in school When you come across some good knowledge points, copy them into your notes It is now more convenient to read e-books on mobile phones Copy and paste directly This method cannot be said to be completely useless can only say insignificant Because I only acted as a porter of knowledge without brain processing Psychology processes and stores information in two ways Fine Processing and Machining The former has to be chewed and thought about Connect with the original knowledge reserve of the brain The latter is simply copy-paste like in excel Copy data from one table to another Doing so will give you a sense of familiarity give the illusion that i've learned but for the brain The data has not undergone any processing Remains only briefly in short-term memory Here are two fine-tuning practices First, on the basis of understanding express it in your own words Also known as the Feynman learning method Second, set yourself a question Then use the thinking of solving the problem to answer carry out these two processes You have to find a way to make the fragmented knowledge form a complete logical structure encoding of knowledge This is an important step in learning There is an example in the book Open Mind Let's look at this passage first The trolley problem is essentially a moral philosophy The collision of deontology and teleology its result is not very important What matters is the decision-making process and value orientation However, this problem has been The moral dual-processing model basically solves You see, this passage mentions a lot of concepts Maybe everyone knows the trolley problem But the deontological teleological moral dual process model these we are dumbfounded If you do not know these concepts We have no way of gaining knowledge from this information However, when we have these concepts in our original knowledge reserve deontological teleology knowledge network The information is then internalized into our new knowledge effective learning The acquisition of any knowledge is like this We turn what we don't know into knowing The point is that old knowledge acts as a signpost Guide new knowledge to a specific location and connect with old knowledge Form a new knowledge network That is, new information must be linked to old knowledge to be stored and understood by the brain Otherwise it's like an isolated island will be submerged at any time We can use dikw model to understand the process It represents the four levels of knowledge management Respectively date data information information knowledge and wisdom For example, the concept of Excel if i never learned computer then it is a data to me i don't know what it means I don't even know what it is for but when i know It is a spreadsheet that can handle grid office software it is no longer 5 characters of data my brain would go to something like a wrench pliers and associate it with work If I don't understand only what Excel means Learned the principles of operation Then it's not just a dot in the brain but a chart containing Knowledge network of function shortcut keys and other information That's when my perspective was elevated. It's like seeing houses, cars and people on the ground from an airplane and the roads that connect them Finally when I was at work Ability to abstract practical problems out of basic models And use the Excel Knowledge Network to explain and process rose to the level of wisdom To put it bluntly, it is a good transfer of application knowledge This is also the ultimate purpose of learning after school It is difficult to study systematically like in school Most of the information we receive is fragmented There is no way to connect them well So an efficient learning system Must be able to fragment information integrated into a complete logical structure and apply it to real life Here I share with you a set called NKP's knowledge management system it's actually really easy 4 pages of notes You can imagine it as 4 folders The first collection folder in box when studying a field information acquired and ideas generated concepts of interest Improve through active learning Then put them into the concept folder note After accumulating a certain amount of concepts You can find that there is a certain relationship between certain concepts logical association Pick out these concepts Integrate into theme folder The knowledge in the knowledge folder have formed a complete structure The fourth project folder project It is the experience formed in the practical application and feedback results so it's a bit abstract Let's give an example For example, if you are interested in the topic of sleep you will check some information The information is in the collection folder then you find The literature often mentions professional rhythmic sleep cycles fast sleep trigger Sleep Type R90 Scheme Melatonin Clayderman Montmartre Cave concepts such as experiments Since it appears frequently, it must be important So you checked the relevant information Put them into the concepts folder Wait until more and more information you find a certain connection between them like a full sleep cycle Including fast sleep and non fast sleep This is also the rhythm Control people's work and rest 24 hours a day His duration was first described by Professor Clayderman Locked up in the caves of Montmartre for 32 days These concepts are linked together can be integrated into the theme folder This integration approach is bottom-up through the logical combination of concepts form different themes Another method is top-down Just ask questions in the topic question folder first Then retrieve from the concept folder problem-solving concepts For example, what is the process of sleep? sleep cycle in concept folder The concept of quickly inducing sleep is brought out combine it The sleep process is composed of 4-5 sleep cycles Each sleep cycle is about 90 minutes The last thing is to apply With the previous complete sleep knowledge network We know the dangers of staying up late Your own sleep type can also be based on Develop a reasonable sleep plan for your own actual situation These practical experience and feedback can be further refined to the theme folder Repeat this process several times sleep in your brain It's not as simple as closing and opening the eyes but a complete web of knowledge And you can stand high and look down To achieve the purpose of knowledge for your use Collect information from record concept to integrate into topics and practical applications Information is fluid in the IMKP system You will continue to call processing, reorganization and perfection Every step needs to be processed by the brain Efficient encoding and retrieval of knowledge than before we read repeatedly It is much better to focus on the excerpt Finally, let's summarize the three misunderstandings of learning Contact Myopia Reading Pursue Crash and Dry Goods copy and paste not thinking about the essence of what is really learned New knowledge guided by old knowledge store and connect with old knowledge in the brain Form a new knowledge network To achieve systematic learning, you can use the NKP learning system it's actually really easy can be summed up in a few words Gathering InfoRecordingConceptsIntegratingTopicsApp Feedback Let knowledge flow in the system and lead our actual actions Okay, that's it for this issue I hope everyone can learn efficiently Learn more easily like playing
