Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Core Idea:**

*   **Challenge:** Stock market forecasting is inherently difficult due to its complex and unpredictable nature.
*   **Solution:** Deep Learning (DL) models offer potential for improving prediction accuracy and reducing investment risk.
*   **Focus:** This review investigates the use of DL models with technical analysis for stock market forecasting.
*   **Key Aspects:** The review examines predictor techniques, trading strategies, profitability metrics, and risk management in studies using DL.

**II. Key Findings:**

*   **LSTM Dominance:** The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is the most prevalent DL technique used for stock market forecasting (73.5%).
*   **Profitability Gap:** A significant limitation in the literature is the lack of focus on profitability metrics (only 35.3% of studies).
*   **Risk Neglect:**  Risk management is severely underrepresented, with only two studies incorporating it.

**III. Conclusion:**

*   **Core Point:** Deep Learning, especially LSTM, shows promise for stock market forecasting, but research needs greater emphasis on practical validation.
*   **Fundamental Point:** While DL techniques are widely applied, further research is necessary to address the crucial gaps in profitability assessment and risk management, making it more relevant to the real financial market.

**IV. Overarching Framework:**

The content presents an overview of the existing research on Deep Learning models for stock market forecasting, highlighting its potential, and the critical gaps that need to be addressed. The framework centers on evaluating the application of DL techniques, specifically through the lens of technical analysis, with an eye toward practical application rather than solely model performance.

Content:
Stock market forecasting is one of the biggest challenges in the financial market since its time series has a complex, noisy, chaotic, dynamic, volatile, and non-parametric nature. However, due to computing development, an intelligent model can help investors and professional analysts reduce the risk of their investments. As Deep Learning models have been extensively studied in recent years, several studies have explored these techniques to predict stock prices using historical data and technical indicators. However, as the objective is to generate forecasts for the financial market, it is essential to validate the model through profitability metrics and model performance. Therefore, this systematic review focuses on Deep Learning models implemented for stock market forecasting using technical analysis. Discussions were made based on four main points of view: predictor techniques, trading strategies, profitability metrics, and risk management. This study showed that the LSTM technique is widely applied in this scenario (73.5%). This work significant contribution is to highlight some limitations found in the literature, such as only 35.3% of the studies analysed profitability, and only two articles implemented risk management. Therefore, despite the widely explored theme, there are still interesting open areas for research and development.
