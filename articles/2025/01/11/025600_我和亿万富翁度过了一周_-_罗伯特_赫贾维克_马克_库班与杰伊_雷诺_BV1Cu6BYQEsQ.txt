Description:
Okay, here's a structured summary of the content, followed by the conceptual map:

**Summary:**

1.  **Shark Tank US Insights:**
    *   Filming days are long (12 hours) and involve many pitches (10+).
    *   The quality of entrepreneurs and businesses is high.
    *   Being on the show can significantly boost sales.
    *   Advertising slots are very expensive, making pitching valuable.
    *   The show is much larger than Shark Tank Australia.

2.  **Cybersecurity & AI Discussion:**
    *   Cybersecurity is cyclical with constant room for innovation.
    *   Hackers innovate faster than the industry, requiring adaptation.
    *   AI will be integral for companies; those who adopt it effectively will be successful.
    *   AI will become ubiquitous, integrated into many aspects of life, even personal models for children.
    *   Current investment in AI resembles the early internet days, focusing on chip acquisition, but will become more efficient and enable smaller companies.
    *   There will be baseline AI models that will be customized for specific use cases.

3.  **Robert's Personality & Values:**
    *   He's generally a very happy person, valuing time and efficiency.

    *  Seek non-consensus or "margin in mystery" to find areas for innovation.
    * He prefers unfiltered information and communicates directly to the source to compile insights.
    *   Outsources responsibilities when scaled, to focus on his core skills
    *  He plays at life, enjoying expensive material possessions but not driven by it, focusing more on achieving success and squeezing every moment.
   *  Overcoming fear and mediocrity is essential for growth.
   *  Consistent failure with a consistent goal is what builds confidence.

6.  **General Life Advice (Jay & Robert):**
    *   Try different things and gain stage time (Jay)

 In this video, we'll explore what really happens behind the scenes of US Shark Tank from the pitches to off-camera moments. I'll do that deal. Then we'll dive into Jay Leno's legendary garage. I rest my care. And finally, we're off to explore Roberts insane house. Wow! So we're in sunny LA today, and we're heading to the US Shark Tank. Lucky I've got a good lift and a very nice car to head there and style. Let's do it. So what's on the plans today? Filming. How long have you gone for? We'll be here to late. Yeah. Well, 12 hours. How many pitches do you get through? We'll do at least 10. Yeah. Very different to the Australian one. I'm so curious to see how you guys find it. What's your main tip for someone that's like going to start a new cyber security startup? I met a guy the other day who's integrating AI and he's onboarded a fair few clients. But like, is there still room in the space? Considering it's such a boring industry. The great thing about cyber is that it goes in cycles of about three years. And every three years it eats its own young. And so there's constant room and improvement. And what's hot today will change in three years. You know why? Because hackers are moving at a pace faster than the industry. And being big means nothing in cyber. One of the most interesting things about the US Shark Tank is just like the quality of entrepreneurs and businesses that come through. And they can get like a million dollars bump in sales just from going on the show. So it makes sense. But from like an ad perspective, a 30 second slot is like $300,000. It's something like that in Shark Tank. So if you extrapolate that out for actually pitching, it's crazy. Crazy value. Honestly, that just there would be Shark Tank Australia. It's about 10 times bigger. It's huge. What do you think about AI and marketing technology? Do you think like the generative AI is going to be Hapes revolutionary to a lot of your e-commerce businesses? Do you think it's going to be separate winners or like specialized use cases? There's going to be two types of companies. Those who are great at AI and everybody else. Yeah. Even a small company. You know, now kids are using chat GPT, Gemini, etc. So figure out whatever they want to figure out. So it's going to be natural. That's just the way technology works. I mean, there was a day with the Kigga for new that the other day was there. He's drinking his food and then AI was new, but then everybody just got used to it. Yeah. It's another thing. And that's where AI is going. It'll be integrated into tracking thing. And so you got to learn it. You got to use it. Do you think it'll be a bubble? No. No, no. In terms of investment, like what's happening is, just like the early days of the internet, everybody's raising money to be able to buy as many chips as they possibly can. Yeah. To design the figure and figure and you have complete modeling. But the models are becoming more efficient. You won't be as many chips, hopefully, or as much power. And I think that will influence things so that smaller companies can do things. Yeah. So do you think that's going to be smaller companies that specialized? Let's say copy. Copywriting for e-commerce will be like one LLM for years or a direct and chatting video. We'll just phone it all. I think there'll be some baseline models. Yeah. And then people will build on those and we'll all have our own model. Yeah. And if you hold you. 29. Okay. So if you have a kid today, right? Yeah. Do you have any kids? No, no. Yeah. Okay. So if you had a kid next year, by the time your kid would turn six years old. Yeah. To have its own model that you could talk to and talk back to you. Yeah. And it would learn and then you'd be able to play all the conversations with the model. Yeah. To see what your kid's up to. And then you could say, well, I want my kid to learn more about this, this, this, this. And then we'll introduce that. So not only will every business have its own model, but every first thing we'll have. Yeah. Exciting space. I'll leave you to it. Love it. Yeah. Were you always is happy? Yeah. You just seem like the first time I met you, or one of the first time you had us over at your house. And we're like, where's Robert Ayl the guest for sitting around? And you were launching a toy rocket that you bought to one of your son on the beach. And I see like, no, I'm running fast. Like you're just. You're not fast for my son. And if you just been like this, even when you're a teenager or you're grinding it out in 12 hour days in the office, no money. I'm pretty happy. 98% of the time. What makes you most unhappy? Like what are that in what situations? He's stuck talking and boring people. Oh, I start to miss shit when things are organized. I'm very detailed that way. And they're not organized? Yeah. Yeah. You know, like when somebody messes up my reservation, you know, or we could have done something faster, wasting time drives me absolutely bad. So that's the biggest thing about retiring is like, Kimmy will be like, hey, let's go both pick up the kids and have you like, well, surely split and swap. You can be doing this. Yeah. And she's like, she looks at me. Don't we want to spend time together? And I'm like, oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. But do you practice? Because I value time. So precious. I have this overarching fear of running out of time. And I want to squeeze every second. I look like everybody. Why does Jay Leno hate Ferraris? When he was a struggling comedian, was a maintenance guy, he was a mechanic. And I forget whether it was an Audi dealer or a Volkswagen dealer. He was actually, he worked there as a mechanic. And one day after work, when he was making a little bit of money, he was a very conservative guy. He's still working and was becoming a comedian. He went to a Ferrari dealership and they treated him like crap. They were like, oh, if you want that, you have to buy one of these. And he just thought they were so pretentious. And he never, never got into that. Never allowed them to rebuild the kind of situation. Ferrari doesn't need anybody. Really? Yeah. There's an echelon in the pecking order. And I was at the very top. Like, I was one of the top clients in the world. For Ferrari. For Ferrari. How many do you have? Oh, I had a lot at one point, but I had the rarest ones. Yeah. And then when I went through some difficulties, I had to sell one in my cars. That was like in the ethos of Ferrari, there was not a bigger number. No matter what situation. No. And so they kicked me out of the club. Wow. I heard my man in a chat and chill. It's all funny things. They beat up and cocked out the picture. Must be yachty. If he can make me. I'll tell my man put down the link. Hey, man. How you doing? Long time no see. Long time no see. Welcome. It's my friend, Davey from Australia. Davey, nice to meet you. Scott. Welcome. Everything here is part of the collection. Yeah, it's ready to go. This is awesome. Yeah. Yeah. I think maybe should roll around Beverly Hills in the electric jolly, huh? What do you think? Is it starting most expensive down that end? Yeah. That'd be nice. Yeah. It goes proud. What is it? Millions down to like 50 grand. Yeah. I did it. Oh, man. He's going to fit in. This is not a kit car. This is an actual car. It's a, what was the original? It was a Fiat Cinco cento. Yeah. Whatever they call it. And they would stick them on the yachts. And this was their kind of like island car. I love this car. What's this? So I've never seen this car. This is stunningly beautiful. Four-year restoration 1966 Jag XKE. Enzo Ferrari said it's the most beautiful car ever made. And it's not even a Ferrari. I mean, it is just so beautiful. I feel like this is your favorite. I've never seen it. I think I'm just excited. Oh my god. That is so sexy. I got to show you something on this car. It's incredible. This is the Cullinan. It's enormous. It's enormous. It's so big. So nice to drive. I'm getting on. You are? Yeah. What? You should get what? I'm getting one of these. I love the photos. It's even bigger than the Spectre. I'm sold. Uh, yeah. You know what? It's actually a great car to drive. It's like Jay said. What I love about these cars is their unabashedly Rolls Royce. It makes no excuses for what it is. It's luxury. It's beauty. It's solid. It's not like loud, is it? No. It's luxury. It's luxury. Oh, OK. OK. Well, yeah. Speaking of loud. Oh, wait till you hear this. So you won't know what this is because... Not your average SUV. In America, we have real cars, not like in Australia. So this is a Cadillac baby Escalade. Look how big this is. No, this is the boat. This is the boat. But it's not just a Cadillac Escalade. They made a special edition, the D version, with a Corvette engine in it. In America, there's no such thing as too much power. So picking up the kids, you're running late, they're going to charge you extra for, you know, daycare. You got to go. You need to go fast. Isn't that sick? I did not expect that. And then boom. The monster. This is what we've been waiting for. I bought this car a few years ago. I actually had to meet with Lamborghini to talk about the car and sign up for it. It's the 50th anniversary Lamborghini Kuntage. They only made 50 of them. It was 2.8. I think the wind is right around there. How many other cars do you have that aren't just here? A few. This is so nice. I've never seen this. It's so beautiful. Started up, Davey. It is quite deep, isn't it? Yeah, I know. It's got a good. I'm going to get out of the way in case he runs me over. So sexy. Wow. Very cool. Very happy with it. All right. Well, I think this is the highest performance car here. Davey, let's take it for a spin. Stop. All right. Good to go. What do you think? It's nice. It's just jolty. What because we're going too slow? Yeah. We're going 16 miles an hour. It doesn't know what gear to go in. Like, his first year will go like to probably 50 miles. Yeah. What was the first car you ever bought? Like your first ever good car? 1987 Mazda RX7. And the ugliest gold color you can imagine. Take it. Try it. So nice. Hear that. Yeah. So nice. If they could, they'd probably shoot. Oh, yeah. I left the hood. I said I would. I left the hood. I said I would. So Jay, I'm surrounded by so many beautiful cars. And I assume when you're a kid, Craig, me if I'm wrong, that this is your vision of success. Just being able to work on your cars every single day. Yeah, I think so. You know, I was always happy whatever level I was in my life. So it wasn't like it was, oh, I have to have this. You know, I started doing comedy, just making enough money to eat and pay my rent. Well, I was on top of the world. You know, I meet other people that get so obsessed and I should be doing this. I should be the boss. And I should be the, no, I was, I was just always happy whatever level I was. And I think that's part of the key to success. Because people sense that when you're like, oh, this guy wants a little too much, you know what I mean? So, but if you're having fun and you enjoy yourself, then people want to help you and do more. Oh, I like this. I want to want to keep you happy. So you know what I mean? If that doesn't make any sense at all. Yeah, it does. Do you have advice for some and like a young kid maybe that's trying to find their polarity or their brand or their voice? You mean the job isn't it? Yeah, just to ensure you don't. Well, what I would always tell people is try and get up on stage. Don't try and be a comedian or whatever. Just like being MC the talent show. Hey, my next guest is on. So if you say something funny, it gets a laugh. Oh, okay. Try another job. It doesn't go. Okay. Our next guy, you know, I mean, don't, if you say you're a comedian, right away, people are like, this thing will only make you, yeah, exactly. But if you present yourself just a moment near the MC, then they're going, that guy was as funny as the comics. Yeah. He's not a comic. Yeah. So I think that try to get as much stage time as you can. It's in church. It could be a synagogue. Could be a, you know, labor meeting a friend of mine to do a drug about it. He joined AA just to get the stage time. Hey, I've been an alcoholic, you know. So yeah. I'd love to learn a little bit more about the business of investing into cars. And I think you're investing watches as well, right? Yeah. How do you see investing in cars? Is it business? Is it passion? It costs just as much to restore a worthless car as it does a valuable car. So if you start with something valuable, it'll be worth more. You know, you get some worth because it's all labor, you know. Most cars are built, especially older cars when technology was expensive and labor was cheap. Now it's the flip side. So you want to buy the best car you can and then put whatever after you have to into it. What kind of, what kind of, are you all like, like rub it or? Well, Rolex is fine. I like some of the more obscure brands. You know, the one, there's some really good watches coming out of Germany. I was a little town called Glasuta in Germany, where all watches are made. And Long and Zong are there. Glasuta original there. And these are brands that are challenging, particularly in all the other big ones. So, and they've gone up in value. But here's the thing, if you're knowledgeable about your subject and you buy things about that subject, the fact that you like them means other knowledgeable people who like them too. So they'll probably go up in value. I mean, I, offs collect like those land beginning mirrors. I, offs thought they were great, even when they were worthless, because they were unique and they were, it was a new kind of design and, you know, were to catch on. We didn't really know, but I thought it would. And then, of course, I got the yellow ones are free and now it's worth two, three million dollars. Yeah. And I've heard you said that you're dyslexic. How did that disadvantage you? And what kind of advice would you have for entrepreneurs that are hanging onto those disadvantages and not letting them? Here was the cure over dyslexium. I was a kid. Smart enough. Smart enough. Smart enough. I'm smart. I'm smart. I got it now. I'm smart. I'm smart. Say you're hard on yourself. Yeah. I think you have to be. Like I say, I'm always a believer in you. You believe in low self-esteem. If you don't think you're the smartest person in the room, you shut up and you listen to people. You know, if you have a product that you invented, that means you're an inventor. You're not an entrepreneur. An entrepreneur or someone who knows how to sell your product. So find someone who can do what you can't do and put them to work, you know? That just seems like common sense to me. Yeah, you seem very frugal with money. I'm a scholar. My mother's with Scotland. I'm a greener. So have you tried to address that? Or do you think it makes you happy being like that? Because I'm probably on the opposite side. I'm spending a little bit more money than I. I rest my case. If you live within your means, you'll always be happy. You'll always be fine. You know, I always meet people like, go, what? Why did they buy that? I mean, it doesn't make any sense, you know? So, yeah, I probably come from having a Scottish mother. My mother's in Scotland. When I got to the Tonight Show, it was the Tonight Show starring Jay Leno. And my mother, oh, starred in Jay Leno. And I said, he shot, starred. I go, wow, that's what they do. You know, but starred in... You got your name all over the show already. You got to have starred in Jay Leno. And you know, this went on for weeks, you know? To find that call, I'm pretty excited. Look, take that off. Make it to the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Just take starring off. And they were like, why? My mother's driving me crazy. So, the Tonight Show went into my mother. Oh, that's much better. Now, people are not going to think of Mr. Who's Who. But, you know, it really is true. When people would say, oh, I don't know why I like you, but I like you. A little, there's a number of reasons why. Maybe you're not pushing yourself in front of them all the time. Maybe you're not selling a product you don't really believe in. You know, maybe you're just saying with Jay Leno instead of starring. Because what do I do with this star? I don't sing, I don't dance. So, just make it with Jay Leno. Well, you're incredibly modest. Well, appreciate it. Well, thank you, mate. Thanks for having me. We've got a little bit of a gift for Robert. We've got a gift for you. You do? Yeah. What do you got? Showing us such a good time. So a lot of people ask me what you like, on camera. And you're generally one of the nicest people. Charly can attest to that as well. You've shown us around LA, you're so very generous. You have the time to get your gift. around LA, you're so very generous here for time, so we're going to get you a gift. Oh, it's a bag, an empty bag. How nice of you. Oh, thank you. Hope you like it. Should I open it? I know you're a Rolex man. Do you unwrap gifts violently? Yeah, violence. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know you're a Rolex man, but we want to start your protect collection. No, you didn't. Oh, my. So, for context, Robert has about $75.00 and no, you're a petex. So, we want to start entry level color travel. Wow, you got me a pet tag. We appreciate everything that you do for Shark Tank. Oh, I should have been nice for you. Very nice. Oh, my God. I don't know what to say, man. Very nice of you. Thank you. I appreciate it. It's so beautiful. Oh, my God. That's amazing. Oh, my God. I'm still like, we got him stageless. That was so nice of you, man. Even the people that we met this trip was once in a lifetime trip. So super appreciate it. It's a beautiful boat. What's this? This is a wire. Yeah, W. A. J. A. R. Stunning. Don't step on this, David, because you can fall in. One question I had is after I made a couple of bad business moves, one thing that I found is I started to get paralysis around decisions. Now, your business is obviously enormous and we're in the roles the other day and you're talking about how the reason why you become so big is because you made so many big bets, so many big moves in the space to keep hitting those sales trajectories. What's your kind of mentality around big bets and how do you make sure that you don't lose it all? People overthink it. A big bet is the culmination of little successes or the avoidance of little failures. That's what everybody who doesn't have a business thinks. They think you stand the edge of a cliff. You look down and you just jump off, right? Make a big bet. I always say, why not walk down the water, see how deep it is. So I tend to move quickly, fail fast or succeed fast and then double it down. Yeah, right? So if I'm investing 10 grand in works, 20 grand, 100 grand, a million. Yeah. How do you do it? I think, yeah, generally what I'm trying to do at the moment is actually test the concept by myself with high involvement and then put someone really good in the position. But I think it's when you're quite young, you haven't seen enough of the world, right? You haven't made a lot of these failures yet. So that's something that I realized, when I first started, you know, I was hit after hit after hit and I couldn't fail. I had the framework and then I was like, lost after lost after lost. And it was kind of like, what am I doing wrong? And I think it was because one, I was going into new and explored territories where there was just no previous learnings, but two, I just didn't have the right people to support me after proving it. So I think it's a much of a people issue rather than a concept issue. Oh, but that's for the execution of it after you've made the bet. Here's another thing I've learned along the way, which was a big shock for me. When I was trying to make a big bet, I would go into a room with my team and make sure I had complete consensus. Hey guys, we're running into this field. What do you all think? What I learned though is if you walk into a room and everybody else knows the answer and it's self-evident, it's probably too late. Yeah. Like to make a big bet to really change course, it's usually something people haven't realized. You're trying to find there's margin in the non consensus, right? There's margin in mystery. Yeah, it's good. One interesting contrast that I've seen is how many emails you do. Like how many emails do you do a day? Do you even know what email is? No, I just use Instagram. Yeah. Seriously? No. Yeah. Ah, 200, 250. That's absurd amount of like management, I guess. Like is that just industry specific or is that just your level of intensity that you've always operated up in terms of like micro managing? Yeah, everybody's different. I tend to go to the source when I don't understand something. I don't want you to tell me about it. I want the guy or the girl actually doing the job telling me about it. Yeah. So I've always been a complete open door, but I want to know like I got a no for myself. So I send a lot of emails about what's going on. If there's an issue with a customer, I want to know from the engineer at the customer site. I don't want filtered information. I want raw data so I can compile it and make a decision on it. Across all of the departments. All the departments. Yeah, it makes sense. And I find that you outsource the responsibility of the things that you're least proficient in. And that's probably the thing that you should be focused mainly on. You got to start. You got to get good at everything great at your skill set. And when you get to a little bit of scale, then you hire an outsourced a CFO, a CRO, a CMO, whatever. One other really frame breaking thing was you're the happiest person that I think I've ever met, but you love materialistic possessions. I do. And a lot of people, they chase materialistic possessions and that drives them into unhappiness. But you seem to be extremely content in the chaos in the 200 emails a day. How do you see happiness and the relation to materialistic products? These are great questions. I've done a million interviews. No one's ever asked me that, you know, here's a funny thing. You know me pretty well now. People that know me really well. No, I'm not driven by money at all. Like at all in the least, I love to play. I love this boat. I love the fact this boat was a million and half dollars. I love the fact that I had it built for me. I love jets. I love cars. I love watches. I love the watch you got me. I love to play at life, but I don't wake up in the morning. Oh, I need another Rolex and he another jet. I'm driven by success. Like I just want to be the best I can be. I want to squeeze every second out of every moment in life. And I kind of feel like stuff will come out of it. I love that. Does raw achievement give you confidence just stacking up undeniable proof? Doing it over and over and failing constant failure with a consistent goal gives you confidence. So I couldn't speak to people. I did a speech completely messed it up. I did it again. I was a little work. I was a little better, but I just got to a point in my life where the pain of how I was living was greater than my need for mediocrity and was greater than my fear. That's it. Like, you know, I always say to people, you're either you're either going to accept your situation in life and bitch and complain for the rest of your life or you're just going to get over it and you're going to go do it. Like David Goggins always said, you don't want to run today. Go out and run. You're afraid of public speaking. Go out and can public speed. You don't want to do it. Just do it. Well, it's been a great trip. I'm pretty sure it's been a great trip. See you next time.
