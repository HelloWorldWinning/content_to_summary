*   **Unification:** Zhao Kuangyin's ascension led to the unification of various regional powers, establishing a stable and unified Song Dynasty, ending the chaos of the Five Dynasties period.
*   **Civilized Governance:** The relatively peaceful nature of the Chenqiao Mutiny (陈桥兵变) contributed to the Song Dynasty's political culture moving towards a more civilized and rational approach to governance.
*   **Minimized Casualties:** Unlike other instances of power seizure through military force, Zhao Kuangyin's rise was achieved with almost no bloodshed, setting it apart from other "gun-barrel politics" scenarios.
