**Summary:**

**I. Core Principles for Wealth Building**

*   **Leverage Advantages:** In your 20s, use flexibility and time to take risks and discover your talents, focusing on high-demand skills rather than just passions. Consider entrepreneurship over being a mere employee.
*   **Capital Accumulation:** Develop an "army of capital" through investments that generate passive income over time.
*   **Discipline and Investing:** Recognize the critical power of compound interest. Start investing early and consistently, even with small amounts. Don't delay starting due to perceived insufficient funds or being "too late."
*   **Mindset:** Be transparent about money matters with peers to foster financial literacy and overcome cultural taboos.

**II. Key Obstacles and Solutions**
*   **Overspending:** A major hurdle is the inability to save, with most people spending what they earn.
*   **Cultural Taboo:**  Avoid the stigma of talking about money.  Open discussions are crucial for financial understanding.
*  **Asymmetry of Information:** Recognize that information asymmetry, like salary secrecy, benefits those with more knowledge, not employees.

**III. Personal Insight from Scott Galloway**

*   **Personal Journey:** Having experienced wealth multiple times, Galloway stresses the importance of financial security.
*   **Social Observations:** He notes the contrast between America's generous spirit when money is abundant, and its ruthlessness when it's lacking.
*   **Peer Influence:**  While peer groups share similar characteristics, the financial success of individuals within those groups varies significantly, which he aims to understand.

**Core Point:** Consistent investment over time is the key to wealth accumulation.

**Fundamental Point:** Openly discussing finances with peers is crucial for gaining financial literacy and making informed decisions.

**Overarching Framework:** The content presents a framework for achieving financial security by emphasizing strategic advantages, disciplined investment, and open discussions about finances, while debunking common misconceptions and overcoming cultural barriers.

 Let's be honest, it's the boring s*** that makes you rich. And the most unbelievable way for generating wealth and long term economic security is and then once you do that, you can become a super tax-avoider. That sounded awful. Scott Galloway, one of the world's leading voices in business and finance is back. His mission is to help millions of people build incredible wealth and live a life of economic security. If you're trying to build wealth, you want to lean into your advantages. Your advantages in your 20s are flexibility and time. So, take risks, find your talent, not your passion. It has a 90% plus employment rate. Or become an owner, not an earner. And develop an army of capital that goes out and kills for you at night. And then invest it. What if you're not young? Focus on the things you can't control. One thing that is within your control is spending. But 98% of us will spend everything we get our hands on. It is very hard to have the discipline to take money that is within your grasp and invest it. And we've done appreciate the power of investing and compound interest. My team bought a bucket of sand to illuminate the power of compounding interest. This is investing 1,000 a month over the course of 12 months, starting at the age of 25. If you left it and kept investing at that rate, by the age of 65, it would look like this. And the young man who says, I have 500 pounds, I can wait until I have a million before I start investing. The way you get a million pounds is by investing at 500. And this notion that it's too late for me, I'm in my 40s, I'm going to ignore finances. So what is the set of steps? Let me make it easy. First thing. Congratulations, Dora Vasir, gang. We've made some progress. 63% of you that listen to this podcast regularly don't subscribe, which is down from 69%. Our goal is 50%. So if you've ever liked any of the videos we've posted, if you liked this channel, can you do me a quick favour and hit the subscribe button? It helps this channel more than you know, and the bigger the channel gets, as you've seen, the bigger the guests get. Thank you and enjoy this episode. Scott, you've written a book on wealth, money, finance. Why? And why does it, why does it matter? This is kind of a memo to my 25 year old self. I've been rich three times in the first few times I lost it. And I didn't grow up with a lot of money. It's been very important to me. I think America and mostly in Europe, but especially America, America becomes more like itself every day. And that is it's a generous, loving place. If you have money, it's a rapacious, violent place. If you don't, I think economic security is really important. And I think there's a series of habits and character traits that can help you get to economic security. You know that study that you become the average of your five closest friends, same body mass index, same politics, same sports team, same neighborhood. What they don't talk about is that amongst those five people, even if they're all making about the same amount of money, one will end up much more economically well off than the other four. And I'm trying to understand the behaviors of that one person who becomes economically secure by the time they're my age without making a lot more money than their colleagues. Do you think we're taught about money? Where do those people, that one in five, what did they learn about money? Yeah, that's a really interesting question. I think so the honest answer is I don't know. What I would say sociologically is that rich people talk about money. And it's considered taboo for employees in middle class and lower class and women to talk about money. Like you're told not to talk about your salary at work. Asymmetry of information will always benefit the person that has symmetry, the nose information. The boss of a company knows what everyone's making, but he tells his or her employees not to discuss their salary because Lisa might find out the Bob is making 30% more for doing the same work. So there's a bit of a zeitgeist that tells people not to talk about money, that it's like talking about porn or that it's vulgar. And I think you need to start talking about money and maintain a certain level of financial literacy from a very early age. Because Roger Federer talks about tennis. If you want to be good at anything, most people want to be good at money. And to be good at something you need to understand it and to understand it, you need to talk about it. So I'm very transparent with how much money I make, what I do with it. But talk to your friends about mortgage rates. Talk to your friends about how much money they make, what they're doing with it, where they lost money and people aren't transparent about it, especially I think about men. We're supposed to be just like accidentally wealthy. And to ever talk about our financial problems is to admit that we're not ballers or they're we're not masculine. And so I encourage people from a young age to start talking about money and understand it and be transparent about it. Where did you learn about money? Because I think about my own life, I think there's key moments of quite frankly luck. Yeah. Well, I was exposed to information because I was invited.
