Content:
First of all, I want to say that the topic shared today is very important. It can explain an observation I have made over the years: why most Chinese people you see on the street have no smiles on their faces. And why in Chinese culture, there are good people who do not live long and evil people who live for thousands of years. In a sentence, when I was doing my graduation thesis, I once thought about why Chinese people don’t like to laugh as the topic of my graduation thesis. Since I was in junior high school, I like to watch European and American movies and TV series, and I feel that people under European and American culture Most of them smiled brightly. Later, because the thesis advisor asked them to do one of the several topics provided by the school, they did not do the topic they wanted to do. But the question still exists, that is, compared with people in European and American cultures, why do Chinese people have so few faces? There is a smile and often you can feel hostility or malice and I still I found that people in Chinese culture are prone to infer malicious motives for other people's behavior, that is, they think of others as bad people. Just like this example mentioned by Mr. Wu Zhihong many times, the most classic story in this regard is in my memory. In the movie Kill Bill, the white-browed Taoist priest once greeted the abbot of Shaolin Temple and the abbot ignored him. People may not have noticed that Bai Mei also thought of this possibility, but he still felt that he was humiliated and destroyed the Shaolin Temple. The following is the sharing content of this book. After listening to it, we can discuss in the comment area what sex is at the beginning of human beings. Is nature inherently good or inherently evil? How do evil deeds in a person arise? Why is it said that the hatred between people is often the result of the devil in one's heart projected outward? How to be aware of the hatred rising in one's heart and then transform it Chinese Let’s explain why conspiracy theories are prevalent. What is the absurdity of conspiracy theories? Today we continue to read the book Giant Baby Country. Today’s reading chapter has the answers to the above questions. Today we read that the girl who abused babies is born bad and aware of hostility. Imagination games transform your hostility. Imagination games and the psychological logic of conspiracy theories. If you want to hear more content, you can subscribe to my YouTube channel. After reading this book, I will share more on the topic of detoxifying Chinese culture. Relevant books Let’s work together to kill the Chinese cultural virus in our minds. At the individual level, we must achieve cultural exodus from Egypt and jump to the state of modern civilization as soon as possible. Let’s start. Baby abuse. Girls are born bad. Children are innocent people and evil is in them. As we grow older, we become tainted in the evil profit-oriented society. This is a statement that is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, but it is wrong. There are many examples to prove this, such as the case of an 11-year-old child in Chongqing who was exposed in December 2013. The evil in this incident of a girl abusing Yuan Yuan, a one-year-old baby, has made countless adults feel frightened and trembled. When she entered the elevator on the first floor, she met Yuan Yuan and Yuan Yuan’s grandmother, Ms. Li. Ms. Li got out of the elevator first, and she picked up Yuan Yuan. After getting off him, she immediately brutally abused Yuan Yuan after the elevator closed. She pulled Yuan Yuan back to her home on the 25th floor. She allegedly threw Yuan Yuan downstairs. When she went out, she happened to meet Ms. Li who was looking for her grandson on the 25th floor. She lied to her about leaving Li. The lady went downstairs and moved Yuan Yuan away from where she fell. The entire process of nearly torturing a living child to death in order to cover up the crime only lasted 5 minutes. When she and the child were alone, this 11-year-old girl was extremely crazy, but when others were present, her intelligence operated at a high speed and effectively. How can a girl who has just turned 10 years old be so insidious and calm? The simple answer is that she may have conduct disorder. Conduct disorder can be said to be the precursor of the antisocial personality we often hear. Conduct disorder may not develop into antisocial personality, but antisocial people People with personality disorder will definitely have conduct disorder when they are teenagers. The reason why minors are not called antisocial personality is because according to the classics, a person cannot form personality until he is 18 years old. However, the performance of conduct disorder and antisocial personality is very similar to that of antisocial personality. The characteristics of adults or teenagers with conduct disorders can be summarized in the following sentences. They often do evil, that is, they are anti-social. Doing evil, especially hurting others will bring them happiness, that is, their happiness is based on hurting others. When they do evil, they don't have the slightest rule to restrain them, and they can behave as smoothly as clouds and flowing water, so they have a special charm. Another characteristic of them is that they have no profit purpose or even emotional purpose when they do evil. They just catch them randomly and pass by them. Living creatures are especially weak And beautiful things, such as children's pets or women's bottomless attacks, this 11-year-old girl's terror is a display of these characteristics, and this is not the first time she has done evil. Neighbors said she often paddled other people's cars and made her cry many times. Children and classmates said the incident She once said she wanted to get a baby A teenager with a severe conduct disorder can easily cause great harm to society if his bag is thrown from upstairs. Yuan Yuan’s abuse is far from an isolated case. If you do a related search, you will see that there are a large number of children at home and abroad who torture and kill infants. Horror incidents, where does the evil in them come from, modern psychology Through years of systematic observation of infants, we have found that infants cannot be said to be angels but a combination of angels and devils. The younger they are, the more terrifying the evil in them is. The hatred of infants who are still in their infancy can easily reach the point of wanting to destroy the entire world. It's just that they don't have a real attack So this evil has no consequences. It can be said that this evil is innate, so why doesn’t everyone become a villain? Because the way this evil can be transformed is to love first the mother and then other important caregivers. Can build a stable and high-quality baby The relationship is full of emotional flow, often making eye contact like a deeply loved lover, often embracing intimately, and never lacking in verbal praise. Then the evil in the baby will be transformed, and the angelic side of him will become dominant and preliminary. With the ability to love, the world is in pairs like the sky A devil -like baby appears with the full love of his parents. A devil-like baby appears with a severe lack of love and abuse. The evil deeds of a teenage girl in Chongqing also appear with the lack of love and abuse of her parents. After the incident was exposed, he Father Mr. Li told the media that his daughter was very happy She likes children and small animals, but there is a problem with the way she expresses herself. Her daughter says that the boy makes funny faces to her and is unfriendly, so kicking and hitting the boy to hurt the baby boy is her daughter’s way of expressing her feelings. She hopes that the baby boy will smile at her and be friendly to her. His wife usually beats and scolds her daughter. Let 's all listen to these words to what extent they have an impact on my daughter's character. You will know something is wrong because there is no apology, no pain, no guilt. The core flaw of conduct disorder and antisocial personality is the lack of empathy. Empathy can be simply understood as compassion. This father clearly lacks empathy. If his wife is the same, It's not surprising that they raised such a daughter. Many studies attribute the cause of antisocial personality to being born bad. Such as brain trauma or even genetic problems, that is, they have irreversible physiological causes. Psychoanalysis tends to believe that the trauma of antisocial personality occurs in infancy or even early infancy, so healing becomes extremely difficult. All these statements express a sense of powerlessness, that is, there is nothing we can do about antisocial personality, so the social correction system Can it work? Is it difficult? If not corrected, it can be expected that their antisocial behavior will continue. Therefore, juveniles with conduct disorders who have committed serious crimes cannot simply return to their families because their families have no possibility of correcting them, so the judicial system should change. The simplest way to deal with these teenagers is to restrict their personal freedom until they develop anti-social tendencies. Why is it so difficult to change toward being inhibited? Mr. Li's words are the answer. You can tell from his words that in his daughter's eyes, of course Mr. Li is probably the same. No matter how small the problem is for others, it is still a big problem. For example, when a baby boy makes a face and is caught by her, If you treat it as unfriendly and fight, no matter how big your problem is, it is a small problem or even no problem. For example, Mr. Li said that their fight The scolding behavior has some impact on the daughter. They do this because her personality is extremely fragile and cannot accept introspection. They regard it as a fatal attack on the fragile self and will cause self-collapse. Because of this characteristic, self-improvement of their personality structure cannot happen automatically. A perfect social system must understand this and let go of related childish practices. Here I am We can think of a case that happened last year. The case of three junior high school students in Handan, Hebei Province who killed their classmates. The verdict was recently announced. Many people were not satisfied with the verdict. Imagination games with awareness of hostility. This kind of mentality is often seen in people with particularly bad interpersonal relationships. Logic first, you have to follow mine. Second, otherwise I will be angry. Third, my anger attacks you and you will definitely fight back. My fourth, then I found out that all your actions were to fight back against me. Fifth, I was wronged. I didn’t do anything to you. Why are you so cruel? So I will be even more angry. This can be called hostility. The five-part imaginary is the interpersonal relationship of these people. The direct cause of serious trouble in a relationship is the control caused by almighty narcissism. The second step is the anger caused by the failure of control. Although these two films Of course it is the source of the problem, but the key is the third and fourth steps. Usually, these third and fourth steps are their imagination rather than reality. The reality is that the other party does not fight back or even knows that you have been angry, so there is this The questioner needs to remind himself that his anger will be seen and will lead to retaliation. This is mostly his imagination rather than reality. For example, a man He wanted to talk to a colleague. The other person didn't notice him, so he didn't respond to him. He was so angry that he wanted to slap the other person. The whole process happened in his heart. The other person didn't notice it at all, but he felt that the other person saw his anger, as if he was He was transparent while others were clairvoyant and then started to fight back against him. For example, he became more and more indifferent to him and even looked at him coldly when talking to others. It was probably because they were talking bad about him. He felt that his colleague's retaliation went too far and he felt aggrieved, so he became even more angry at his colleague. However, the colleague was unaware of the whole process, but at the same time he felt that something was wrong. The distance between the two seemed to have become inexplicably farther, so his colleague alienated him, which further convinced him that this process was real. He is a psychologically motivated person. It can be said that he only lives in his heart and no one else lives in him. Therefore, his entire process seems to be an imagination to onlookers, but he believes that this is what really happened. From the ultimate result, it is It's true that because he keeps projecting hostility outwards, everyone will eventually stay away from him, but every specific process is mostly just a figment of his own imagination. The elephant shapes reality because he only has himself in his heart. But please don’t think this is selfish. Therefore, his heart divides the world into two parts. The part he can control is kind, and the part he cannot control is full of hostility, so he is inevitably Pursue controlling others, but once the control fails, you will fall into panic, anger and hostility. Imagine that the first two steps of the five-part series start from here. It comes from the fact that he only has himself in his heart, so when he looks at others, he can only start from himself, so he will form this logic: "I am angry with you, you will definitely be angry with me. " The you in it is not the real other person but the other person. A mirror image of himself. When I am angry in front of the mirror, an equally angry person will naturally appear in the mirror. This is the logical root of the third step. It is difficult to change these three steps, even through consultation, it will take a long time to fundamentally change. The reason for transformation is that through long-term consultation, a person has really lived in his heart, so he no longer controls it and no longer suffers because of the failure of control. Anger no longer thinks that others will be angry because of your own anger, but don’t feel desperate because of it. Although these three steps are difficult to change quickly, they are In fact, the fourth step is the key to hurting interpersonal relationships, and awareness of the fourth step can bring about great changes. This awareness can be summed up very simply, that is, you realize that you are completely living in your imagination and put your Imagine projecting to the external world, but in fact the real world is not what you projected. For example, in another example, a student stood next to me during a class and wanted to ask When I asked a question, she was the second one to come. Originally, there was a classmate in front of me talking to me, but after the conversation with the student in front was over, the third and fourth students came up to talk to me, and I didn't notice her at all. Waiting next to me, she finally fell into a rage. At this moment, she wanted to kill me. I need to explain that this kind of thing happened many times in my class. So she in the article does not refer to a specific person. After she left, she always felt that I had seen her murdering me, so she would also see her as hostile. But fortunately, she also thought that this might be just an imagination, so she came to find me. After communicating with each other, I discovered that I didn’t know the whole process at all. As a teacher and Wu Zhihong himself (the one who is reading the manuscript is not Wu Zhihong), I can fully understand and accept that. She had the idea of ​​killing me, and I didn't feel hurt or angry about it. In the process of clarifying with me, she discovered her imagination and projection and saw my true situation as another person, that is, I didn't. If she is angry and not hurt, in this specific communication, I can live in her heart as a well-meaning existence, and she has the right to me. The logic that others must be angry when others are angry has changed a little bit. If she can often clarify her inner self in this way, a real and practical change can occur. A process like this happens in large numbers in the interaction between children and parents. Psychoanalysis puts this into perspective. The process called detoxification means that children are prone to anger and imagine that the other party will retaliate just like themselves. Anger and revenge are considered poisonous as aggression, but his parents did not retaliate. He was not even hurt by his attack. Instead, he liked his energy. As a result, his hostile imagination process was purified. Reading this reminded me of cartoons. There is a line in Kung Fu Panda: Master Oogway sees the dark side in Dalong’s heart so that he can come back. Of course, this process takes place in a relatively mature age. Between parents and children, if the parents are like babies, once they discover that their children are hostile to them, they feel that the children have seriously attacked themselves, so they retaliate and force the children to apologize, then this detoxification will not happen and may even become a process of increasing the poisoning of the children. There will be more and more hostile imaginations, and two extreme results will eventually occur. The first is that the hostility is too strong and cannot be restrained, so the spleen He gets angry and attacks others everywhere. Second, he learns to suppress his anger, but he feels that anger is poisonous, so he suppresses it too much and causes a person to lose vitality. The process of detoxification also happens in reality. If you find that you have serious hostile imagination and he It hurts your interpersonal relationship so boldly to clarify. At this time, you need to choose a partner first from the sincere and gentle people who you think have good intentions. If you start with a warm person, for example, if you start with someone who has a hostile imagination, then you can create hostility even if there is no hostility in the first place. It only takes a few profound clarifications and you will know that the fourth step is that others have seen it. You are angry and all your actions are angry with you. This is indeed imagined. After realizing this, it means that you have created hostility towards yourself. Once you have basic awareness, this is an important basis for your self-change. If the degree of hostile imagination is very severe and you don't believe that others will tell the truth, then just asking someone to clarify occasionally may not bring about real awareness. Once you are hurt, you will If you have too much impact, it is very necessary to find a professional. This professional will understand the importance of clarifying with you and will welcome you to do it with him. Various clarifications and the initiative to discuss your relationship with you. If you try to discuss your relationship with your psychiatrist and explore your perceptions and imagination of him, you will find that the psychiatrist will immediately become defensive and avoid talking about you. What happened between you and him, then he is not a professional. If you find that you have hostile thoughts and can Bear all kinds of clarifications. Be bold and clarify with all kinds of people. This means that you will step out of your lonely imaginary world and enter the real world. The real world itself is healing. Hostility can cause harm to relationships, but there is no solution. Rather than suppressing hostility, it is also important to clarify and express hostility frankly. For example, a girl has been trying her best to hide her strong jealousy, but the jealousy still persists. From time to time, her strong jealousy and superficial flattery formed an extreme contrast, which caused many problems. Now she has learned to express it, that is, I am jealous of you, but she is no longer ashamed of jealousy. At this time, he discovered that most people are jealous of him. It's quite acceptable, and because he became sincere, the relationship became much smoother. In parent-child relationships and partnership relationships, this is as important as detoxification. The important thing is to be aware of your own anger, express your anger openly, and at the same time be tolerant and able to transform hostility in communication. It would be great if you can do this. I have always liked the common feeling in American TV dramas and express anger to each other sharply, but They are both strong and able to withstand communication and resolution. As the Chinese proverb says, "No fight, no acquaintance" is also the natural result of anger flowing in a relationship. In the end, In particular, let’s talk about an important psychological mechanism in this hostile imagination: transparency. It is often called mind reading by professionals. That is, I can read your mind without communicating, and my mind will also be read by you. There are many things in people’s hearts. Darkness, especially hostility, if you have this psychological mechanism, it means that since others can see your hostility, there will no longer be a place for it, but In fact, understanding is very difficult. Even if two people communicate very sincerely, it is not easy to understand. Why do you talk about how I can read your mind without speaking? Even if Buddhism says that there is such a supernatural power as the mind, it is extremely difficult. When it comes to spiritual practice and practice, I prefer the word transparent to the word mind-reading because many people have various transparent intentions in their imaginations, perceptions and dreams. It is common that some people think that they are transparent, some think that others are transparent, some think that everyone is transparent, and some people will dream that their house is transparent. People with this intention or feeling usually believe that they can know others without communicating. What's going on? It gives me a sense of control, which means I understand the world. But in turn, it might be a nightmare. How do I look to others? We know that transparent imagery should be a kind of psychological retention in early infancy. Babies who are 6 months old will believe that they and their mother are the same person, a community, and a symbiotic relationship. I am you and you are me, so we can know how each other is doing without communicating. Transparency is a nightmare but also a desire, that is, you and I can embrace each other without distance. This intention has a lightweight expression. For example, sincerity in an intimate relationship. Sometimes telling the truth in an intimate relationship will have bad consequences, but you feel that you must tell the truth, you cannot lie, and you cannot play tactics, because lying and playing tactics mean that there is no transparency between us, the intimacy is reduced, and we cannot coexist. For example, a friend of mine is a beautiful woman but had a very promiscuous sexual history. When she got a new boyfriend, she couldn't help but tell him about her true past. The result would be a breakup. She knew it was problematic, but she just couldn't help it. Say if I don't tell the other person All of me, there is a rift between us and we can’t be intimate. In the American TV series The Big Bang Theory, Penny said to the newly moved blonde beauty, you can’t use these 4 poor physicists. They have no protective layer, which means these 4 Otakus all have something to say about how they don’t understand relationship strategies. What’s interesting is that these four otakus have never left their mother’s world. They are all transparent to their mothers. For such otakus, they will have a strange contradiction, although they are honest. I can't lie but I want to be with him It is not easy for them to be truly intimate because they actually have a transparent wall. That is to say, in their dreams and self-perception, they feel as if they are covered in a glass wall, plastic film or even a film that flows like water, separating them from others. Separation is because they feel that they cannot lie in the symbiotic relationship with their mother, so they must be honest, but they are also afraid of this relationship, which makes them feel swallowed up, so they have to set up a barrier with their mother, but they cannot do it consciously. so look It still needs to be transparent, but it can still separate him from his mother and even other people. This is an accurate expression. In fact, the so-called transparency is still a wall. This wall is necessary, otherwise all protection will be lost, so it is difficult for sincere otakus to say Feelings from the heart As for those clients who feel that they and others are mind readers, it is actually difficult for them to tell their true thoughts during consultation. This can also have other changes. For example, a netizen said that my mother felt that he did not need to say anything to others. You should know but When others don't say anything, she justifiably feels that she should know nothing. This is simply my nightmare. This mother is just doing it to the baby. The mother must understand the baby, but the baby does not have to understand the mother. Change your hostility. Imagine the game. Hostility is like It is the poison in our hearts. It originally comes from out-of-control devils and damaged narcissism. When the self is not strong enough and the understanding of the darkness and light of human nature is not correct enough, we will throw out the poison in our hearts everywhere. When we meet people with strong hearts, they will help us Detoxification, but it is often the poison that we throw out from others, which in turn dumps the poison into us, which leads to all kinds of battles. This process is very complicated. We are all almighty narcissistic dragons. This chapter talks about how we throw out the poison. In other words, hostility will arouse hostility, and kindness will bring kindness. I have seen many people who can often save danger when traveling or doing things. They meet all kinds of noble people, and few people even want to hurt them. In my opinion, it is indeed because they exude in their hearts. Be kind and have people around you be kind in return It's easy to say that hostility arouses hostility, but the process is often very subtle. It's not easy for us to realize it. Two years ago, I went to Beijing to record a program for a website. The recording time started at two o'clock in the afternoon. To be safe, I took an 8 o'clock flight early in the morning from I took off from Guangzhou and arrived at Beijing Airport at 11 o'clock. I arrived at the recording studio before 12 o'clock. When I got there, I was a little dumbfounded. I had cooperated with this website before and knew that the conditions where they record programs were good. I arrived at noon and could find a room to rest for a while. It is necessary to take a lunch break otherwise you will be out of energy in the afternoon, but this time the studio was just chosen. It was also the first time for them to use this studio and they did not understand the situation. It is relatively simple and has no resting place at all. There was no staff to greet me when I arrived. I was originally asked if I wanted a hotel room and I said no, so I really can’t blame anyone, but I felt neglected and thought the staff should at least know something about the studio, but they didn’t know the situation in the studio. It’s time to wait blindly So I called the staff responsible for receiving me to express my dissatisfaction. The receptionist was a girl or one of my fans was a little panicked when she heard my expression of dissatisfaction. Although I finished expressing my dissatisfaction, I reassured her and said it was okay, but she still felt guilty and she hurried away. Come over and eat something with me and find a place to rest for a while. Finally, we found a very quiet cafe to eat something and drink a cup of coffee. After that, I sat on a chair, closed my eyes and rested, and took a nap. My secret trick is to sit on a chair, keep my body centered, feel my body, and then fall asleep. This is called active rest, while ordinary sleep is passive rest. Usually active rest, even for only 5 minutes, can have a very good effect. The girl who received me I am very attentive and I am not a difficult customer, so there is no unpleasantness between us. However, there are always various small mishaps, such as difficulty in taking a taxi, the taxi driver making mistakes in finding the way, and this is simple. It shouldn't have happened, but they were all minor inconveniences, and I didn't take them seriously until something big happened before the recording of the show. I had to change the clothes used in the show, and the clothes were new. When I put on my pants, There was a nail that was attached to the nameplate that was not removed. I used too much force and scratched the nail, causing a big gash in my hand. Blood gushed out in that moment. I suddenly became quiet and clearly felt that although the receptionist I was very considerate, but I had strong dissatisfaction throughout the entire process. On the surface, I was a considerate and easy-to-negotiate person, but inside I was full of dissatisfaction. I believe it was my dissatisfaction or hostility that aroused hostility from the outside world. The result was. . . There are always all kinds of small mishaps on the road, and this big hole seemed to be a purely objective incident, but it also seemed to be a response to the hostility of the outside world towards me. With this awareness, I quickly dealt with it with the help of the staff. Wound Then I closed my eyes and stayed quiet for a while to become aware of the hostility in my heart. Being aware of this hostility kept my body in a slightly trembling state, which is what is called shaking with anger, but it is very slight. If you don't feel it carefully, you won't feel it. When I carefully became aware of the hostility in my emotions, the tremors in my body, the thoughts in my head that I felt I was being neglected, they became quiet after being aware of them. Then I felt the feeling of my feet on the ground and the feeling of sitting on the chair. The purpose of this was to establish a link between the body and the neutral existence. It actually only took two or three minutes to do this. I felt that the restlessness in my body disappeared. Then things went smoothly and there were no more minor problems. From then on, I had an idea. If you have troubles one after another, no matter how big or small, you need to be quiet to see if there is any hostility in your heart and then try to appease it. I will also share this experience during lectures, and many students have reported that it is really useful and that they have never been aware of themselves before. It’s so easy to be upset and so easy to be hostile, and accordingly it also arouses hostility from the outside world. In fact, this time I The reason why I was able to realize what happened was that the consultation from a visitor played a big role. I wrote his story before. He rode a bicycle to exercise in the morning, and the bicycle ran out of air. He wanted to repair the bicycle, but because it was too early, the parking lot was closed. He wanted to find a brand repair shop before it opened, but it didn't open either. After a series of troubles happened, he suddenly felt like he was being persecuted. He felt that there was a big devil behind all these troubles. This imagination shocked him at the time. The ability of awareness is like a magnifying glass or even a microscope, which can reveal how your heart develops and changes. Consultation environment It will greatly improve the awareness of clients and psychological counselors, so they can see their own inner development and changes in this matter. I found that this seemingly ordinary thing is actually not simple. I don’t seem to have much reaction on the outside. In fact, I am in a state of turmoil inside. It’s just a question of whether I can be aware of it. I often say something like a breeze on the conscious level, and a huge wave on the subconscious level. This is an example. The most exaggerated example occurred in a special experience of mine. I went to Fujian Nanchan Temple to receive Vipassana training. For 10 days, I handed over my mobile phone to the temple management. I got up at 4: 30 in the morning and rested at 10 in the evening. I did one thing in the middle, meditated and felt my body from head to toe. In this kind of environment, people 's awareness will be heightened. When I was very high, I was meditating with my eyes closed. My right thigh hurt a little bit, as if something had stabbed me. If it were normal, it would be natural. I went to scratch the itch, but according to the rules of Vipassana, the body must remain still at this time and continue to meditate and feel the body, so I restrained my urge to scratch it. Almost at the same time, a series of pictures appeared in my mind. A wasp stung my thigh. The eggs were injected into the body at once and the eggs hatched into golden bugs. The bugs kept multiplying and the thighs rotted quickly. This meant that you would scratch them whenever you felt itchy. In fact, there is a fear of parasitism, but he has no ability to be aware of this fear. This can only be done in an internal meditation environment. For the visitor, if there was no consultation environment, he would not be aware of the consequences of a broken bicycle. Giving him so many hostile images, for me, this experience with this visitor increased my awareness of myself, so this recording of the program was Being able to perceive that there are such serious psychological changes behind seemingly ordinary things. In Tokugawa Ieyasu's novel Tokugawa Ieyasu, Shiba Ryotaro said that Tokugawa Ieyasu had a military advisor, Nantenbo Tenkai. When he was young, he was determined to resolve conflicts among the princes. However, wherever he went, the disputes became more intense. Later, as his practice progressed, he gradually realized that because his heart was full of passion, He has strong hostility, so no matter where he goes, although he consciously wants to do peaceful things, the hostility in his heart inspires greater hostility in the surrounding environment, so he must first appease his heart before he can appease the world. Although this may be just a statement made by Shiba Ryotaro, he It is indeed a truth. The psychological logic of the conspiracy theory is pregnant with various possibilities. But there are various possibilities hidden in the vagueness. It can make people uneasy and uncomfortable. In the most extreme cases, it can make people feel out of control. People who feel out of control will rush to escape from the ambiguity and seek certainty so that they can regain their sense of control. Conspiracy theories will inevitably become popular after various major events happen because he gave conspiracy theories Believers have a false sense of control. The disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 has not yet been confirmed. This will make countless people confused. Therefore, conspiracy theories are becoming more popular, especially various conspiracy theories that point to the United States. If you open a certain search and enter the keywords Malaysia Airlines conspiracy United States, you will see the following news. Don’t you think Malaysia Airlines is a conspiracy operator? It is probably Uncle Sam. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines is a conspiracy of the United States. The Malaysia Airlines incident may be a conspiracy of the United States. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines may be a conspiracy of the United States. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines is a conspiracy of the United States. Be on guard against the Malaysian Airlines MH370 incident. It was an out-and-out American conspiracy. These headlines are already a bit hysterical. But if you open any major reports about the Malaysian Airlines incident and click on the comments below, you will see even more hysterical conspiracy theories. These theories all have this kind of argument. I feel like this is not an inference. I am extremely sure that this is a fact. The United States has not always been like this. Why? In September 2001, what I was doing when I first started working happened to be international news. Not long after, the 911 incident happened, and then came the US-initiated war in Afghanistan, the second Gulf War, etc. At that time, what was the US government under the administration of George W. Bush doing to the world? There are far more things than now. I have been doing international journalism for several years and am very dedicated. This kind of theory does not form an American conspiracy theory at all. There will be no speculation about the Malaysian Airlines incident, but I am very familiar with this argument, so I predict that the Malaysian Airlines incident, which has always been suspenseful, will definitely arouse more widespread American conspiracy theories. What is interesting is that American conspiracy theories are not only the speculation of ordinary netizens on some networks. There are also some psychology professionals in Big V, but their expressions are particularly depressing. Perhaps psychology professionals Are they afraid that their peers will diagnose them with delusions of persecution? They know consciously that there is something wrong with this argument but cannot control their inner tendencies. So how do you view American conspiracy theories from a psychological point of view? Use my previous theory of control and loss of control to explain it. The simplest thing is that there is still no definite answer to the Malaysia Airlines incident, which makes people very uneasy. Conspiracy theories can give people a sense of certainty. Why is it the United States that points to both certain and uncertain disasters in the world? The country with the greatest influence on the world blames the United States Becoming the devil leader responsible for all evils is indeed a simple attribution, but this attribution is an out-and-out delusion of persecution. How does a person perceive the outside world? American psychologist Kohut divides this into The first level of the four levels is the best because you trust the outside world and therefore can pour your enthusiasm into the outside world. The second level is the second best because you over-idealize the outside world. For example, you think the United States is the savior of the world. The third level is The next worst thing is to perceive the outside world as a demanding god who will satisfy you Some demands but very harsh. If you make the slightest mistake, they will punish you. For example, the fourth level of cult believers is the worst. This is the worst level where you perceive the outside world as being controlled by an omnipotent persecutor. Persecution can also be divided into two levels. First, you are easily aware of being persecuted, but what persecutes you is that many factors are not unified into a whole. Second, you feel that there is a systematic persecutor who does all the bad things. He is responsible for this systematic persecution, which is also known as the delusion of persecution. It is a classic symptom of paranoid schizophrenia. A person suffering from this symptom will feel that he is being monitored by a harming system built by an omnipotent person. All misfortunes and accidents that persecute him are caused by him and this system. The serious American conspiracy theory is largely consistent with the persecution delusion. First, everything is connected. They all have a responsible person. Second, the United States has built a system with various forces that is almost omnipotent. Third, anyone dares to cooperate with The power of confrontation in the United States, such as Putin, is amazing, so those who hold this view People will easily connect the Ukraine crisis, the Malaysian Airlines flight incident, the Diaoyu Islands dispute and the South China Sea disputes, etc. , and feel that the United States is playing a big game to divert the attention of the Chinese government by using the Chinese people on the Malaysian Airlines flight, etc. As a former media person who once hoped to become an expert on international issues, I would like to say that although the United States is very powerful and has extraordinary influence, its influence is far from being so specific and subtle. In fact, this is exactly what people with conspiracy theories imagine in the next game. The real world is full of chance and accident, and the mind In the world, it is easy to move towards the theory of cause and effect, and various factors are easily linked together. I would like to add here that as long as you study logic, probability theory and other knowledge, especially if you understand Bayes' law, you will be immune to conspiracy theories. Come back here Isn't it quite refreshing to read this book like this? When the mind imagines it like this, it seems that the whole world has become a game of chess controlled by one's own mind. He has become the person playing chess. Wang Xiaobo wrote in an essay that once he and his brother went to visit a friend. The buddy is standing in front of a world map pointing out the country and scolding Fang Qiu's imagination I am commanding thousands of troops, how can I conquer the United States, etc. These are the two sides of the American conspiracy theorist. In fact, people with this theory are delusional about how to control the world. They imagine the United States as a devil. In fact, they live in their own hearts. With such an almighty god who wants to control everything, once this god is frustrated, he will turn into a demon. Everything is projected outward. Here I would like to add that it is difficult for us to be absolutely objective when looking at the world. Most of us wear colored glasses. When you look at the world with red lenses, you can look at the world Your spectacle lenses are red and your spectacle lenses are blue. When you look at the world, it is blue. It is not easy to realize that your spectacle lenses are colored. And it is even more difficult to change your spectacle lenses to colorless and transparent spectacle lenses.
