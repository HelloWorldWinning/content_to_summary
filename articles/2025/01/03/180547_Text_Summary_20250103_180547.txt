Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Core Idea:** This study introduces a Bee Swarm Optimization (BSO) algorithm for exploring the structure of psychological measurement instruments, specifically within confirmatory bifactor models.
    *   The BSO algorithm is inspired by bee foraging behavior.
    *   Scout bees explore major model changes (e.g., adding/removing factors).
    *   Onlooker bees fine-tune existing models (e.g., adding/swapping items).
2.  **Application:** The algorithm simultaneously assigns items to nested factors and selects items for the final scale.
    *   It aims to balance exploration (diversification) and exploitation (intensification).
    *   It is demonstrated using two datasets (Holzinger-Swineford and short dark triad questionnaire).
3.  **Parameter Influence:** The study explores the impact of hyperparameters on the algorithm's performance, including the number of bees, scout-to-onlooker ratio, and the number of top solutions.
4.  **Conclusion (Core Point):** This study presents a novel BSO algorithm that effectively identifies underlying factor structures in psychological measurements by balancing exploratory and exploitative strategies.
5.  **Conclusion (Fundamental Point):** The core idea of BSO applied to psychological measurement provides a useful tool in uncovering complex factor structures by strategically combining exploration and refinement.

Metaheuristics are optimization algorithms that efficiently solve a variety of complex combinatorial problems. In psychological research, metaheuristics have been applied in short-scale construction and model specification search. In the present study, we propose a bee swarm optimization (BSO) algorithm to explore the structure underlying a psychological measurement instrument. The algorithm assigns items to an unknown number of nested factors in a confirmatory bifactor model, while simultaneously selecting items for the final scale. To achieve this, the algorithm follows the biological template of bees’ foraging behavior: Scout bees explore new food sources, whereas onlooker bees search in the vicinity of previously explored, promising food sources. Analogously, scout bees in BSO introduce major changes to a model specification (e.g., adding or removing a specific factor), whereas onlooker bees only make minor changes (e.g., adding an item to a factor or swapping items between specific factors). Through this division of labor in an artificial bee colony, the algorithm aims to strike a balance between two opposing strategies diversification (or exploration) versus intensification (or exploitation). We demonstrate the usefulness of the algorithm to find the underlying structure in two empirical data sets (Holzinger–Swineford and short dark triad questionnaire, SDQ3). Furthermore, we illustrate the influence of relevant hyperparameters such as the number of bees in the hive, the percentage of scouts to onlookers, and the number of top solutions to be followed. Finally, useful applications of the new algorithm are discussed, as well as limitations and possible future research opportunities.
