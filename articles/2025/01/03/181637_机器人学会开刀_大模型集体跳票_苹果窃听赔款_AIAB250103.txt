Hello everyone, the content of this episode is as follows . Side A, we focus on the amazing progress of dynamic robotic autonomous surgery at the forefront of AI, the reasons behind the collective delays in AI models, the innovative way AI is reshaping advertising, and the privacy controversy of Apple's SIRI eavesdropping. Side B, we go deep into the hinterland of scientific research. Explore how large language models can be combined with symbolic systems to continuously evolve symbolic solutions and enable AI knowledge discovery A new chapter in Artificial Life and how AI can autonomously explore the secrets of unlocking complex systems Wondering how AI can reshape our lives Lock in this issue of AIAB Johns Hopkins and Stanford researchers learn to act like robots by having them watch surgical videos Doctors can complete suturing, knotting and other tasks independently. This is not only a technological breakthrough but also a potential impact on the shortage of surgeons in the United States. The solution is similar to the principle of the AI ​​model we are familiar with , but this time the AI ​​processes the data of the robot's movement. After training, the robot can even communicate and receive instructions like a surgeon's assistant. Robot-assisted surgery is not new, but this breakthrough With autonomy, they can learn from their mistakes without human intervention , but the question arises as to who will be responsible for the surgery ? How to protect patient privacy? The AI ​​model has been delayed again. XAI founder Musk has promised that its next-generation model grok3 will be released at the end of 2024. GROK is regarded as a competitor of OpenAI's GPT4o and Google's GEMINI. It can analyze images and answer questions to drive people's development. Some features of the X platform but now it’s 2025G ROK3 has yet to arrive, and there are more signs that an intermediate model called grok2.5 may be released first. Does this indicate that AI model development has encountered new challenges? Not only XAI, but also ANTHROPIC's claude3.5opus and other flagship models of technology giants. Encountering a similar dilemma, this may mean that the traditional AI model expansion The method , that is, relying on a large amount of computing power and data training is no longer as effective as in the past. Will the bottleneck of the development of AI models be a new technological inflection point? AI is reshaping the advertising industry . This company raised 23 million to bring virtual product placement to TV. On rembrand, 1 AI startup is using AI to analyze videos frame by frame to seamlessly embed brand products into content. Their technology Not only for social media but also for connected TV. Think about it: you may be watching a cooking show and see a certain brand of drink on the table , but your friends see a different brand. How does this happen? rembrand The AI ​​dynamically implants brand products in post-production and adjusts them according to audience preferences. Currently, it includes Pepsi-Cola, L'Oreal, Asia Well-known brands such as Amazon are already customers and have received 250 million paid views in 2024. Rembrand also plans to launch a self-service platform and a free version to further expand its impact. Let us wait and see what the future of advertising will look like. SIRI on your phone may not be Well-behaved Apple has been in trouble recently. They were accused of letting SIRI sneak around. According to AP reports, in order to settle the lawsuit five years ago, Apple agreed to pay a settlement of US$95 million. It is said that SIRI not only listens when you say "Hey SIRI", but also when you don't call her. Silently recorded and these recordings may also be shared with advertisers to push more targeted ads. This is really shocking. Think about it . You may be able to hear clearly even talking to yourself while holding your phone. Although Apple claims to protect user privacy , this accusation is a bit of a slap in the face. Of course, Apple did not admit that it had done anything wrong in the settlement. If the settlement is approved, Apple users from 2014 to the end of last year can get up to $20 in compensation per device. Are you going to apply? We know that big language models are good at Processing natural language and learning complex patterns, while symbolic AI is good at processing logic and reasoning. But how to combine the advantages of the two to allow AI to truly understand and create knowledge? This paper proposes a bold idea to allow the continuous evolution of large language models to open symbolic solutions. The significance of this research on AI-driven knowledge discovery lies in his attempt to equip large language models with the ability to think symbolically. This may It is a key step towards general artificial intelligence. What is symbolic solution? Simply put, it is the use of symbolic forms to express scientific or engineering problems, such as mathematical formulas, logical expressions and codes. Traditional AI methods can often only be based on existing data. Looking for patterns , this paper attempts to give large language models the ability to create symbols. The core of the paper is the COEVO framework, which allows large language models to Various symbolic solutions are generated through tree search, just like brainstorming . These symbolic solutions will be put into the knowledge base for continuous accumulation and refinement. Then the large language model uses this knowledge to continuously evolve better symbolic solutions. This is not only the use of large language models. More importantly, the large language model is able to process symbols to generate symbols and use symbols for reasoning , which embodies the core ideological and experimental results of symbolic AI. The results show that COEVO surpasses existing methods in many scientific problems, especially in the discovery of symbolic solutions . This method has great potential in many fields that require symbolic solutions, such as the derivation of mathematical models for new materials, the structural design of drug molecules, and complex The logical expression of the system may accelerate scientific research and engineering innovation and have huge commercial value. COEVO’s code and data have already If you are interested in the combination of large language models and symbolic AI, you may want to study artificial life. Alife, as the name suggests, means creating life in computers . However, this life does not refer to specific organisms but to various complex organisms that can self-organize and evolve. Systematic research on alife has been like finding a needle in a haystack for a long time . Scientists can only rely on intuition and experience manually. Trying various simulation parameters is not only inefficient, but also easy to fall into a fixed mindset. The key problem is that simple rules can produce extremely complex emergent phenomena through large-scale interactions , which makes it difficult for us to predict the relationship between parameters and results. Imagine if Wouldn't it be cool to have AI explore these possibilities automatically? This paper proposes a new method, Automated Search for artificial life is called ASAL. Its core idea is to use powerful AI, especially foundation models, to automatically explore the simulated world of alife. ASAL is like an experienced explorer who can find us in various alife simulations according to our needs. The core mechanism of those papers of interest lies in the foundation of using visual language models to evaluate the AI ​​simulation results . In other words, it can not only understand the picture but also understand our description. ASAL has three main functions. First, it finds simulations that match our description, such as patterns flying like a flock of birds. Second , it finds those that can last. The simulations that produce novel changes are similar to the evolution of nature. The third is to explore a variety of simulations with obvious differences to help us fully understand the world of alife . The researchers used ASAL to test on multiple classic alife models, including boids, particle life, game of life, Lenia and neuron cellular automata. ASAL can really find the corresponding simulation results based on text descriptions, such as cell division in Lenia. Birds gathering in patterns or boids . What’s more interesting is that ASAL can also find those like Conway’s Game of Life. An open simulation that can continue to evolve , and ASAL can also help us draw a map of the entire simulated world to explore various strange phenomena that we have not seen before. The significance of this research is not just academic. It provides us with a new As a tool for exploring complex systems, ASAL may be used in the future to help in fields such as biology, materials science, and even urban planning. Help us solve problems that are difficult to deal with with traditional methods. For example, we can use ASAL to simulate the interaction between drugs and viruses or find new material design solutions. It also provides us with a new perspective that allows us to rethink the nature of life and intelligence . That ’s it for today’s video.
