Description:
好的，这是对您提供的文本的总结，包含核心要点、基本点、总体框架，以及使用 Mermaid 语法生成的概念图：

**总结：**

1.  **核心要点：** 面对未来写作项目时，人们常常因为害怕失败、缺乏时间等原因而拖延，因此需要以随意、少量、不完美的方式开始。

2.  **基本点：** 克服写作障碍的关键在于接受不完美的初稿，并以小步、持续的方式推进，而不是追求一开始就完美。

3. **总体框架：** 内容围绕如何克服对未来写作项目（例如未来自述、论文）的拖延和恐惧，核心方法是转变心态，接受不完美，从小处着手。

 When I talk to people about doing the future authoring program, they often put it off. And it's not surprising because it's hard. But it's more than that. They think, well, I don't know how to write. I'm going to do a bad job. I don't really like assignments. I'm going to have to do it perfectly. I need to wait till I have enough time. And one of those is enough to stop your cold, and all five of them, you're just done. And so I tell people, do it haphazardly, a tiny bit at a time, and badly. Because you can do that. I tell my students when they're doing their thesis, master's thesis, write a really bad first draft. And then we have a little conversation about that because they don't think I mean that. Because it sounds like a cliche in some sense. It's not a cliche. It's not a cliche at all. It means you're a terrible writer. But if someone put a gun to your head and said, you have to have your 100 page thesis done by next Monday, or I'll shoot you.
