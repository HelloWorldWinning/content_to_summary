**Vim 编辑器实用功能总结**

本视频介绍了 Vim 编辑器中一些可能不常用但非常实用的功能，旨在提升文本编辑和开发效率。视频强调了 Vim 模式本身的编辑效率，并在此基础上探讨了 Vim 编辑器提供的进阶功能。

**概述**

*   **核心观点：** Vim 提供了许多强大且常被忽视的功能，掌握它们可以显著提高文本编辑和开发效率，无需离开编辑器。
*   **总体框架：** 视频通过逐一介绍并演示 Vim 编辑器的特定功能，展示了如何利用这些内置工具和集成能力，更高效地处理文本、管理文件、执行重复任务、与外部系统交互以及进行定制配置。

**主要功能列表**

以下是视频中介绍的关键功能：

1.  **自动完成 (Autocomplete)**
    *   **操作：** 在插入模式下使用 `Ctrl+P` (previous) 或 `Ctrl+N` (next)。
    *   **说明：** 基于当前文件或打开的缓冲区中的文本进行词语或命令的自动完成。在输入长词或代码时特别有用。
2.  **缓冲区 (Buffers) 管理**
    *   **操作：** 使用 `:buffer next` 或 `:buffer previous` 在不同文件（缓冲区）之间切换；`:e new` 打开新缓冲区。可以通过 Vim 启动时指定多个文件作为参数打开。
    *   **说明：** 允许在单个 Vim 会话中同时管理多个文件，方便快速切换、比较内容、复制粘贴等。作者推荐使用自定义快捷键进行快速切换。
3.  **录制宏 (Recordings/Macros)**
    *   **操作：** 在 Normal 模式下按 `q` 接着按一个寄存器字母（如 `a`）开始录制，再按 `q` 结束。使用 `@` 接着寄存器字母（如 `@a`）执行宏。在 `@` 前加数字（如 `10@a`）可重复执行指定次数。
    *   **说明：** 录制一系列击键操作，然后重复执行，极大地自动化重复性编辑任务。通过精心设计录制内容（例如在结尾包含跳转下一行），可以方便地在多行上应用宏。
4.  **Normal 命令 (`:norm`/`:normal`)**
    *   **操作：** 在命令模式下输入 `:norm` 或 `:normal` 接着输入 Normal 模式下的命令。常与可视化模式选区结合使用（在选区后按 `:` 会自动带上行范围）。
    *   **说明：** 在 Vim 的命令模式下执行 Normal 模式的命令序列。特别强大的是可以对通过可视化模式选择的多行或文本块应用相同的 Normal 模式操作，实现批量编辑。
5.  **外部命令 (`:!`)**
    *   **操作：** 在命令模式下输入 `!` 接着输入系统命令（如 `cat filename` 或 `sort`）。可以与可视化模式选区结合，将选区内容作为输入传递给外部命令并用其输出替换选区。
    *   **说明：** 无需离开 Vim 即可执行 shell 命令。结合选区可以方便地利用系统工具（如 `sort`, `unique`, `grep` 等）对缓冲区中的文本进行处理。
6.  **跳转文件/URL (`gf`/`gx`)**
    *   **操作：** 光标放在文件路径上按 `gf`，光标放在 URL 上按 `gx`。
    *   **说明：** `gf` 会在新的缓冲区中打开光标下的文件路径（支持相对和绝对路径）。`gx` 会在系统默认浏览器中打开光标下的 URL。方便快速导航到相关文件或网页文档。
7.  **文件加密 (`:X`)**
    *   **操作：** 在命令模式下输入 `:X` 并回车， Vim 会提示输入密码。保存文件后，文件将以 Blowfish 加密存储。再次使用 `:X` 输入空密码可以移除加密。
    *   **说明：** 提供了一种基础的文件内容加密方式，保护敏感信息。
8.  **自动源/配置 (Auto-sourcing)**
    *   **操作：** 通过在 VimRC 配置文件中设置自动命令（autocmd）实现。例如，根据文件扩展名自动应用特定功能（如对 `.gpg` 文件自动调用 GPG 进行加密/解密）。
    *   **说明：** 展示了 Vim 强大的可定制性。用户可以配置 Vim 根据文件类型、名称等属性，在加载或保存文件时自动执行命令或应用设置，例如自动处理加密文件。
9.  **拼写检查 (`:set spell`)**
    *   **操作：** `:set spell` 开启拼写检查，`:set spelllang=` 设置语言。将光标放在标记的错误词上，按 `z=` 查看建议，按 `zg` 将单词添加到字典。
    *   **说明：** Vim 内置的拼写检查功能，可以高亮显示可能的拼写错误，并提供修改建议或允许将新词添加到字典，对撰写文本非常实用。也支持非常基础的语法检查。
10. **基本算术 (Basic Arithmetics)**
    *   **操作：** 在 Normal 模式下，将光标放在数字上按 `Ctrl+A` 增加数字，按 `Ctrl+X` 减少数字。可以与宏录制结合使用。
    *   **说明：** 允许快速递增或递减数字。结合宏可以方便地生成编号列表或调整序列号。
11. **额外：执行行作为 Shell 命令 (Custom Mapping)**
    *   **操作：** 作者使用自定义 Leader 键 + Enter 快捷键将当前行内容作为 Shell 命令执行。
    *   **说明：** 通过自定义配置实现，方便快速测试 shell 命令或利用 shell 执行一些简单计算（例如视频中演示的加法），无需离开 Vim。

to show you 10 vim features that want to show you 10 vim features that you probably didn't know yet you probably didn't know yet you probably didn't know yet you might know that i'm a big fan of vim you might know that i'm a big fan of vim you might know that i'm a big fan of vim and i use this editor pretty much every and i use this editor pretty much every and i use this editor pretty much every day but not just because well i'm not day but not just because well i'm not day but not just because well i'm not necessarily a fan of the editor but of necessarily a fan of the editor but of necessarily a fan of the editor but of this vim mode that is just really this vim mode that is just really this vim mode that is just really effective to edit text with but also effective to edit text with but also effective to edit text with but also there are some interesting features of there are some interesting features of there are some interesting features of the vim editor and a few of which i want the vim editor and a few of which i want the vim editor and a few of which i want to show you in this video and the first to show you in this video and the first to show you in this video and the first one one one that i want to show you is autocomplete that i want to show you is autocomplete that i want to show you is autocomplete so if you edit well any text or any so if you edit well any text or any so if you edit well any text or any thing in vim here you can actually just thing in vim here you can actually just thing in vim here you can actually just autocomplete your text in a way that you autocomplete your text in a way that you autocomplete your text in a way that you say well hello world say well hello world say well hello world control p or control n control p or control n control p or control n will just then autocomplete something will just then autocomplete something will just then autocomplete something there you can even there you can even there you can even browse through this so for example if browse through this so for example if browse through this so for example if you say you say you say hello and hi and hey hello and hi and hey hello and hi and hey and then if you press h then it will and then if you press h then it will and then if you press h then it will just just just give you a possibility to auto complete give you a possibility to auto complete give you a possibility to auto complete your words here it especially makes your words here it especially makes your words here it especially makes sense with some keyboards or the sense with some keyboards or the sense with some keyboards or the word of a method name or a variable name word of a method name or a variable name word of a method name or a variable name while you editing some coding but while you editing some coding but while you editing some coding but obviously for that you get into the area obviously for that you get into the area obviously for that you get into the area where using an ide makes more sense but where using an ide makes more sense but where using an ide makes more sense but it's sometimes it's helpful if you it's sometimes it's helpful if you it's sometimes it's helpful if you edit some text and if you have longer edit some text and if you have longer edit some text and if you have longer words words words such as asynchronous or something like such as asynchronous or something like such as asynchronous or something like that that then you know once you type that that then you know once you type that that then you know once you type once you can just auto complete faster once you can just auto complete faster once you can just auto complete faster so that's the first one it uses um so that's the first one it uses um so that's the first one it uses um control uh p and n for well the previous control uh p and n for well the previous control uh p and n for well the previous and the next match so you can browse and the next match so you can browse and the next match so you can browse through them i typically press ctrl through them i typically press ctrl through them i typically press ctrl p while i'm in p while i'm in p while i'm in insert mode and that works in this insert mode and that works in this insert mode and that works in this regard regard regard now the second one the second feature now the second one the second feature now the second one the second feature is using buffers is using buffers is using buffers so these are file buffers with which we so these are file buffers with which we so these are file buffers with which we can open multiple files uh well at once can open multiple files uh well at once can open multiple files uh well at once or in one session how this works is well or in one session how this works is well or in one session how this works is well you can have some commands for opening you can have some commands for opening you can have some commands for opening up multiple buffers but in the simplest up multiple buffers but in the simplest up multiple buffers but in the simplest way you just go way you just go way you just go and say well i would like to edit and say well i would like to edit and say well i would like to edit multiple multiple multiple files files files that of course don't need to exist here that of course don't need to exist here that of course don't need to exist here that you just provide as arguments when that you just provide as arguments when that you just provide as arguments when you start a bim and now you have this you start a bim and now you have this you start a bim and now you have this one available which then one available which then one available which then just gives you a possibility just gives you a possibility just gives you a possibility to to to browse through these files browse through these files browse through these files so you can then use a command so you can then use a command so you can then use a command buffer next buffer next buffer next or buffer previous or buffer previous or buffer previous in which you can change them so you say in which you can change them so you say in which you can change them so you say hello world file one hello world file one hello world file one and um and um and um hello world file two and then you can hello world file two and then you can hello world file two and then you can browse through them quite quickly so browse through them quite quickly so browse through them quite quickly so what you can do what you can do what you can do um you can have these commands buffer um you can have these commands buffer um you can have these commands buffer next buffer previous you can also use i next buffer previous you can also use i next buffer previous you can also use i think it's e new for opening up a new think it's e new for opening up a new think it's e new for opening up a new file and therefore in a in a new buffer file and therefore in a in a new buffer file and therefore in a in a new buffer i will also link you my dot files in the i will also link you my dot files in the i will also link you my dot files in the description down below because i usually description down below because i usually description down below because i usually don't type these as you've seen i use don't type these as you've seen i use don't type these as you've seen i use some shortcuts for them so for example i some shortcuts for them so for example i some shortcuts for them so for example i use my leader key and l and h for use my leader key and l and h for use my leader key and l and h for switching through these buffers and switching through these buffers and switching through these buffers and leader key t to well have a new leader key t to well have a new leader key t to well have a new and that is part of your so-called and that is part of your so-called and that is part of your so-called buffer list so you have just these files buffer list so you have just these files buffer list so you have just these files open and you can browse through them open and you can browse through them open and you can browse through them quite quickly which is just nice because quite quickly which is just nice because quite quickly which is just nice because then you can quickly compare the files then you can quickly compare the files then you can quickly compare the files that you have and also obviously copy that you have and also obviously copy that you have and also obviously copy and paste and paste and paste within them so buffers is just a very within them so buffers is just a very within them so buffers is just a very nice way to handle multiple files and to nice way to handle multiple files and to nice way to handle multiple files and to keep keep them open and also to you know keep keep them open and also to you know keep keep them open and also to you know open this up so just if you use you open this up so just if you use you open this up so just if you use you might want to get familiar with might want to get familiar with might want to get familiar with this thing of buffers if you want to this thing of buffers if you want to this thing of buffers if you want to close a buffer it is with b and d close a buffer it is with b and d close a buffer it is with b and d or exclamation mark to override if you or exclamation mark to override if you or exclamation mark to override if you have some changes so you can do in this way and then close so you can do in this way and then close so you can do in this way and then close that again so that's another just that again so that's another just that again so that's another just helpful feature helpful feature helpful feature as the next feature that you maybe as the next feature that you maybe as the next feature that you maybe hopefully even know about is recordings hopefully even know about is recordings hopefully even know about is recordings so recordings are really helpful when we so recordings are really helpful when we so recordings are really helpful when we edit some more advanced text and i've edit some more advanced text and i've edit some more advanced text and i've been showing this on my youtube channel been showing this on my youtube channel been showing this on my youtube channel before you might want to have a look before you might want to have a look before you might want to have a look at a previous session where i at a previous session where i at a previous session where i specifically use this feature specifically use this feature specifically use this feature what it does is what it does is what it does is that i say well if i have some that i say well if i have some that i say well if i have some change here for example for the second change here for example for the second change here for example for the second word i want to make this uppercase or word i want to make this uppercase or word i want to make this uppercase or let's say i want to have both words let's say i want to have both words let's say i want to have both words uppercase something like this uppercase something like this uppercase something like this so i have hello world goodbye world hey so i have hello world goodbye world hey so i have hello world goodbye world hey world and so on and so forth and this a world and so on and so forth and this a world and so on and so forth and this a few times few times few times so to edit this this can become quite so to edit this this can become quite so to edit this this can become quite cumbersome but with this recording cumbersome but with this recording cumbersome but with this recording feature this works quite well feature this works quite well feature this works quite well by pressing q and then some key for a by pressing q and then some key for a by pressing q and then some key for a register a for example then you see that register a for example then you see that register a for example then you see that now it's recording there and you can do now it's recording there and you can do now it's recording there and you can do a few things and you can do basically a few things and you can do basically a few things and you can do basically anything you like so let's say we make anything you like so let's say we make anything you like so let's say we make this uppercase we jump to the end this uppercase we jump to the end this uppercase we jump to the end exclamation mark and then we go to the exclamation mark and then we go to the exclamation mark and then we go to the front again and one down so you already front again and one down so you already front again and one down so you already have to think of well how do i want to have to think of well how do i want to have to think of well how do i want to do and end the recording in order to be do and end the recording in order to be do and end the recording in order to be repeatable afterwards why because now if repeatable afterwards why because now if repeatable afterwards why because now if i press q again the recording is i press q again the recording is i press q again the recording is finished and i can just very quickly finished and i can just very quickly finished and i can just very quickly execute that again by pressing at execute that again by pressing at execute that again by pressing at and then well the key for the recording and then well the key for the recording and then well the key for the recording so at a in this case so at a in this case so at a in this case so in that way i can say well really so in that way i can say well really so in that way i can say well really quickly do this but even that is too quickly do this but even that is too quickly do this but even that is too slow because it's a lot of work to slow because it's a lot of work to slow because it's a lot of work to do this so instead i can say well apply do this so instead i can say well apply do this so instead i can say well apply this but not only once but in this case this but not only once but in this case this but not only once but in this case for example for example for example 13 times so i say 1 3 at a 13 times so i say 1 3 at a 13 times so i say 1 3 at a and that was just much faster to apply and that was just much faster to apply and that was just much faster to apply them all at once so here again once i them all at once so here again once i them all at once so here again once i have like these are 13 lines down below have like these are 13 lines down below have like these are 13 lines down below so i can have this for 14 times to do so i can have this for 14 times to do so i can have this for 14 times to do all at once 1 4 at a all at once 1 4 at a all at once 1 4 at a and that will just apply all of them and that will just apply all of them and that will just apply all of them immediately so how this works is just immediately so how this works is just immediately so how this works is just pressing q for start to recording and pressing q for start to recording and pressing q for start to recording and then some key for example a or b or c then some key for example a or b or c then some key for example a or b or c for some register and then in order to for some register and then in order to for some register and then in order to end it you press q again so you do end it you press q again so you do end it you press q again so you do anything here in between anything here in between anything here in between and then with at a you can apply it once and then with at a you can apply it once and then with at a you can apply it once or some number before to apply it multiple times number before to apply it multiple times number before to apply it multiple times this is why i ended it one line below so this is why i ended it one line below so this is why i ended it one line below so that it always like jumps down for that it always like jumps down for that it always like jumps down for example but this is very flexible to do example but this is very flexible to do example but this is very flexible to do all sorts of editing and in general a all sorts of editing and in general a all sorts of editing and in general a very helpful feature very helpful feature very helpful feature for the next feature i want to show you for the next feature i want to show you for the next feature i want to show you this norm or normal command that you can this norm or normal command that you can this norm or normal command that you can execute with this colon so if you do execute with this colon so if you do execute with this colon so if you do some stuff some stuff some stuff and then you press this colon then you and then you press this colon then you and then you press this colon then you can write something here can write something here can write something here and you can execute some commands for and you can execute some commands for and you can execute some commands for example norm that's typically what i example norm that's typically what i example norm that's typically what i type which is short for normal for type which is short for normal for type which is short for normal for normal mode which will just execute normal mode which will just execute normal mode which will just execute something in a normal mode something in a normal mode something in a normal mode for example normal mode i can do for example normal mode i can do for example normal mode i can do something so i now can type any key that something so i now can type any key that something so i now can type any key that i typically would type in my bim and i typically would type in my bim and i typically would type in my bim and then i can do something for example i then i can do something for example i then i can do something for example i for insert and then say hello for insert and then say hello for insert and then say hello and just execute this so then it will and just execute this so then it will and just execute this so then it will just write hello now you might think just write hello now you might think just write hello now you might think okay that's somewhat silly what does okay that's somewhat silly what does okay that's somewhat silly what does that bring me well quite easy you can that bring me well quite easy you can that bring me well quite easy you can actually do this for actually do this for actually do this for um also applying things in multiple uh um also applying things in multiple uh um also applying things in multiple uh times so assuming i have a lot of lines times so assuming i have a lot of lines times so assuming i have a lot of lines here and i always want to have a single here and i always want to have a single here and i always want to have a single character or some single form of editing character or some single form of editing character or some single form of editing for all of these lines what works really for all of these lines what works really for all of these lines what works really nicely is if i say i want to select all nicely is if i say i want to select all nicely is if i say i want to select all of them in the visual line mode and then of them in the visual line mode and then of them in the visual line mode and then i can press this colon and type norm or i can press this colon and type norm or i can press this colon and type norm or normal and then for example a for jump normal and then for example a for jump normal and then for example a for jump at the end of the line and at the end of the line and at the end of the line and append it there append it there append it there exclamation mark which then says hello exclamation mark which then says hello exclamation mark which then says hello world exclamation mark for all of these world exclamation mark for all of these world exclamation mark for all of these lines so for example this works really lines so for example this works really lines so for example this works really well if i um want to add some well well if i um want to add some well well if i um want to add some well invocation here invocation here invocation here for example norm and then go to the for example norm and then go to the for example norm and then go to the beginning uppercase i beginning uppercase i beginning uppercase i say for example call say for example call say for example call brackets and then some quotes some double quotes and do the quotes some double quotes and do the quotes some double quotes and do the same thing again same thing again same thing again at the end at the end at the end something like this where you can very something like this where you can very something like this where you can very quickly then add some invocation this is quickly then add some invocation this is quickly then add some invocation this is what i'm doing quite often if i have what i'm doing quite often if i have what i'm doing quite often if i have many statements i will copy them over many statements i will copy them over many statements i will copy them over into whim and then i edit this just in a into whim and then i edit this just in a into whim and then i edit this just in a very simple way using this normal very simple way using this normal very simple way using this normal command so it in general just executes command so it in general just executes command so it in general just executes anything that you uh anything that you uh anything that you uh tell it to here so for example if i tell it to here so for example if i tell it to here so for example if i would um remove the end again i could go would um remove the end again i could go would um remove the end again i could go and say well norm jump to the end with and say well norm jump to the end with and say well norm jump to the end with dollar and then what i can do i can say dollar and then what i can do i can say dollar and then what i can do i can say well delete maybe the last character the well delete maybe the last character the well delete maybe the last character the semicolon so just make an x for delete semicolon so just make an x for delete semicolon so just make an x for delete that so go to the last position and then that so go to the last position and then that so go to the last position and then delete this and i can remove that again delete this and i can remove that again delete this and i can remove that again for example so this is what works quite for example so this is what works quite for example so this is what works quite nicely i'm using this norm or normal nicely i'm using this norm or normal nicely i'm using this norm or normal command and then with anything that you command and then with anything that you command and then with anything that you would otherwise just have in your normal would otherwise just have in your normal would otherwise just have in your normal mode in them and that would just be mode in them and that would just be mode in them and that would just be executed and works quite nicely with the executed and works quite nicely with the executed and works quite nicely with the visual selection to be executed for each visual selection to be executed for each visual selection to be executed for each line line line as a next thing i want to show you this as a next thing i want to show you this as a next thing i want to show you this way of executing some commands some way of executing some commands some way of executing some commands some external commands which are actually the external commands which are actually the external commands which are actually the same commands that you would run on your same commands that you would run on your same commands that you would run on your command line so for example i can say exclamation mark and then uh for exclamation mark and then uh for exclamation mark and then uh for instance a cat and then some file so if instance a cat and then some file so if instance a cat and then some file so if i would um create i don't know i would um create i don't know i would um create i don't know some file tem some file tem some file tem do we do we do we have file hello world for example this have file hello world for example this have file hello world for example this then i could say well just then i could say well just then i could say well just actually actually actually emit this here emit this here emit this here and then and then and then it would just show this it would just show this it would just show this i can show you again i can show you again i can show you again will show the hello world now in this will show the hello world now in this will show the hello world now in this case it doesn't really make sense but it case it doesn't really make sense but it case it doesn't really make sense but it depends what the command does so if the depends what the command does so if the depends what the command does so if the command works with input and output then command works with input and output then command works with input and output then you can actually edit something here in you can actually edit something here in you can actually edit something here in your files so for example for your files so for example for your files so for example for hello world hello world hello world you have something like goodbye world you have something like goodbye world you have something like goodbye world and again hey world and hi world and again hey world and hi world and again hey world and hi world and now i would like to sort all of and now i would like to sort all of and now i would like to sort all of these lines so what you can do you these lines so what you can do you these lines so what you can do you select them and then press colon select them and then press colon select them and then press colon exclamation mark sort which is a unix exclamation mark sort which is a unix exclamation mark sort which is a unix functionality that then will just sort functionality that then will just sort functionality that then will just sort all of them here all of them here all of them here or you say or you say or you say you do this exclamation mark sort and you do this exclamation mark sort and you do this exclamation mark sort and then unique i think it is so for just then unique i think it is so for just then unique i think it is so for just making them unique and sorted here in making them unique and sorted here in making them unique and sorted here in that case so you can then use and that case so you can then use and that case so you can then use and combine some unix commands that you combine some unix commands that you combine some unix commands that you would use on the command line and would use on the command line and would use on the command line and obviously you can also then call any obviously you can also then call any obviously you can also then call any arbitrary command so for example while arbitrary command so for example while arbitrary command so for example while you're coding or editing text you're coding or editing text you're coding or editing text you can just execute some command and you can just execute some command and you can just execute some command and you don't have to switch the windows you don't have to switch the windows you don't have to switch the windows here so that works especially well when here so that works especially well when here so that works especially well when you use the result in order to work with you use the result in order to work with you use the result in order to work with your text and your text selection so your text and your text selection so your text and your text selection so that's quite helpful that's quite helpful that's quite helpful and the syntax is just the colon again and the syntax is just the colon again and the syntax is just the colon again and then some exclamation mark and the and then some exclamation mark and the and then some exclamation mark and the command that you would like to execute command that you would like to execute command that you would like to execute and then obviously you can combine and then obviously you can combine and then obviously you can combine this with some shell scripting or other this with some shell scripting or other this with some shell scripting or other mechanisms that work with your mechanisms that work with your mechanisms that work with your input and output in order to modify input and output in order to modify input and output in order to modify something so that's quite helpful as something so that's quite helpful as something so that's quite helpful as well especially the default sorting well especially the default sorting well especially the default sorting functionalities and so on by of unix functionalities and so on by of unix functionalities and so on by of unix then what is also kind of cool is that then what is also kind of cool is that then what is also kind of cool is that you can you can you can open some files and urls with open some files and urls with open some files and urls with gf and gx that you can do here so for gf and gx that you can do here so for gf and gx that you can do here so for example if i write example if i write example if i write just the path of this just the path of this just the path of this of a file of a different file so this of a file of a different file so this of a file of a different file so this one is now not a file yet that's just one is now not a file yet that's just one is now not a file yet that's just you know i opened up a new buffer you know i opened up a new buffer you know i opened up a new buffer but then i can open and follow this by but then i can open and follow this by but then i can open and follow this by pressing gf pressing gf pressing gf sorry sorry sorry gf gf gf and then now it will open this up in a and then now it will open this up in a and then now it will open this up in a new buffer so now i have this file open new buffer so now i have this file open new buffer so now i have this file open which is quite helpful even if you have which is quite helpful even if you have which is quite helpful even if you have some some some text-based documentation on your local text-based documentation on your local text-based documentation on your local file system you can pretty much have a file system you can pretty much have a file system you can pretty much have a pointer to another file in an absolute pointer to another file in an absolute pointer to another file in an absolute or in a relative path and then you just or in a relative path and then you just or in a relative path and then you just open this up by providing it like that open this up by providing it like that open this up by providing it like that so gf will just then jump to this file so gf will just then jump to this file so gf will just then jump to this file basically the same works if you have basically the same works if you have basically the same works if you have some some some url here url here url here so gx will just open this up in a so gx will just open this up in a so gx will just open this up in a browser and then you know you can browser and then you know you can browser and then you know you can quickly jump to some specific site which quickly jump to some specific site which quickly jump to some specific site which is also kind of cool so just these work is also kind of cool so just these work is also kind of cool so just these work quite nicely by providing these links quite nicely by providing these links quite nicely by providing these links and then following them so it's gf for and then following them so it's gf for and then following them so it's gf for files and gx for urls for files it works files and gx for urls for files it works files and gx for urls for files it works in both absolute and relative path in both absolute and relative path in both absolute and relative path manner manner manner another another another thing that you probably didn't know you thing that you probably didn't know you thing that you probably didn't know you can actually encrypt files in vim by can actually encrypt files in vim by can actually encrypt files in vim by using this colon uppercase x command using this colon uppercase x command using this colon uppercase x command which is quite interesting so now let's which is quite interesting so now let's which is quite interesting so now let's say i open up my say i open up my say i open up my file again let me file again let me file again let me quickly quickly quickly close this this was file close this this was file close this this was file text hello world text hello world text hello world and now i go and say colon uppercase x and now i go and say colon uppercase x and now i go and say colon uppercase x enter and then it tells me to enter some enter and then it tells me to enter some enter and then it tells me to enter some encryption key encryption key encryption key for example one two three and repeat for example one two three and repeat for example one two three and repeat that that that and now this is actually stored in an and now this is actually stored in an and now this is actually stored in an encrypted way so if i press save now it encrypted way so if i press save now it encrypted way so if i press save now it would be written with this blowfish would be written with this blowfish would be written with this blowfish encryption encryption encryption utility and now if i would like to read utility and now if i would like to read utility and now if i would like to read it you see okay now it's encrypted here it you see okay now it's encrypted here it you see okay now it's encrypted here but of course with wim it works but of course with wim it works but of course with wim it works but obviously you need to provide this but obviously you need to provide this but obviously you need to provide this encryption key encryption key encryption key and then and then and then while you can edit and write it again if while you can edit and write it again if while you can edit and write it again if you would like to remove it you would like to remove it you would like to remove it you use this again i'm calling uppercase you use this again i'm calling uppercase you use this again i'm calling uppercase x to change the password and if it's um x to change the password and if it's um x to change the password and if it's um if the key is empty then it won't be if the key is empty then it won't be if the key is empty then it won't be encrypted so then it's just encrypted so then it's just encrypted so then it's just the plain text again the plain text again the plain text again so that's kind of cool you use so that's kind of cool you use so that's kind of cool you use uppercase x colon x to encrypt some uppercase x colon x to encrypt some uppercase x colon x to encrypt some files files files what is connected to that is another what is connected to that is another what is connected to that is another functionality that you can use in a very functionality that you can use in a very functionality that you can use in a very interesting way which is so-called auto interesting way which is so-called auto interesting way which is so-called auto source source source well not really a command but a well not really a command but a well not really a command but a functionality that you can use in your functionality that you can use in your functionality that you can use in your vim rc file so that it can set up vim rc file so that it can set up vim rc file so that it can set up in a way and again i will in a way and again i will in a way and again i will link my dot files which point to this so link my dot files which point to this so link my dot files which point to this so i have some well i have i have some well i have i have some well i have this for some testing purposes for some this for some testing purposes for some this for some testing purposes for some syntax file but the one i wanted to show syntax file but the one i wanted to show syntax file but the one i wanted to show you is that you can have with encryption you is that you can have with encryption you is that you can have with encryption so now let me just quickly search this so now let me just quickly search this so now let me just quickly search this here here here that is that is that is yeah a similar yeah a similar yeah a similar auto source command for just encrypted auto source command for just encrypted auto source command for just encrypted files so you can combine this with a files so you can combine this with a files so you can combine this with a file extension and for me for example if file extension and for me for example if file extension and for me for example if i use i use i use a gpg a gpg a gpg extension then it will also be written extension then it will also be written extension then it will also be written in my case in my case in my case by the gpg functionality which in my by the gpg functionality which in my by the gpg functionality which in my case uses actually my key that i can case uses actually my key that i can case uses actually my key that i can provide so it's a little bit different provide so it's a little bit different provide so it's a little bit different to what i just showed so for example if to what i just showed so for example if to what i just showed so for example if i say i say i say file. txt. gpg file. txt. gpg file. txt. gpg then i say hello world i can save it then i say hello world i can save it then i say hello world i can save it and now it looks a little bit and now it looks a little bit and now it looks a little bit differently but it was actually differently but it was actually differently but it was actually encrypted using my key encrypted using my key encrypted using my key and then you will see that this file is and then you will see that this file is and then you will see that this file is actually there in an encrypted way actually there in an encrypted way actually there in an encrypted way where then well you cannot read it where then well you cannot read it where then well you cannot read it immediately but immediately but immediately but if you open it up with bim in the same if you open it up with bim in the same if you open it up with bim in the same way it would read your key it would way it would read your key it would way it would read your key it would optionally ask you for your passphrase optionally ask you for your passphrase optionally ask you for your passphrase of the key and then decrypt it again so of the key and then decrypt it again so of the key and then decrypt it again so that's just another different way that's just another different way that's just another different way and this also works with the combination and this also works with the combination and this also works with the combination of some some other functionalities for of some some other functionalities for of some some other functionalities for example the syntax highlighting um if example the syntax highlighting um if example the syntax highlighting um if it's a it's a it's a file. json. gpg and and things like that file. json. gpg and and things like that file. json. gpg and and things like that so i will link uh so i will link uh so i will link uh for the dot files where how you can for the dot files where how you can for the dot files where how you can include this yourself but auto sourcing include this yourself but auto sourcing include this yourself but auto sourcing is just another interesting feature or is just another interesting feature or is just another interesting feature or way in which you can really customize way in which you can really customize way in which you can really customize and the experience that you get with wim and the experience that you get with wim and the experience that you get with wim when loading and saving files when loading and saving files when loading and saving files and another thing that i want to show and another thing that i want to show and another thing that i want to show you that you probably know you that you probably know you that you probably know wim has a spell checking a mechanism wim has a spell checking a mechanism wim has a spell checking a mechanism built in so if you built in so if you built in so if you set this for me i also have some set this for me i also have some set this for me i also have some of functionality some shortcut for it so of functionality some shortcut for it so of functionality some shortcut for it so set spell and then you can set some set spell and then you can set some set spell and then you can set some spell language for example english here spell language for example english here spell language for example english here then we'll just we'll have some then we'll just we'll have some then we'll just we'll have some spell checking here that will just spell checking here that will just spell checking here that will just highlight some words so then if you go highlight some words so then if you go highlight some words so then if you go and for example press it's a z and then and for example press it's a z and then and for example press it's a z and then equals sign it will actually will just equals sign it will actually will just equals sign it will actually will just provide some provide some provide some provide some suggestions if you have a provide some suggestions if you have a provide some suggestions if you have a spelling mistake what this would be now spelling mistake what this would be now spelling mistake what this would be now with this latin lorem ipsum it doesn't with this latin lorem ipsum it doesn't with this latin lorem ipsum it doesn't really make sense really make sense really make sense but if i just have some but if i just have some but if i just have some some other spelling mistake if i just some other spelling mistake if i just some other spelling mistake if i just press this then it will just suggest press this then it will just suggest press this then it will just suggest something and then i can then i can something and then i can then i can something and then i can then i can press of course i want goodbye so i say press of course i want goodbye so i say press of course i want goodbye so i say it should be one and then i change this it should be one and then i change this it should be one and then i change this here and this also um has another here and this also um has another here and this also um has another of um functionality for grammar checking of um functionality for grammar checking of um functionality for grammar checking at least very very basic one so here for at least very very basic one so here for at least very very basic one so here for example it says well that should be the example it says well that should be the example it says well that should be the beginning of a sentence so please make beginning of a sentence so please make beginning of a sentence so please make this uppercase and things like that so this uppercase and things like that so this uppercase and things like that so it does have this as well it does have this as well it does have this as well but just a very basic spell checking is but just a very basic spell checking is but just a very basic spell checking is helpful when you're writing some text helpful when you're writing some text helpful when you're writing some text and just for the and just for the and just for the functionality of functionality of functionality of including this here including this here including this here of just seeing well the obvious mistakes of just seeing well the obvious mistakes of just seeing well the obvious mistakes that you did that you did that you did and for the other purpose what you can and for the other purpose what you can and for the other purpose what you can also do if you have some also do if you have some also do if you have some let's see microservice something like let's see microservice something like let's see microservice something like that well it knows about these words but that well it knows about these words but that well it knows about these words but if you had some functionality like well if you had some functionality like well if you had some functionality like well i don't know what you would like to i don't know what you would like to i don't know what you would like to include for example json but for me i include for example json but for me i include for example json but for me i already added them so let's say already added them so let's say already added them so let's say p yes that is not p yes that is not p yes that is not known if it has some unknown word that known if it has some unknown word that known if it has some unknown word that you would like to add to your you would like to add to your you would like to add to your dictionary you press c and g and then it dictionary you press c and g and then it dictionary you press c and g and then it will be added to this particular will be added to this particular will be added to this particular language and then you know jsonp for language and then you know jsonp for language and then you know jsonp for example will be a known word for that example will be a known word for that example will be a known word for that regard so this is just a very basic regard so this is just a very basic regard so this is just a very basic functionality how spell checking works functionality how spell checking works functionality how spell checking works in vim which is quite helpful if you're in vim which is quite helpful if you're in vim which is quite helpful if you're writing text writing text writing text another helpful more like fun fact but another helpful more like fun fact but another helpful more like fun fact but i've used it once or twice is that them i've used it once or twice is that them i've used it once or twice is that them can do very basic arithmetics so for can do very basic arithmetics so for can do very basic arithmetics so for example you can example you can example you can increment and decrement some integer increment and decrement some integer increment and decrement some integer values so for example if i say values so for example if i say values so for example if i say 1 2 3 2 3 4 1 2 3 2 3 4 1 2 3 2 3 4 if i press if i press if i press ctrl a ctrl a ctrl a it will jump to the next integer and it will jump to the next integer and it will jump to the next integer and just just just increment it increment it increment it and control and control and control x will decrement it so if i go here then x will decrement it so if i go here then x will decrement it so if i go here then it will jump to the next one and so on it will jump to the next one and so on it will jump to the next one and so on and so forth which sometimes can be and so forth which sometimes can be and so forth which sometimes can be helpful if you combine it with some helpful if you combine it with some helpful if you combine it with some other other other automation command for example i say automation command for example i say automation command for example i say well well well do this i would like to have some do this i would like to have some do this i would like to have some list with some some numbered list list with some some numbered list list with some some numbered list i say use this recording feature that we i say use this recording feature that we i say use this recording feature that we had before copy the current line had before copy the current line had before copy the current line paste it to uh the next line and then paste it to uh the next line and then paste it to uh the next line and then increment it ctrl a by once and now ends increment it ctrl a by once and now ends increment it ctrl a by once and now ends the recording and now play the recording the recording and now play the recording the recording and now play the recording at a again and play it 10 times 10 at a at a again and play it 10 times 10 at a at a again and play it 10 times 10 at a and then you have something like a and then you have something like a and then you have something like a numbered list so sometimes that can be numbered list so sometimes that can be numbered list so sometimes that can be um an interesting feature by just using um an interesting feature by just using um an interesting feature by just using these arithmetic these arithmetic these arithmetic arithmetics arithmetics arithmetics in a different way what you can also do in a different way what you can also do in a different way what you can also do so that's so that's so that's quite interesting now just as a bonus quite interesting now just as a bonus quite interesting now just as a bonus i've been showing this before i've been showing this before i've been showing this before on my channels you can actually include on my channels you can actually include on my channels you can actually include and combine these features with some and combine these features with some and combine these features with some other mechanism to execute them with a other mechanism to execute them with a other mechanism to execute them with a keyboard for example i can say well keyboard for example i can say well keyboard for example i can say well write something that should be a command write something that should be a command write something that should be a command and then in my case i have a special and then in my case i have a special and then in my case i have a special binding if i press the leader key and binding if i press the leader key and binding if i press the leader key and enter enter enter it will just execute this in my shell it will just execute this in my shell it will just execute this in my shell now for echo that's kind of boring but now for echo that's kind of boring but now for echo that's kind of boring but for example what i can say will do some for example what i can say will do some for example what i can say will do some more arithmetics so what a shell for more arithmetics so what a shell for more arithmetics so what a shell for example can do now press this leader enter and then it now press this leader enter and then it now press this leader enter and then it will well that was boring then we'll execute this then we'll execute this then we'll execute this and just calculate the results so this and just calculate the results so this and just calculate the results so this is sometimes helpful if for example i is sometimes helpful if for example i is sometimes helpful if for example i say i have some list here and then in say i have some list here and then in say i have some list here and then in this case that doesn't really make sense this case that doesn't really make sense this case that doesn't really make sense but assuming that it would like to have but assuming that it would like to have but assuming that it would like to have just these numbers just these numbers just these numbers and and and let's say i want to remove them and now i would like to add them all together add them all together add them all together so what i do now i combine multiple so what i do now i combine multiple so what i do now i combine multiple things that you just learned i say well things that you just learned i say well things that you just learned i say well have some plus command remove the last have some plus command remove the last have some plus command remove the last one one one take them all in the visual mode press j take them all in the visual mode press j take them all in the visual mode press j to join the lines to join the lines to join the lines and then and then and then jump the beginning and say jump the beginning and say jump the beginning and say please write something that could be please write something that could be please write something that could be interpreted as a shell command press interpreted as a shell command press interpreted as a shell command press leader key and enter and now i have them leader key and enter and now i have them leader key and enter and now i have them all added together so now this was just all added together so now this was just all added together so now this was just a a a short demo of adding some features here short demo of adding some features here short demo of adding some features here together with this arithmetics and some together with this arithmetics and some together with this arithmetics and some other features that are maybe not that other features that are maybe not that other features that are maybe not that known in vim and that you can use known in vim and that you can use known in vim and that you can use sometimes because they're helpful and sometimes because they're helpful and sometimes because they're helpful and just kind of cool to show off just kind of cool to show off just kind of cool to show off your vim skills so i hope this was your vim skills so i hope this was your vim skills so i hope this was interesting if you're interested in more interesting if you're interested in more interesting if you're interested in more of these sort of tips especially on how of these sort of tips especially on how of these sort of
