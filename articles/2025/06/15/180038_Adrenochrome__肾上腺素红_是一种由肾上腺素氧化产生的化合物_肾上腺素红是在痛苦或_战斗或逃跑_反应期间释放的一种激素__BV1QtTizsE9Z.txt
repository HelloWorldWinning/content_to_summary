**总结大纲 (Summary Outline)**

1.  **引言：**
    *   承认主题（肾上腺色素、共济会、MK-Ultra）常被视为阴谋论。
    *   强调文本基于事实、研究、解密记录和论文。
    *   旨在证明这些联系。
2.  **肾上腺色素的发现与早期研究：**
    *   厄恩斯特·阿尔伯特·赫尔曼·弗里德海姆（Ernst Albert Herman Friedheim）：1933年通过氧化肾上腺素发现红色化合物，观察到生理反应。
    *   大卫·以斯拉·格林与德里克·里克特（David Ezra Green & Derek Richter）：1937年正式命名“Adrenochrome”（肾上腺的颜色）。
    *   肾上腺素的独特性：首个可从动物提取并在动物间通用的非植物源药物。
    *   肾上腺色素的本质：肾上腺素分解产物，进一步分解产生肾上腺素黄（adrenaluten）和黑色素。
    *   争议根源：来自血液的特性，连接古老血魔法与现代科学。
    *   疑问：为何争议不涉及肾上腺素？与共济会/MK-Ultra有何关系？
3.  **科学研究：精神分裂症与致幻效应：**
    *   奥斯蒙德与霍弗（Osmond & Hoffer）：1959年论文《精神分裂症的小研究》。
    *   精神分裂症的严重描述，“毒素 X”（荣格语）。
    *   观察到精神分裂症与麦司卡林体验相似。
    *   听闻大量肾上腺素引起幻觉的案例。
    *   假设体内存在麦司卡林类物质（M物质），关注肾上腺素衍生物（包括肾上腺色素）。
    *   二战期间使用粉色肾上腺素导致幻觉的观察。
    *   1952年：奥斯蒙德与霍弗在自身及他人身上测试肾上腺色素，观察到思维、感知、情绪的细微变化，类似早期精神分裂症。
    *   1954年：测试肾上腺素黄，效果持久但难处理。
    *   结论：肾上腺色素具有致幻效应。
    *   额外发现：服用LSD会导致体内肾上腺色素增加。
    *   研究瓶颈：资金匮乏。
4.  **机构关联：苏格兰礼共济会与MK-Ultra：**
    *   苏格兰礼北管辖区最高委员会33度：1934年起资助“早发性痴呆”（精神分裂症）研究。
    *   梅尔文·M·约翰逊（Melvin M. Johnson）与诺兰·唐·卡彭特-刘易斯（Nolan Don Carpentier-Lewis）。
    *   1934-1975年资助200+项目，约3000万美元（通胀调整后）。
    *   关键事件：1953年，刘易斯代表苏格兰礼资助并组织奥斯蒙德与霍弗在华尔道夫酒店的首次肾上腺色素假说报告会。
    *   证实肾上腺色素在动物（蜘蛛、鱼、鸽子、鼠、猫、狗、猴、人）测试中的一致活性。
    *   刘易斯与霍弗成为同事和朋友。
    *   尤恩·卡梅伦（Ewen Cameron）：因CIA MK-Ultra下的“精神驱动”研究闻名，与刘易斯、霍弗有联系。
    *   MK-Ultra联系：解密视频中科学家提到实验物质Mer 17可中和致幻剂，并提及研究“麦司卡林、大麻、eunuchrome（肾上腺色素）等遗传药物”。
    *   证明政府曾将肾上腺色素视为与麦司卡林、LSD同等的致幻剂。
5.  **进入流行文化与神话：**
    *   **奥尔德斯·赫胥黎（Aldous Huxley）：**
        *   1953年首次麦司卡林体验（由奥斯蒙德提供）。
        *   启发《知觉之门》（The Doors of Perception, 1954），书中明确提及肾上腺色素，指出其化学结构与麦司卡林、肾上腺素、LSD的关联。
        *   提出肾上腺色素可能在人体内自发产生。
    *   **安东尼·伯吉斯（Anthony Burgess）：**
        *   受赫胥黎（《美丽新世界》）的深刻影响。
        *   1962年小说《发条橙》（A Clockwork Orange）的纳萨特语中提及“Drenchrome”，与合成麦司卡林（Synth Mesc）并列，暗示其受赫胥黎《知觉之门》影响。
    *   **斯坦利·库布里克（Stanley Kubrick）：**
        *   1971年将《发条橙》改编为电影，片中出现“Drenkrum”字样，成为肾上腺色素在电影电视中的首次知名公开引用。
    *   **特里·索瑟恩（Terry Southern）：**
        *   1967年短篇小说《假发的血》（The Blood of a Wig），暗指精神分裂症患者的血（“Skitzo Juice”，“Red Split”）含肾上腺色素。
        *   描述注射后体验捐赠者特质（疯狂、亚洲感），连接古老血魔法和吸收特质的概念（后与松果体相关）。
    *   **亨特·S·汤普森（Hunter S. Thompson）：**
        *   1971年小说《拉斯维加斯的恐惧与厌恶》（Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas）。
        *   将肾上腺色素描述为比麦司卡林强力得多的致幻剂，“来自活体人类肾上腺”，“新鲜的更好”，与“撒旦教怪人”、人血联系。
    *   **关键人物链条（霍弗/奥斯蒙德 -> 赫胥黎 -> 伯吉斯/库布里克 -> 索瑟恩/汤普森）：**
        *   确立了关于肾上腺色素的四种传闻：强大致幻剂、新鲜更好、年轻动物来源更好、与松果体相关。
    *   **其他流行文化提及：**

6.  **后期研究与霍弗的回顾：**
    *   霍弗1994年论文《精神分裂症：对抗严重压力的进化防御》。
    *   霍弗仍认为肾上腺色素/肾上腺素黄是精神分裂症的原因（毒素X）。
    *   惊人论断：高水平肾上腺色素可能与“不老泉”有关——精神分裂症患者的一级亲属可能在身体（更年轻、白发少、少自身免疫病、更耐痛、抗感染、少癌症）和智力（更有创造力、成为顶尖人才）上有优势。
    *   惊人论断2：LSD的致幻效应可能源于扰乱肾上腺素代谢，需要肾上腺色素协同作用才能产生完整的迷幻体验（否则LSD单独导致焦虑）。
7.  **结论：**
    *   肾上腺色素：一种自然存在、争议大、研究不足的化学物质，现已成为众多虚构作品的核心。
    *   从1930年代与苏格兰礼共济会的联系开始，经由1950年代CIA MK-Ultra的补充，最终被“注入”流行文化主流。

**核心结论句 (Core Point - One Sentence)**

肾上腺色素从一个由早期科学研究发现并被苏格兰礼共济会资助的精神疾病假说相关物质，通过与CIA MK-Ultra项目的边缘联系，演变成流行文化中一个强大的、带有黑暗和超自然色彩的神话符号。

---

**整体框架 (Overarching Framework)**

该文本追溯了“肾上腺色素”这一概念在科学、机构和流行文化领域的发展和传播轨迹。它始于纯粹的生物化学发现，随后与精神疾病研究（特别是精神分裂症的毒素假说）产生关联，并获得了特定机构（苏格兰礼共济会）的资助，甚至触及了秘密政府项目（MK-Ultra）的边缘。然而，其知名度和围绕它的争议与神话主要通过文学、电影和其他媒体的传播而爆发，最终在流行文化中形成了一个与早期科学认知部分脱节、充满虚构元素的概念。整体框架是一个从**科学事实/假说** -> **机构资助/ covert联系** -> **流行文化传播/神话构建**的演变过程。

 Adrenochrome, 33rd degree Scottish Rite Freemasonry and CIA Mind Control. Now, I understand your initial skepticism. These topics often get dismissed as mere conspiracy theories. But rest assured, what you're about to see is a meticulously researched presentation that sticks to facts. No wild speculation, no unfounded claims. This is a serious investigation, and we're going to see names, dates, declassified records and research papers which proves this connection between Adrenochrome, Freemasonry and MK-Ultra, beyond any shadow of doubt to even the most skeptical. Dr Ernst Albert Herman Friedheim is credited with saving millions of lives with his cancer and tropical disease research. Perhaps lesser known is his role in the discovery of adrenochrome. In 1933, Dr Friedheim found that the respiration of rabbits' red blood cells increased by 50% after adding of a red compound obtained by oxidizing adrenaline. This red compound that he created by mixing adrenaline with silver oxide is perhaps the first documented experiment with adrenochrome, just not by name. His study states there was a very real and measurable physiological reaction when an animal was given adrenochrome. The name adrenochrome translates to Colour of the Adrenal, explained by Friedheim's description of the red compound created from adrenaline. The word adrenochrome was coined as early as March of 1937 by David Ezra Green and Derek Richter from the Biochemical Laboratory at Cambridge. The paper states, Adrenaline induces a vigorous oxygen uptake when added in low concentrations due to the formation of a red-coloured oxidation product, adrenochrome. In a broad sense, it's not so much adrenochrome but adrenaline which is special. Before the discovery and isolation of adrenaline, every other known psychedelic in the west was derived from plants. Ebergane which comes from the aboga shrub, Mescaline which comes from the peyote cactus, and LSD which comes from an ergot fungus on rye. Adrenaline marked an incredible milestone of a drug that could be extracted from and given to any other animal with adrenal glands. It was the same universal drug with similar effects across man and animal. So what exactly is adrenochrome? When adrenaline naturally decomposes in the body, it breaks down and produces adrenochrome. When adrenochrome decomposes further, it converts into androluten and the pigment melanin. In simple terms, the controversial nature of adrenochrome is because of the fact it comes from blood, and therefore serves as a connection between blood magic of the old world and the scientific and secular modern world. But since adrenochrome comes from adrenaline, why doesn't this same controversy apply to adrenaline as well? And what does Freemasonry or MK-Ultra have to do with any of this? Siting a paper from 1959 titled A Small Research in Schizophrenia by Doctors Osmond and Hoffer, they describe schizophrenia in very dire terms. Among the ills which afflict mankind today, few are more formidable, more universal, more persistent, more damaging, more mysterious and more elusive than Schizophrenia, the shattered mind. The paper also mentions that Krapeland believed there were glands somewhere in the body, producing poisons which affected the brain, later referred to by Carl Jung in 1909 as toxin X. Again from the research paper, in May 1950, our colleague Dr. John Smith is, while reading Roussier's book La Payotl, observed that some cases of acute schizophrenia closely resembled some mezcalin experiences, and even more interesting observation was then made. Listening to a recording of a mezcalin experience, a man mentioned that when he took large amounts of adrenaline, the outside world became changed. He had coloured visions with his eyes shut and feelings of unreality. Based on that, Doctors Osmond and Hoffer wondered if they might be onto a natural mezcalin-like compound M substance. So they began to consider the immediate derivatives of adrenaline, which included adrenochrome. During the Second World War, pinkish adrenaline which had lost its effects was used during anesthesia. Disturbances, which included hallucinations, occurred when the patient revived. When Osmond and Hoffer mentioned pinkish adrenaline to fellow researchers, they suggested adrenochrome, mentioning it might be related to every known hallucinogen, and provided some of this brilliant red stuff for them to experiment with. By October of 1952, Osmond and Hoffer had tested adrenochrome on themselves, their wives and their colleagues. They experienced subtle changes in thinking, perception and mood, not unlike those seen in early cases schizophrenia. Perhaps they had found their M substance, or toxin X. In July 1954, they also experimented with adrenal lutein, a greeny gold relative of adrenochrome, but found that it was too hard to work with because its effects could last for over a week. Through these studies by Osmond and Hoffer, they were able to consistently demonstrate that adrenochrome had hallucinogenic effects in the brain. They also discovered that when subjects were given LSD, there was a corresponding rise in the amount of adrenochrome detected in their blood. Running out of their supply and funding, the 1959 research into schizophrenia ends with, quote, "'So far, money to inquire into the workings of the brain, the organ of mind, have been generally meager. Money is readily available for every other organ, but the brain which has the vehicle of mind makes all else possible is grievously neglected.'" Answering that call for funding was the Northern Jurisdiction Supreme Council of 33rd Degree's Scottish Rite Freemasonry. In 1934, the Scottish Rite's Sovereign Grand Commander, Melvin M. Johnson, decided to focus on dementia pre-cocks research after meeting with the National Association for Mental Health. He assigned Dr. Nolan Don Carpentier-Lewis as the field director. This Scottish Rite Dementia Pre-Cocks initiative would go on to fund over 200 projects between 1934 and 1975 for around $30 million adjusted for inflation of the many studies funded by Dr. Lewis on behalf of the Scottish Rite. One of particular interest took place in 1953 in the Canadian Room of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York. Here is where Dr. Abram Hoffer and Dr. Humphrey Osmond presented their first report of their adrenochrome hypothesis. At the time, little was known about the biochemical process related to adrenochrome production within the body. However, it was clear that adrenochrome produced marked changes in subjects similar to LSD, Mescaline and Silocybin. The unstable nature of adrenochrome, however, led to inconsistent results which could make the adrenochrome hypothesis weak to unaware biochemists which failed to reproduce the results or detect adrenochrome in the blood and urine. The animals tested included spiders, fish, pigeons, rats, cats, dogs, monkeys and humans. The results of testing adrenochrome on various animals were so consistent that, quote, it can no longer be doubted that adrenochrome is indeed active. Not together by Scottish right funding, Dr. Lewis and Dr. Hoffer became colleagues and friends. Alongside a Dr. Ewan Cameron made somewhat infamous from his psychic driving research under the umbrella of then top secret CIA MK-Ultra program. Further evidence of the presence of adrenochrome in MK-Ultra research is from a declassified video in which a scientist explains an experimental substance called Mer 17 that can neutralize the effects of psychedelics. In furthermore, we are continuing our experimental work of now the genetic drugs of the muscly, the cannabis, the eunuchrome, etc. This video clip is evidence of the fact that the government did in fact consider adrenochrome a psychedelic substance on par with Mescaline and LSD. On the bright May morning of May 4th, 1953, British born writer Aldous Huxley was in his Hollywood home, about to have his first experience with a psychedelic drug, Mescaline. More precisely, he drank four tenths of a gram of Mescaline dissolved in half a glass of water. Given to him by his new friend, Dr. Humphrey Osment, associate to Dr. Abram Hoffer, Huxley's experience that day changed his perception forever and along with it American pop culture would soon follow. His first Mescaline trip inspired Huxley to write The Doors of Perception, published in 1954. In the fourth paragraph of The Doors of Perception, Huxley clearly mentions a drenochrome by name, likely hearing it from discussions with his friend Dr. Osment. Struck by the close similarity in chemical composition between Mescaline and adrenaline, further research revealed that Lysergic Acid LSD, an extremely potent hallucinogen derived from ergot, has a structural biochemical relationship to the others. Then came the discovery that a drenochrome, which is a product of the decomposition of adrenaline, can produce many of the symptoms observed in Mescaline intoxication. What makes a drenochrome unique is that instead of coming from the peyote cactus, Mescaline, or a fungus that grows on rye, it comes from the human body itself. Huxley himself points this out. But a drenochrome probably occurs spontaneously in the human body. In other words, each one of us may be capable of manufacturing a chemical. My newt doses of which are known to cause profound changes in consciousness. In 1962, the abbreviation of Drenchrome is mentioned in the book Clockwork Orange. Based on the Nadsat language from Anthony Burgess, it's mentioned alongside another Nadsat reference to synthetic Mescaline, Synth Mesc. This is notable because a drenochrome in Mescaline were grouped together by Aldous Huxley's The Doors of Perception. This hints that Burgess was familiar with Huxley's work. In fact, Burgess was more than just familiar with Huxley. He was an avid fan. In a review of Huxley's island from 1961 Burgess wrote, In the whole history of world literature no writer has been better equipped to create images of false and true utopias than Aldous Huxley. Another evidence that a direct connection can be made between The Doors of Perception and Clockwork Orange is explained on the website for the International Anthony Burgess Foundation. The inscription in the copy of Brave New World in the book collection at the International Anthony Burgess Foundation reveals that Burgess became familiar with Aldous Huxley's dystopia in 1938 while he was studying at the University of Manchester. This makes it Burgess's earliest recorded reading of a work of dystopian fiction. Huxley's work would go on to play a pivotal role in the creation of a Clockwork Orange in 1962. Perhaps even more popular than the book, Clockwork Orange was famously adapted by Stanley Kubrick into a feature-length film in 1971. The movie also includes a scene with the word Drenkrum on the wall, this being the first well-known public reference to Adrenochrome in movies or TV. At the time the Drenkrum reference was almost certainly only recognized by a small niche of people that were also familiar with The Doors of Perception. Aldous Huxley's brother Julian also became familiar with Doctor's Osmond and Hoffer, collaborating on a 1964 paper titled Schizophrenia as a genetic morphism. Another writer related to Hollywood's version of Adrenochrome was Terry Southern. Born 1924 in Alvarado, Texas, Terry went on to write for Kubrick's Doctor Strange Love, Saturday Night Live, and the film Easy Rider. Southern's short story The Blood of a Wig, 1967, was the last in a collection of writings called Red Dirt Marijuana and Other Tasts. The story has a vague nod to Adrenochrome as the blood of Schizophrenia patients. Listen man, you ever made Red Split? You know the blood of a wig? Well it's something else baby, I can tell you that. Red Split Man, it's called Red Split. It's Skitzo Juice. Blood. The Blood of a Wig. In the story, a man injects himself with the blood of Chin Lee, a well-known Chinese poet who is currently being treated in a mental institution. The effects of this Skitzo Juice, aka Adrenochrome, are described as sense derangement wise. It was unlike acid in that it was not a question of the essential eye having new insights, but of becoming a different person entirely. The character goes on to describe that not only did the injection allow him to feel what it was like to be insane, it also allowed him to feel Asian. This concept of injecting yourself with Red Split Adrenochrome, to somehow experience or otherwise absorb the traits of the donor, is another connection to ancient blood magic and rumoured powers of the pineal gland, which will over time be attributed to Adrenochrome as well. The 1971 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson injects some more speculation into the mythology of Adrenochrome. He writes, Adrenochrome you won't need much, just a little tiny taste. That stuff makes pure masculine seem like ginger beer. You'll go completely crazy if you take too much. Where'd you get this? I asked, you can't buy it. What kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff. The adrenaline glands from a living human body. It's no good if you get it out of a corpse. I know. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood, said it would make me higher than I've ever been in my life. This lineage of Hoffer and Osman in the world of science, the Huxley in academia, to Burgess Kubrick and Thompson in Hollywood, is the most direct reference to four specific persistent rumors about Adrenochrome. One, Adrenochrome is a powerful psychedelics. Two, Adrenochrome is better fresh. Three, Adrenochrome is better when derived from younger animals. And four, Adrenochrome is associated somehow with the pineal gland. Coincidentally, Adrenochrome is the very first item listed in Adam Gottlieb's book, Legal Highs, due to the book listing each drug in alphabetical order. The entire entry is quite short and reads, effects, physical stimulating, feeling of well-being, slight reduction of thought processes. Adrenochrome causes chemically induced schizophrenia. William Gibson is an American-Canadian writer most well-known for his transhumanist book Neuromancer, which has been credited as being a catalyst for the entire subgenre of science fiction now known as Cyberpunk. Gibson is also credited with coining the word cyberspace, first using it in a series of short stories compiled as Burning Chrome in 1982. In that collection is a story titled The Winter Market, which has a reference to Adrenochrome. That's the trouble with designer drugs, they're too clever. That stuff you're doing has some tricky tale on one of its molecules, keeps you from turning the decomposed adrenaline into Adrenochrome. If it didn't, you'd be schizophrenic by now. In 1982, the Sisters of Mercy make an early mention to Adrenochrome in their song named after the chemical, with lyrics such as high tide, wide-eyed, sped on Adrenochrome, filled with panic in their eyes rise, dead on Adrenochrome. In 1986, Stephen King's It talks of glands that can be tapped, chemicals of fear, and that the fears of children were simpler and more powerful. Damien Hearst, an artist known for his provocative works, sold a painting on May 22, 1992 at Christie's in London, titled Adrenochrome's Semicarb as Own Sulfonet. Here sixty years after the discovery of Adrenochrome, it had entered the world of fine art. 1998 saw a movie adaptation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas starring Johnny Depp, Benicio Del Toro, and directed by Terry Gillum. This was perhaps the widest exposure the public had to Adrenochrome since Kubrick's adaptation of Clockwork Orange over three decades before. By 2016, Adrenochrome became dispersed through international culture, being cited on daytime talk shows, a 2017 movie titled Adrenochrome, and a 2020 Bulgarian news report that referred to Adrenochrome as a satanic narcotic. In 2021, Bill Maher mentioned Adrenochrome on his HBO show Real Time, itself a reference to Jim Caviezel discussing it at a political rally. The following year saw mentions of Adrenochrome by name in the television shows The Pentaverate, The Watcher, and The Boys. So here we have a full history and breakdown of Adrenochrome. These understood, highly controversial, and criminally understudied chemical produced naturally in the human body and now at the center of countless works of fiction. The ties between Adrenochrome and Scottish Rite Freemasonry began in the 1930s, supplemented in the 1950s through the CIA's MK Ultra, and from there injected into the mainstream of pop culture. Hoffa wrote a retrospective of his thoughts on Adrenochrome in a 1994 paper called Schizophrenia, an evolutionary defense against severe stress. In it, Dr. Hoffa, pioneer of Adrenochrome research, still maintains Adrenochrome and Adrenaluten in the blood and brain, cause a toxic psychosis called Schizophrenia. Toxin exis, as Jung had called it over a century ago. In a surprising twist, Dr. Hoffa also suggests that high levels of Adrenochrome could in fact be related to the fountain of youth after all. The paper states, there is no overall advantage in having Schizophrenia in being sick. The advantage arises from having some of the genes of schizophrenia which do not express themselves, that is in the first order relatives of the patients. Parents, children and siblings of Schizophrenics will have advantages in both physical and intellectual areas. Physical. More youthful in appearance, especially as they age with much less gray hair. Fewer attacks of autoimmune diseases, more ability to tolerate pain, more resistance against bacterial infections. There is evidence they get cancer less frequently, intellectual, more creative in their thinking, and many have become top scientists, artists, writers and poets. Another surprising claim that LSD might owe its psychomemetic properties to a disturbance of Adrenal and metabolism, and that psychedelic experience is a result of the activity from both LSD and Adrenochrome. When the body can't make enough Adrenochrome, the LSD by itself causes anxiety and tension. Injecting Adrenochrome allows the full experience to develop.
