Description:
好的，这是一份基于您提供的英文文本总结的“黑盒方法”学习策略的中文概述，包括大纲、核心结论、框架和美人鱼概念图。

**黑盒方法：快速学习编程概念的有效途径**

**一、 引言**
*   介绍黑盒方法作为一种快速学习和应用编程概念的有效途径。
*   适用于算法、数据结构和通用代码。
*   在竞技编程和通用编程中都有效。

**二、 什么是黑盒方法？**
*   定义：将一段代码或技术视为一个“黑盒”。
*   理解：专注于其功能（输入、输出、目的）以及性能（如复杂度、内存占用）。
*   忽略：不深入理解其内部实现机制或“魔术”。
*   类比：使用API、库函数（如排序），只需调用，不关心其内部工作原理。

**三、 为什么使用黑盒方法？（优点与益处）**
*   **速度快：** 掌握使用所需的信息远少于完全理解所需信息（可能只需几分钟 vs 几小时/几天）。
*   **快速应用：** 能够在不完全理解的情况下，迅速在实际问题（如编程竞赛）中使用复杂技术。
*   **降低门槛：** 使学习曲线更平缓，更容易跨越“未知”到“可用”的鸿沟。
*   **识别问题：** 帮助在遇到问题时，快速识别出可能相关的概念或技术。
*   **聚焦学习：** 当决定深入学习时，已知其“做什么”，学习过程更聚焦于“如何做”，减少学习畏惧感。
*   **实践机会：** 早期应用帮助找到更多练习机会。
*   **提高表现：** 通过在竞赛等场景中应用，能立即提升解决问题的能力和表现。

**四、 示例**
*   常见的库函数：数组排序。
*   竞技编程中的例子：
    *   Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree): 描述了其功能（更新、求前缀和）和复杂度，但忽略了位操作细节。
    *   Suffix Array (后缀数组): 成功应用于高难度问题，作者仅了解其功能。
    *   Convex Hull Trick (凸包技巧): 作者长期使用，甚至能做直播讲解，但初期并不理解其工作原理。
*   个人经历：通过黑盒应用在Codeforces/CodeChef等平台获得高排名和保留高评分。

**五、 如何获取黑盒代码与资源？**
*   利用现有、经过充分测试的代码库和在线资源。
*   推荐资源：
    *   AppCoder Library (ACL)：提供功能、复杂度和实用性描述，黑盒式文档风格。
    *   CP Algorithms：提供代码和解释，但可直接使用代码。
    *   其他库：Cacto, BenQ's library。
*   特点：这些资源提供了使用技术所需的一切信息，而无需查看或理解内部实现。

**六、 与完全学习的关系**
*   黑盒方法是学习过程中的一个优秀**起步**或**中间步骤**。
*   它不是完全理解的替代品。
*   完全理解在需要修改或定制代码时变得必要。
*   通过黑盒获得的早期应用经验能巩固后续的深入学习。

**七、 结论**
*   黑盒方法耗时少，收益大。
*   能让你更快地将学习到的概念投入实践。
*   是加速编程学习进程的有效工具。

**核心结论：**
黑盒方法能让你在不完全理解概念内部机制的情况下快速掌握其用法，从而有效加速学习和实践进程。

**Overarching Framework (总体框架):**
一种基于“知其然不知其所以然”的快速学习策略，强调先掌握工具的使用（黑盒），再深入理解其内部原理。

essentially an effective method to learn essentially an effective method to learn many different concepts many different concepts many different concepts quickly this method is dubbed black quickly this method is dubbed black quickly this method is dubbed black boxing and as you can see here i've boxing and as you can see here i've boxing and as you can see here i've hand-drawn a cube to represent this if hand-drawn a cube to represent this if hand-drawn a cube to represent this if you like this you like this you like this so this allows you to apply many so this allows you to apply many so this allows you to apply many different techniques like algorithms different techniques like algorithms different techniques like algorithms data structures or just pieces of code data structures or just pieces of code data structures or just pieces of code in general in general in general and it works for competitive programming and it works for competitive programming and it works for competitive programming or even just or even just or even just general programming because there's a general programming because there's a general programming because there's a lot of similarity between the two and lot of similarity between the two and lot of similarity between the two and the way the method is used the way the method is used the way the method is used so in particular i've used this a lot so in particular i've used this a lot so in particular i've used this a lot during some contests of mine during some contests of mine during some contests of mine to get uh where i am now with a to get uh where i am now with a to get uh where i am now with a significant example being how i use that significant example being how i use that significant example being how i use that to solve a to solve a to solve a quite hard problem with a technique i quite hard problem with a technique i quite hard problem with a technique i didn't even know much about didn't even know much about didn't even know much about only a brief overview of what it did and only a brief overview of what it did and only a brief overview of what it did and that ended up getting me tenth and that ended up getting me tenth and that ended up getting me tenth and saving my seven star rating on code chef saving my seven star rating on code chef saving my seven star rating on code chef so yeah this method works so yeah this method works so yeah this method works and in fact this is something we and in fact this is something we and in fact this is something we generally use generally use generally use all the time in general programming all the time in general programming all the time in general programming without even thinking much about it without even thinking much about it without even thinking much about it so what even is a black box well we can so what even is a black box well we can so what even is a black box well we can pull up wikipedia's definition as pull up wikipedia's definition as pull up wikipedia's definition as support but essentially it just means support but essentially it just means support but essentially it just means that it's some piece of code that does that it's some piece of code that does that it's some piece of code that does something something something and we understand what it does but not and we understand what it does but not and we understand what it does but not really how it does it it's sort of really how it does it it's sort of really how it does it it's sort of like they say it's viewed in terms of like they say it's viewed in terms of like they say it's viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs but not its inputs and outputs but not its inputs and outputs but not the internal mechanisms that are the internal mechanisms that are the internal mechanisms that are converting that input into the output converting that input into the output converting that input into the output and the reason we don't understand what and the reason we don't understand what and the reason we don't understand what it does the reason we don't understand it does the reason we don't understand it does the reason we don't understand how it does it is because how it does it is because how it does it is because we don't need to like many apis or we don't need to like many apis or we don't need to like many apis or internal libraries internal libraries internal libraries like we already use for many portions of like we already use for many portions of like we already use for many portions of our code like input and output for our code like input and output for our code like input and output for example example example we let the pre-written code do the we let the pre-written code do the we let the pre-written code do the hidden magic and only worry about what hidden magic and only worry about what hidden magic and only worry about what we do with the results we do with the results we do with the results and the cool thing about programs is and the cool thing about programs is and the cool thing about programs is that you can literally just copy and that you can literally just copy and that you can literally just copy and paste some piece of code in paste some piece of code in paste some piece of code in and regardless of how much you and regardless of how much you and regardless of how much you understand it it's still going to work understand it it's still going to work understand it it's still going to work so let's take a very common example of so let's take a very common example of so let's take a very common example of sorting an array for many languages we sorting an array for many languages we sorting an array for many languages we use an internal algorithm to sort an use an internal algorithm to sort an use an internal algorithm to sort an array some part of the array some part of the array some part of the programming languages library and programming languages library and programming languages library and just as a brief refresher if it's just as a brief refresher if it's just as a brief refresher if it's unfamiliar to you sorting is just unfamiliar to you sorting is just unfamiliar to you sorting is just reordering elements in some kind of reordering elements in some kind of reordering elements in some kind of increasing increasing increasing order and i'm also so proud of this cube order and i'm also so proud of this cube order and i'm also so proud of this cube drawing that i'm going to keep it here drawing that i'm going to keep it here drawing that i'm going to keep it here for this example for this example for this example so often in general we do learn so often in general we do learn so often in general we do learn how this algorithm works sorting or at how this algorithm works sorting or at how this algorithm works sorting or at least some viable sorting algorithm least some viable sorting algorithm least some viable sorting algorithm just because it's like one of the common just because it's like one of the common just because it's like one of the common introductory things to programming introductory things to programming introductory things to programming and it's often a good exercise but it's and it's often a good exercise but it's and it's often a good exercise but it's not not not necessary to use the library like a necessary to use the library like a necessary to use the library like a single function call does all the work single function call does all the work single function call does all the work for us for us for us i mean all we do is we call some sorting i mean all we do is we call some sorting i mean all we do is we call some sorting method or function and that's it method or function and that's it method or function and that's it we don't worry about what's going on we don't worry about what's going on we don't worry about what's going on inside and other library uses work the inside and other library uses work the inside and other library uses work the same way we simply use their functions same way we simply use their functions same way we simply use their functions without implementing them ourselves a different example is feminic trees are a different example is feminic trees are a different example is feminic trees are binary index trees which is a topic and binary index trees which is a topic and binary index trees which is a topic and topic from competitive programming so if topic from competitive programming so if topic from competitive programming so if you already know these great then it's a you already know these great then it's a you already know these great then it's a good example and if you don't good example and if you don't good example and if you don't then that's fine and the whole point of then that's fine and the whole point of then that's fine and the whole point of this is that it will only take me like this is that it will only take me like this is that it will only take me like a few seconds up to a minute to explain a few seconds up to a minute to explain a few seconds up to a minute to explain it so the quick black box description of it so the quick black box description of it so the quick black box description of what it is what it is what it is is it basically operates on an array it is it basically operates on an array it is it basically operates on an array it supports two different operations supports two different operations supports two different operations the first is that you can pick some the first is that you can pick some the first is that you can pick some index some position in the array index some position in the array index some position in the array and add some value x to it and the and add some value x to it and the and add some value x to it and the second is that you can query the second is that you can query the second is that you can query the sum of the first x elements or the first sum of the first x elements or the first sum of the first x elements or the first i elements both of these operations i elements both of these operations i elements both of these operations take over log n complexity and um it's o of n to initialize and oven um it's o of n to initialize and oven um it's o of n to initialize and oven memory overall memory overall memory overall and that's it there is some complicated and that's it there is some complicated and that's it there is some complicated underlying bitwise logic that makes it underlying bitwise logic that makes it underlying bitwise logic that makes it work work work but to use it none of that is actually but to use it none of that is actually but to use it none of that is actually necessary to know necessary to know necessary to know and in fact i honestly don't even and in fact i honestly don't even and in fact i honestly don't even understand it myself because i've never understand it myself because i've never understand it myself because i've never bothered to because it's never been bothered to because it's never been bothered to because it's never been necessary necessary necessary and nonetheless i've solved many many and nonetheless i've solved many many and nonetheless i've solved many many problems using this technique problems using this technique problems using this technique so my template which is the code you can so my template which is the code you can so my template which is the code you can see below see below see below or in front of you is sort of structured or in front of you is sort of structured or in front of you is sort of structured like an api like an api like an api where these add and query functions are where these add and query functions are where these add and query functions are just simply just simply just simply using the struct and telling it to do using the struct and telling it to do using the struct and telling it to do that so now let's pull out the trusty paint so now let's pull out the trusty paint so now let's pull out the trusty paint for a demonstration for a demonstration for a demonstration and if you're new to this channel well i and if you're new to this channel well i and if you're new to this channel well i basically use it for everything basically use it for everything basically use it for everything so that will be how it goes in this so that will be how it goes in this so that will be how it goes in this diagram diagram diagram vertical distance represents time and vertical distance represents time and vertical distance represents time and basically the standard strategy for basically the standard strategy for basically the standard strategy for learning is to pick some list of topics learning is to pick some list of topics learning is to pick some list of topics and then and then and then learn them one by one however this is learn them one by one however this is learn them one by one however this is rather slow and during the period of rather slow and during the period of rather slow and during the period of learning learning learning for the topics that you haven't even for the topics that you haven't even for the topics that you haven't even looked at yet you won't know anything or looked at yet you won't know anything or looked at yet you won't know anything or much about any of them much about any of them much about any of them so say some contest comes and you'd want so say some contest comes and you'd want so say some contest comes and you'd want to do it because the contest to do it because the contest to do it because the contest and contests are always good for you to and contests are always good for you to and contests are always good for you to learn from which i made a video on learn from which i made a video on learn from which i made a video on um essentially um essentially um essentially you're not going to be able to do you're not going to be able to do you're not going to be able to do anything maybe you anything maybe you anything maybe you know enough about topic a which you've know enough about topic a which you've know enough about topic a which you've learned some about to be able to do it learned some about to be able to do it learned some about to be able to do it but but but for topics for concepts b and c you're for topics for concepts b and c you're for topics for concepts b and c you're just totally screwed there's nothing you just totally screwed there's nothing you just totally screwed there's nothing you can do you don't really know about them can do you don't really know about them can do you don't really know about them so if those show up there's nothing so if those show up there's nothing so if those show up there's nothing you'll be able to do so it's sort of bad in the intermediate so it's sort of bad in the intermediate so it's sort of bad in the intermediate step but step but step but now let's introduce black boxing which now let's introduce black boxing which now let's introduce black boxing which is much closer to is much closer to is much closer to the unknown side of things because it the unknown side of things because it the unknown side of things because it doesn't take that much time to learn it doesn't take that much time to learn it doesn't take that much time to learn it it's an easy gap to cross versus it's an easy gap to cross versus it's an easy gap to cross versus learning an entire thing learning an entire thing learning an entire thing now say i black box all three of the now say i black box all three of the now say i black box all three of the concepts before starting to fully learn concepts before starting to fully learn concepts before starting to fully learn them not necessarily as a substitute for them not necessarily as a substitute for them not necessarily as a substitute for learning them learning them learning them just as a start and i think this should just as a start and i think this should just as a start and i think this should be the way that black boxing is used be the way that black boxing is used be the way that black boxing is used it's still a good idea to eventually it's still a good idea to eventually it's still a good idea to eventually learn things because learn things because learn things because it's sort of going to be necessary if it's sort of going to be necessary if it's sort of going to be necessary if you ever want to make modifications to you ever want to make modifications to you ever want to make modifications to something which does show up something which does show up something which does show up somewhat frequently but it's a good somewhat frequently but it's a good somewhat frequently but it's a good first step and it will let you be first step and it will let you be first step and it will let you be informed about all the algorithms and informed about all the algorithms and informed about all the algorithms and data structures and everything data structures and everything data structures and everything that you're interested in using so this black boxing may also involve so this black boxing may also involve so this black boxing may also involve solving a few problems or just playing solving a few problems or just playing solving a few problems or just playing with a bit with a bit with a bit playing with it a bit getting a bit of playing with it a bit getting a bit of playing with it a bit getting a bit of practice just get comfortable practice just get comfortable practice just get comfortable and the plan is to eventually learn them and the plan is to eventually learn them and the plan is to eventually learn them of course but just starting with these of course but just starting with these of course but just starting with these techniques as black boxes is a good techniques as black boxes is a good techniques as black boxes is a good enough introduction to them enough introduction to them enough introduction to them now in this scenario say the contest now in this scenario say the contest now in this scenario say the contest happens and i've already blockboxed happens and i've already blockboxed happens and i've already blockboxed these three and i'm in the process of these three and i'm in the process of these three and i'm in the process of learning learning learning concept a but i'm already at the point concept a but i'm already at the point concept a but i'm already at the point where i'm able to where i'm able to where i'm able to use all three concepts use all three concepts use all three concepts effectively so i know enough about all effectively so i know enough about all effectively so i know enough about all three of the topics to solve three of the topics to solve three of the topics to solve the problems that use them so i do the problems that use them so i do the problems that use them so i do and i do much better on this contest and i do much better on this contest and i do much better on this contest potentially if it has these topics potentially if it has these topics potentially if it has these topics then if i hadn't used the black boxing then if i hadn't used the black boxing then if i hadn't used the black boxing and i got some practice out of it and i got some practice out of it and i got some practice out of it because now i know these problems are because now i know these problems are because now i know these problems are going to use these concepts going to use these concepts going to use these concepts so blackboxing is basically like an so blackboxing is basically like an so blackboxing is basically like an intermediate step except it has no intermediate step except it has no intermediate step except it has no drawbacks drawbacks drawbacks you're going to learn this stuff anyway you're going to learn this stuff anyway you're going to learn this stuff anyway so it can really only benefit you so it can really only benefit you so it can really only benefit you and the benefits are still really good so let's talk advantages why is this so let's talk advantages why is this so let's talk advantages why is this useful it definitely works very quickly useful it definitely works very quickly useful it definitely works very quickly in that the information required to use in that the information required to use in that the information required to use something is much less than the something is much less than the something is much less than the information required to fully understand information required to fully understand information required to fully understand something as you could have seen from my something as you could have seen from my something as you could have seen from my previous examples it took like previous examples it took like previous examples it took like maybe around a minute or two just to maybe around a minute or two just to maybe around a minute or two just to explain explain explain the black box rendition of some concept especially for rather hard topics ones especially for rather hard topics ones especially for rather hard topics ones that can take like hours or even that can take like hours or even that can take like hours or even multiple days to learn and grasp multiple days to learn and grasp multiple days to learn and grasp this saves a lot of the work at least this saves a lot of the work at least this saves a lot of the work at least initially initially initially it allows you to have most of the it allows you to have most of the it allows you to have most of the necessary information very quickly necessary information very quickly necessary information very quickly and then when you decide to learn it and then when you decide to learn it and then when you decide to learn it later you'll be able to solidify that later you'll be able to solidify that later you'll be able to solidify that knowledge later on knowledge later on knowledge later on as you formally learn things so if you as you formally learn things so if you as you formally learn things so if you encounter a problem related to something encounter a problem related to something encounter a problem related to something you're not so well versed in you're not so well versed in you're not so well versed in perhaps you have it black boxed in your perhaps you have it black boxed in your perhaps you have it black boxed in your head but you don't exactly head but you don't exactly head but you don't exactly exactly understand it yet at the very exactly understand it yet at the very exactly understand it yet at the very least you do know what to look for you least you do know what to look for you least you do know what to look for you know that this was the concept involved know that this was the concept involved know that this was the concept involved you're just not that good at that you're just not that good at that you're just not that good at that concept yet concept yet concept yet so it lets you sort of figure out so it lets you sort of figure out so it lets you sort of figure out where you should go from a certain point where you should go from a certain point where you should go from a certain point it also allows you to identify related it also allows you to identify related it also allows you to identify related problems as you come across them problems as you come across them problems as you come across them so yeah when you do eventually learn so yeah when you do eventually learn so yeah when you do eventually learn something you already know something you already know something you already know places where you can practice and apply places where you can practice and apply places where you can practice and apply it you've already found some practice it you've already found some practice it you've already found some practice problems for yourself problems for yourself problems for yourself by just having the black box and by just having the black box and by just having the black box and recognizing that a certain problem recognizing that a certain problem recognizing that a certain problem requires a certain concept requires a certain concept requires a certain concept it will ultimately keep your learning it will ultimately keep your learning it will ultimately keep your learning focused because you already know what focused because you already know what focused because you already know what everything is everything is everything is doing you know what the purpose of it is doing you know what the purpose of it is doing you know what the purpose of it is all you're doing all you're doing all you're doing once you transition from having once you transition from having once you transition from having something black boxed something black boxed something black boxed to learning it normally you're just to learning it normally you're just to learning it normally you're just figuring out how it works figuring out how it works figuring out how it works you already know what it does you you already know what it does you you already know what it does you already know everything that's required already know everything that's required already know everything that's required to use it you're just understanding the to use it you're just understanding the to use it you're just understanding the internal mechanisms of it and also on internal mechanisms of it and also on internal mechanisms of it and also on that note when you understand the that note when you understand the that note when you understand the underlying purpose of something and you underlying purpose of something and you underlying purpose of something and you really like acquainted with it really like acquainted with it really like acquainted with it it makes it a lot less scary to learn it it makes it a lot less scary to learn it it makes it a lot less scary to learn it for real because you know the end result for real because you know the end result for real because you know the end result already it's just figuring out how it already it's just figuring out how it already it's just figuring out how it gets there now this wouldn't be one of my videos if now this wouldn't be one of my videos if now this wouldn't be one of my videos if i didn't take every opportunity to i didn't take every opportunity to i didn't take every opportunity to flex so here's some examples from my own flex so here's some examples from my own flex so here's some examples from my own experience where this this black boxing experience where this this black boxing experience where this this black boxing has actually worked for me has actually worked for me has actually worked for me as i mentioned in the beginning there as i mentioned in the beginning there as i mentioned in the beginning there was one where i used was one where i used was one where i used i used a complicated concept that i i used a complicated concept that i i used a complicated concept that i didn't really know much about to didn't really know much about to didn't really know much about to get 10th place in a contest and again get 10th place in a contest and again get 10th place in a contest and again retain my seven star rating retain my seven star rating retain my seven star rating and this was an example of using a and this was an example of using a and this was an example of using a suffix array which is a complicated suffix array which is a complicated suffix array which is a complicated yeah like i said a complicated concept yeah like i said a complicated concept yeah like i said a complicated concept it's not really related to this video so it's not really related to this video so it's not really related to this video so you don't have to you don't have to you don't have to know it to understand this but the point know it to understand this but the point know it to understand this but the point is that i is that i is that i essentially had this black box i essentially had this black box i essentially had this black box i understood what this algorithm did understood what this algorithm did understood what this algorithm did and what it produced but had no idea how and what it produced but had no idea how and what it produced but had no idea how it worked and just because it worked and just because it worked and just because of that i was able to copy paste it and of that i was able to copy paste it and of that i was able to copy paste it and make it work make it work make it work and yeah as as like clearly it worked and yeah as as like clearly it worked and yeah as as like clearly it worked out out out uh two other examples one of them was uh two other examples one of them was uh two other examples one of them was where i actually learned something in where i actually learned something in where i actually learned something in contest contest contest using a very cool library called the app using a very cool library called the app using a very cool library called the app coder library coder library coder library and this library is nice because it's and this library is nice because it's and this library is nice because it's sort of sort of sort of it like it describes things in a black it like it describes things in a black it like it describes things in a black box way box way box way where it tells you the un where it tells where it tells you the un where it tells where it tells you the un where it tells you the you the you the functions and what it does and their functions and what it does and their functions and what it does and their complexities and everything you'd ever complexities and everything you'd ever complexities and everything you'd ever need to know to use it need to know to use it need to know to use it but it doesn't need to give details on but it doesn't need to give details on but it doesn't need to give details on the code so it's the code so it's the code so it's very useful for someone who's taking the very useful for someone who's taking the very useful for someone who's taking the black boxing approach because black boxing approach because black boxing approach because it gives you exactly what you need for it gives you exactly what you need for it gives you exactly what you need for everything so i actually learned this everything so i actually learned this everything so i actually learned this thing in contest and then was able to thing in contest and then was able to thing in contest and then was able to solve the problem using it solve the problem using it solve the problem using it and yeah that that worked out too and yeah that that worked out too and yeah that that worked out too and then a separate example is the and then a separate example is the and then a separate example is the a even harder algorithm called the a even harder algorithm called the a even harder algorithm called the convex hall trick convex hall trick convex hall trick which is essentially something i've been which is essentially something i've been which is essentially something i've been using for a long time using for a long time using for a long time i made a stream on it without even i made a stream on it without even i made a stream on it without even understanding how it works just because understanding how it works just because understanding how it works just because black boxing was so effective black boxing was so effective black boxing was so effective and i also did i also saved my and i also did i also saved my and i also did i also saved my rating in another hard code chef contest rating in another hard code chef contest rating in another hard code chef contest by copy pasting convex hold trick by copy pasting convex hold trick by copy pasting convex hold trick in that and that got me i believe 13th so showing this code if you'll notice so showing this code if you'll notice so showing this code if you'll notice the only thing that the only thing that the only thing that the only things that really matter are the only things that really matter are the only things that really matter are the two functions the two functions the two functions insert line which will insert a line insert line which will insert a line insert line which will insert a line even if you don't understand what that even if you don't understand what that even if you don't understand what that means it's just simply there are two means it's just simply there are two means it's just simply there are two functions that control everything functions that control everything functions that control everything and everything else is internal the and everything else is internal the and everything else is internal the insert line and eval functions insert line and eval functions insert line and eval functions are the api and everything else is are the api and everything else is are the api and everything else is magic for all i know magic for all i know magic for all i know so a bit of advice on the practicality so a bit of advice on the practicality so a bit of advice on the practicality of using the black box method of using the black box method of using the black box method i mean how would you even find working i mean how would you even find working i mean how would you even find working code without having to understand and code without having to understand and code without having to understand and produce it yourself produce it yourself produce it yourself right well as it turns out there are right well as it turns out there are right well as it turns out there are plenty of well-tested and useful plenty of well-tested and useful plenty of well-tested and useful libraries that contain code for a lot of libraries that contain code for a lot of libraries that contain code for a lot of different things different things different things i'll include all these in the i'll include all these in the i'll include all these in the description but description but description but um a brief overview of what some of them um a brief overview of what some of them um a brief overview of what some of them do the app coder library or acl do the app coder library or acl do the app coder library or acl is a working and a very broad library is a working and a very broad library is a working and a very broad library with with with sort of black box style documentation sort of black box style documentation sort of black box style documentation they give the complexity they give the complexity they give the complexity and the utility the functions what the and the utility the functions what the and the utility the functions what the what the code does but not necessarily what the code does but not necessarily what the code does but not necessarily how the code works because it's not how the code works because it's not how the code works because it's not necessary necessary necessary so it basically aligns exactly with how so it basically aligns exactly with how so it basically aligns exactly with how black boxing works black boxing works black boxing works there's a site called cp algorithms there's a site called cp algorithms there's a site called cp algorithms which gives and by the way cp is for which gives and by the way cp is for which gives and by the way cp is for competitive programming not the other competitive programming not the other competitive programming not the other meaning of the acronym but meaning of the acronym but meaning of the acronym but it gives both code and explanations up it gives both code and explanations up it gives both code and explanations up for it for it for it and um but the important thing is that and um but the important thing is that and um but the important thing is that is that it gives full code without any is that it gives full code without any is that it gives full code without any sort of like sort of like sort of like necessary interpretation most of the necessary interpretation most of the necessary interpretation most of the time some pages aren't perfect but most time some pages aren't perfect but most time some pages aren't perfect but most of the time it will give full code of the time it will give full code of the time it will give full code there are also some other basic there are also some other basic there are also some other basic libraries like cacto i believe that's libraries like cacto i believe that's libraries like cacto i believe that's how you pronounce that how you pronounce that how you pronounce that and also a library by ben q one of the and also a library by ben q one of the and also a library by ben q one of the top competitive programmers currently top competitive programmers currently top competitive programmers currently second on cohorts he's pretty good second on cohorts he's pretty good second on cohorts he's pretty good and if you want i also have my own and if you want i also have my own and if you want i also have my own library with some stuff but it's library with some stuff but it's library with some stuff but it's uh not how do i put this it's not too uh not how do i put this it's not too uh not how do i put this it's not too friendly for anyone who isn't me friendly for anyone who isn't me friendly for anyone who isn't me so possibly i'll clean it up in the so possibly i'll clean it up in the so possibly i'll clean it up in the future but i would recommend using some future but i would recommend using some future but i would recommend using some of the other ones instead of mine of the other ones instead of mine of the other ones instead of mine and i'm sure there are also probably and i'm sure there are also probably and i'm sure there are also probably plenty of others that you could find on plenty of others that you could find on plenty of others that you could find on the internet the internet the internet all right so that's block boxing and all right so that's block boxing and all right so that's block boxing and whether you choose to use it or not is whether you choose to use it or not is whether you choose to use it or not is totally up to you totally up to you totally up to you but i would say it can't hurt for sure but i would say it can't hurt for sure but i would say it can't hurt for sure it takes a really short time like mere it takes a really short time like mere it takes a really short time like mere minutes for minutes for minutes for a single topic and it involves a

to have anyway need to have anyway when you're learning something because when you're learning something because when you're learning something because it's the utility it's what the it's the utility it's what the it's the utility it's what the thing actually does and it also gives thing actually does and it also gives thing actually does and it also gives you a brief but sufficient you a brief
