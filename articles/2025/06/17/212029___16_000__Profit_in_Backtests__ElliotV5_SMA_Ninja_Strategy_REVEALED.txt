Description:
以下是对文本内容的提炼和总结：

**核心要点提炼与总结**

**1. 概述**
    *   介绍：艾略特 V5 SMA 忍者策略（Elliot V5 SMA Ninja Strategy），一个剥头皮算法交易策略，适用于 Fract Trade 平台。
    *   目标：分析策略，评估回测结果（超过 16,000% 的假定利润），并讨论其现实可行性。

**2. 策略细节**
    *   性质：剥头皮策略，使用 5 分钟时间周期进行入场，1 小时时间周期检测趋势。
    *   核心指标：指数移动平均线（EMA）、艾略特波浪震荡指标（EWO）、相对强弱指数（RSI）和成交量。其他指标在代码中可能仅为占位符。
    *   入场规则：
        *   规则 1 (看涨回调)：价格低于 EMA * 低偏移，EWO 高于高阈值，RSI 低于买入阈值，且有正成交量。
        *   规则 2：价格低于 EMA * 低偏移，EWO 低于低阈值，且有正成交量。满足任一条件即可入场。
    *   出场规则：价格高于卖出 EMA * 高偏移，且有正成交量。
    *   风险管理：使用 ROI 表、跟踪止损和硬止损（-18.9%）。

**3. 回测结果**
    *   条件：在相同交易对、时间周期和条件下进行，无前瞻偏差。
    *   主要数据：
        *   假定利润：超过 16,000%。
        *   胜率：81%。
        *   交易次数：超过 4,600。
        *   最大回撤：略低于 9%。
        *   盈利交易对比例：89%。
        *   其他指标（Comer, Shortino, Sharp）非常乐观。

**4. 分析与注意事项**
    *   结果是基于回测，最适合强劲的看涨市场。
    *   低回撤表现取决于算法的启动时机（建议在下跌时启动，但这很难）。
    *   应对回测结果保持高度怀疑态度，尤其是来自 YouTube 视频的数据。
    *   权益曲线图显示策略能很好地捕捉上涨脉冲。
    *   盈利交易数量多于亏损交易。
    *   无法区分哪个入场规则表现最佳（因代码未标记）。
    *   跟踪止损和主出场信号贡献了最高的利润。
    *   平均回撤 0.6%，但存在较高回撤的尖峰。
    *   策略在“策略排行榜”中综合排名靠前（前三），不仅考虑利润，也考虑风险管理等因素。
    *   算法交易存在固有的注意事项和风险。

**5. 结论与资源**
    *   策略在回测中显示出巨大的盈利潜力，但需注意算法交易的风险和启动时机等实际应用问题。
    *   获取资源：完整的代码、回测报告和结果可在 Patreon 页面获取（包含 Discord）。
    *   推荐：作者撰写的《算法加密货币交易入门》书籍适合初学者。
    *   行动呼吁：点赞、订阅频道以获取更多策略分析。

**核心结论（一句话）**

回测显示该策略具有巨大潜力，但现实应用中需保持高度怀疑并考虑启动时机和风险管理。

Over 16, 000% in profit in back tests. Is this realistic? Well, after you have watched this video, you will know the answer because today I'm going to break down the Elliot V5 SMA Ninja Strategy, a scalping powerhouse that you can run on Fract Trade. So, stick around because the results might just change how you trade forever. [Music] Let's dive into the Elliot V5 SMA Ninja Strategy. Now, the origin of this code is a bit of a mystery uh because no author is credited. If you know the creator, then drop it in the comments because credits where credits are due. In this algorithm, it's all about catching quick moves in the market using a simple blend of classic indicators. Now, don't let yourself get fooled by all these indicators that are written down in this code here because they all seem to be placeholders and not actually used in the strategy. What is important, however, is that this strategy seems to be a scalping one for 5 minute time frame entries and 1 hour time frame for trend detection. The real signals come from the exponential moving average, deli at wave oscillator, RSI, and volume. And here's how it works. There are actually two entry rules. The first condition is a bullish pullback where price comes below the EMA and the low offset. The EWO should be above a high threshold and the RSI below a buy threshold and there should be positive volume. And there is also a second condition where the price should be below the EMA times a low offset. The EWO should be below a low threshold and there is also a positive volume. And if one of those conditions is met, then the strategy enters a trade. Very simple. The exit rule is equally simple because the price should be above a sell EMA times a high offset and there should be a positive volume. And with most of these fract trade strategies, there is also an ROI table that provides the exit signals, a trailing stop-loss, which is used in this case, and the hard stop-loss of minus 18. 9. Now, if you follow my channel, then you know that I always back test these strategies in the same conditions with the same pairs and over the same time period. The only difference between all these back tests is the strategy code itself and in this case the rules although simple still provided these very wonderful results. I have used the look ahead bias functionality of the fract trade bot and no bias was detected. You can always download the code and these back test results that I have from my patreon site. The hypothetical profit was over 16, 000% with a win rate of 81%. The number of trades was also over 4, 600 and the draw down was slightly less than 9%. Commer, shortino, sharp are all very optimistic and also very important. 89% of the pairs that I use for tests were profitable. Again, these results are from the back tests and they look best in strong bullish markets. The draw down is low, but only if you start at the right time. And always look at these results with a high amount of skepticism. You should do that with every YouTube video that shows trading results. By the way, the equity plot shows that this strategy catches impulses to the upside very well. Overall, there are more winning trades than losing ones, but I already mentioned that. Unfortunately, the trade entries in this code were not accompanied by labels. So, I cannot say which entry rules performed the best here. But the exit signals that cause the highest profits are the trading stop-loss and the exit signal itself. And this is even more visible in this entry and exit signal relationship chart. The draw down plot shows that overall there is an average draw down of 0. 6% with spikes to higher draw downs. Again, if you watched my last video on the performance of these kinds of algorithms, they also have to take into consideration the moment when you are going to activate these algorithms. Try to activate them in a dip, which is harder than it looks, of course, and then let the algorithm do its work. Now, in comparison with the other trading strategies in this strategy league, this one might not have the highest profits, but then again, profits are not the only factor on which these performances are scored. Also, its risk management and other indicators are important, too. So, adding all these scores up, this strategy ends up in the top three of hypothetical best performing trading strategies. Meaning that it has the potential to make lots of money, but you should be aware of the caveats of doing algorithmic trading to take full advantage of these back test exercises and the information they provide. Now, if you found this breakdown helpful, here's what you can do next. Hit that like button because it really helps the channel and subscribe because I will continue my search for the best trading strategy. If you want to have the full back test results, the report, the strategy code and other stuff, then you can find this on my Patreon site. Nowadays, also including Discord. Remember that I also have written a book about algorithmic cryptocurrency trading for beginners. So, if this is your first time, I think the book is an excellent start to begin algorithmic trading. Thank you for watching and I will see you in the next video. Goodbye.
