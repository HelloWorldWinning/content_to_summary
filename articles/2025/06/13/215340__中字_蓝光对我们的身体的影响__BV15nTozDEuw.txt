Description:
好的，这是对文本内容的总结、核心观点、总体框架和美人鱼图。

**总结纲要 (Summary Outline):**

1.  **引言：** Dr. Jack Cruz 提出关于屏幕蓝光、科技公司与 MKUltra 项目之间存在令人震惊的联系的争议性主张。
2.  **核心主张：**
    *   现代科技屏幕普遍采用蓝光并非偶然，而是故意设计，旨在“愚弄”和“编程”用户。
    *   这种设计背后是 DARPA 的意愿，并且与大型科技公司、硅谷巨头以及军事工业复合体、CIA 和 MKUltra 项目（被描述为 4.0, 5.0 版本）紧密相连。
3.  **历史渊源与理论基础：**
    *   MKUltra 项目起源于 CIA 对心理控制的研究兴趣，部分受到纳粹医生 Kurt Plotk 使用佩奥特仙人掌进行实验的启发。
    *   CIA 对光和无线信号控制人体行为的可能性进行了研究。
    *   提及 Dr. Jose Delgado 的 Stemosiva 设备实验，该设备可通过电信号无线控制动物行为（如停止冲锋的公牛），这被视为通过外部信号控制行为的早期成功案例。
    *   宣称 Delgado 的研究进一步发现可以在不植入设备的情况下，仅通过光（特别是蓝光）来影响动物行为。
4.  **蓝光的生物学效应（负面）：**
    *   声称蓝光会破坏大脑的多巴胺奖励通路。Meta 和 Google 被提及拥有相关专利。
    *   蓝光被认为对健康有害，特别会破坏年轻男性的性激素，导致睾酮问题。
    *   现代照明（如淘汰白炽灯）和屏幕（LCD）推广了蓝光，被认为是有意为之，以利于控制。
5.  **自然光及其他光谱的生物学效应（正面）：**
    *   红光和近红外光对大脑健康和新陈代谢有益，特定波长（如 600-1000nm 的 Infrared A，特别是近红外光，以及 380nm 和 1280nm）能激活细胞光开关，优化新陈代谢。
    *   白炽灯被认为含有对身体有益的光谱（紫光、红光、紫外光），能作为蓝光的“解药”，其被淘汰的理由（高能耗、发热）被认为是掩盖了 DARPA 推广蓝光的真实目的。
    *   日光对生物体极为重要，能显著加速病人术后恢复。
6.  **光、水、磁性与生物能量：**
    *   Cruz 博士的核心原则：光、水、磁性在体内相互作用是健康的基础。
    *   阳光能直接给血液中的水（等离子体）充能，提供能量，这超越了传统的 ATP 能量系统。
    *   线粒体产生一种特殊的水（氘耗尽水），具有高介电常数，能产生更多电子。更多的电子意味着能吸收更多的光，从而改善脑功能。
    *   使用亚甲基蓝（提供电子）结合光照能改善脑功能。
7.  **生物体的内在光与光电效应：**
    *   生物体（包括人类）会产生微弱的光（生物光子），Fritz Pop 的研究证明了这一点。
    *   骨骼（胶原蛋白和羟基磷灰石）被描述为半导体，能通过光电效应和微弱的直流电来管理电流和光，参与骨骼的完全再生愈合过程，并能发射光（类似 LED）。
    *   黑色素生成（受紫外光激活）和细胞产生紫外光（生物光子）表明紫外光并非完全有毒，可能用于重要的内部信号传导。
8.  **对现代医学和科技的批判：**
    *   批评营养研究忽视光对生物体的影响。
    *   批评金属植入物干扰骨骼自然的光电愈合过程。
    *   将年轻男性普遍存在的睾酮问题直接归因于屏幕蓝光暴露。

**核心观点 (Core Point):**

Dr. Jack Cruz 坚称，由与历史心理控制项目相关的强大实体推动的、普遍存在的科技蓝光，是一种旨在损害人类健康和促进控制的故意工具，这与被现代世界忽视的自然光对生物体的至关重要益处形成鲜明对比。

**总体框架 (Overarching Framework):**

将普遍存在的现代科技现象（如屏幕蓝光）解释为由与历史心理控制项目（如 MKUltra）相关的强大组织（DARPA, CIA, 科技公司）策划的、旨在损害人类健康、剥夺人类与自然光的联系并最终达到控制目的的阴谋的一部分，同时提出一套基于光、水和磁性相互作用的、被现代医学忽视的另类生物能量模型，以强调自然光对健康的根本重要性。

 Have you ever asked yourself why it is that every screen comes out blue? They don't have red. You actually have to put software in to change it. There's a reason, my friend. You understand the game that's going on. They're dumbing you down. Why is it that every tech company has blue lit screens? I'm going to tell you the reason why is because that's how DARPA wants it. That way you can be programmed further. So, wow. Oh, no. It's even more wild than that. You haven't even got to the wild stage. This is Dr. Jack Cruz, a neurosurgeon. In a recent podcast with Danny Jones, he made some controversial statements. Pay attention because the connections he makes are truly mind-blowing. I pay attention to all of the families of the big Silicon Valley people. Why? Because they are all tied to MKUltra 4.0, 5.0. Every single one of them. And there's a reason they follow the rules of the industrial military complex because they're designed to do that. And guess what? They get that training at the universities that they went. Stanford. Harvard. There is a hidden connection between Silicon Valley, the CIA's MKUltra project and Las Vegas. Something you'd never expect. Watch this. They get together and Moses, I got an idea. Let's go build a casino in a desert. Everybody thinks he's crazy at first. Okay. So, they build Vegas. The first thing he did is he put one-armed bandits in all the casinos. He blew lit everything. Why? Because he paid attention to how people spent money. He realized when you used artificial light, it seemed like people spent more money. So, then what's the second thing he does in like 1952, 53? He starts painting all the windows in the casino black. So, you can't see outside. Can't see outside and he doesn't want to go outside. The CIA decided they needed to find out more about mind control. They were curious if there was any real science behind these claims. At this point, MKUltra was born. MKUltra was a secret project and it came from merging two main ideas. First, there was a group in Dallas interested in studying mind control. The second part came from a Nazi surgeon named Kurt Plotk who worked in 1937. Kurt believed it was possible to control people's minds using Mexican peyote, a cactus that causes hallucinations. He started experimenting with this and the CIA took an interest. The CIA also began studying other methods such as the effects of lights and wireless signals to see if they could control or influence people. Eventually, they hired a man named Sidney Gottlieb to run the MKUltra program. Gottlieb led the project from 1950 to 1953 and perhaps even longer until 1964. So, all this information from the CIA and FBI are transferred into DARPA. DARPA then takes it the next level. They go and they hire a guy in New Orleans. I told you we'd eventually come back to New Orleans. That name Alton Oster, he becomes his first in FBI asset as a surgeon. But then he becomes a CIA asset because of this issue here. They go and hire a PhD researcher named Delgado. Dr Jose Delgado was a Spanish neuroscientist who developed the Stemosiva, a device to stimulate and control brain activity wirelessly. He famously stopped the charging bull using this technology, highlighting the potential to influence behavior. And they start putting wires into the bull's head to find out can they stop and control the bull using electric signals. Why? Because they already have started to learn about Becker's work. So now this is the idea. Now they're trying to execute. They're trying to use this as a weapon. They were able to control the bull's behavior using wires connected to the brain. Specifically, they could stop the bull from attacking the matador at the crucial moment. Seeing the success of this wireless method, they wanted to see if it was possible to do the same thing without any physical wires, essentially using wireless technology to control the bull remotely. They had all the patents and everything they stole from Tesla. They also had all the Marconi's work. At the same time, member Motorola is now one of the guys that see industrial military company. They know that wireless telephony is actually coming. So they decide to employ it here first. Delgado discovered it was indeed possible to control the animal's behavior without using wires. He realized that they didn't need to perform brain surgery to implant any devices in the animal's brain. Instead, they found the way to control the animal without any direct physical connection or invasive procedures. This was a significant breakthrough because it showed that brain activity could be influenced remotely without needing to implant anything inside the brain. This was the key step. This is the step where I think your audience, you, people find it incredulous when I tell them the next step was could you do this using light and light alone? And it turns out they found out you could use blue light specifically. It actually destroys the dopamine reward tracks in your brain. Just so you know, meta and Google today own those patents. They found the way to deliver blue light through screens, perfecting the method of getting blue light into people's eyes using this technology. In the 1950s and 60s, IBM was the big tech company working on this kind of technology. They were developing liquid crystal displays, LCDs, even back then, though these screens didn't become common for the public until the 1990s. Later on, during the Obama administration, the shift from analog to digital TV further promoted the use of LCD screens, which are known to deliver blue light. Obama also pushed to ban incandescent bulbs leading to the use of new lighting that could also emit blue light. Incandescent bulbs not only have fake blue light, but they also have purple and red, which is what you need as the antidote to blue. You probably remember on your little kid, you touched the incandescent bulb, it's hot as well. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the proxy that they're using to you is, oh, well, they burn too much energy because they have UV light and red light in it. And that makes heat. So therefore, we should get rid of that do blue, but you have no idea that DARPA already want blue light everywhere so they can control you with it. That's the real answer behind this whole program. According to Dr. Jack Cruz, infrared light is very important for the brain. While blue light has a negative impact, he explains that red and infrared light can be beneficial, especially in brain surgery. There are panels you can buy that emit infrared light, but for surgery, more specific types are needed. Infrared A ranging from 600 to 1000 nanometers is essential, but near infrared light is even more crucial because it penetrates a deep brain to the brain. He also found that a photo switch in the brain can be activated using 1218 nanometer light, particularly when paired with 380 nanometer light. This combination helps trigger beneficial responses in the brain, aiding the surgery. That photo switch is actually important with 380 nanometer light. That's actually the big control switch between anabolic and catabolic metabolism. And what does that effectively mean? When you use those specific frequencies of light, you can optimize metabolism, why the patients asleep. So if any of my anesthesiologist listens to this and they want to know why I was doing what I did, I never told anybody what I was doing because I was always afraid I'd wind up in front of the medical board. But I was guaranteeing that people would wake up from anesthesia like this, because I knew that was one of the big risks that we need to have people recover fast. And it turns out if you understand the two photo switches for metabolism, which is 380 nanometer light, that controls the M-tor switch. 1280 light controls the free radical switch. Dr. Cruz says that the body manages energy at the cellular level, specifically focusing on the balance between using ATP, the main energy molecule, and dealing with free radicals. Most people don't understand this balance because they aren't familiar with mitochondrial medicine. Nitric oxide, he explains, is a free radical, which means it has an unpaired electron. When nitric oxide gets into the mitochondria, the cell's powerhouses, it actually stops ATP production. Many doctors think that ATP is always needed for energy, but Cruz says that's not entirely true. When we're exposed to sunlight, our bodies reduce ATP production. Instead, we start to rely on the sun's energy more directly. This happens because sunlight helps to energize the water in our blood plasma, which is 93% water. He explains that one of his foundational principles is about how light water and magnetism all interact in the body. When cells are able to store more light energy in their water networks, patients tend to feel better and have improved health. Essentially, Cruz is saying that sunlight combined with water in our cells plays a major role in keeping us healthy beyond just the usual ATP energy system. How did I learn all that? I learned it from the story of photosynthesis. Why? Because of chlorophyll and hemoglobin. They look exactly the same. And you said that you listened to the Umarin podcast. And I know there was a lot of science in there, but you might remember that I told you the two most important biologic semiconductors before the KT event were hemoglobin and chlorophyll. Why? Because they have a nitride cage around it. Or remember, what's the most dominant gas in the atmosphere? Turns out it's nitrogen. Dr. Cruz is explaining how energy worked in living things before there was oxygen. Back then, two important proteins acted like semiconductors, which means they could help generate electrons needed for energy. He thought about how things changed after the KT event, a big disaster that wiped out many life forms and realized there was more to the story. He understood that these semiconductor proteins were giving off light to water in the body, as Dr. Robert Beckett had found. This made the water behave like a kind of quantum battery, which means the water could store and use energy in a special, efficient way. Many nutrition studies, including those that doctors and researchers rely on, do not account for these effects of light. These studies assume they are showing how nutrition truly works in the body, but they overlook the impact of light entirely. Since light is an important factor for health, ignoring it means these studies are missing a crucial part of the picture when it comes to understanding how nutrition really affects us. Our mitochondria makes a special kind of water. It's called deuterium depleted water. You don't get any deuterium depleted water coming out of your tap at home. So what happens if you ran all the experiments with that type of water? And it turns out that water has a high dielectric constant. What does that mean in English? It means it makes more electrons. What's the story of life? The more electrons you have, the better you do. What do electrons do? More electrons you have, the more light you could absorb. When enough light enters the system, the brain can function better. When asked why he uses methylene blue, Dr. Cruz explains that it's because methylene blue helps provide more electrons. More electrons, combined with shining light on the brain, leads to improved brain function, which ultimately makes him a better surgeon. Dr. Cruz also mentions the bright blue lights used during surgery, like the xenon lights. He suggests that surgeons use a spectroscope to analyze the lights used in the operating room, like those on microscopes, headgear, or overhead lights. By doing this, they can see the light spectrum and understand how it might affect patient outcomes, as he believes the type of light used during surgery has a significant effect on recovery. I remember I specifically changed where I did surgery into a hospital that didn't have the best equipment in the world, but you know what they had? They had a courtyard that I could bring my patients outside in the sun, and the anesthesiologist didn't with me and fight with me about doing this, and they were stunned. They were like, I can't believe this guy's patients just wake up and they do great when they shouldn't. The other doctors who operate on people with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, they would be in the ICU for two or three days because they had sundowning and everything else, and I would do my subdurals and bring the patient outside, and they're like, this fucking guy's going home the next day. That is how powerful sunlight is for a biology. Did you know that our bodies create light internally? Creating light inside the body is crucial for survival, especially in environments with less sunlight like places far north, high latitudes. A biophysicist's name, Fred's Pop, conducted important research in the 1960s and 70s. Around the same time, another researcher, Dr. Robert Becker, discovered that bones have properties similar to semiconductors, especially materials that can manage electrical flow. He showed that bones are made of collagen and appetite, which act like p-type and end-type semiconductors. These two components manage electrical currents and suggested that a photoelectric effect, a process where light causes electrical changes, was happening in bones. Since Becker wasn't a physicist, he brought in a specialist possibly named Charlie Bowman to help figure it out. This work demonstrated that light and electricity were involved even in bones indicating that our bodies can generate light as part of how they function. When we check for the photoelectric effect both ways, with collagen and with appetite, it glows brown red, and when you do it the other way, it glows blue. Then that means that we should have a light signature, like for example, anytime a doctor is listening to your podcast, they're going to say, well I cut somebody open, I don't see any light. Well, you're not. You won't see it because it's ultra weak biophotons. Fritz Pop used special equipment to prove that living things, including humans, create light. To see this light, which is very faint, you need special equipment called a photo multiplier. In the 1960s, Fritz Pop created photo multipliers machines that could detect this tiny light. He then tested all kinds of living things, including leaves and other organisms, by placing them in the photo multiplied to see if they emitted light. I spent almost $100,000 translating Russian journals about scientists that were doing this work both in Japan and Russia, and found out that mitochondrial DNA actually creates light through the process of breaking electrons and protons down from food. I kept reading it and the number one thing that I remember from the papers, still to this day, that you had to have oxygen and you had to have electron chain transport working for this to happen. Melanine, the pigment in our skin, is produced by a gene called PON-C, which is activated by UV light. Fritz Pop discovered that every living cell emits very weak UV light called biophotons. This suggests that UV light is naturally produced by our bodies and is likely used for internal signaling. This challenge is the idea that UV light is purely toxic. Instead, it might be crucial for important biological processes that we don't fully understand just yet. Dermatologists not to monitor our apples because biology is making UV light. That means it's not toxic. That means it's being used for optical photonic signaling that we don't know about. We're creating light and we absorb light and we have all these proteins in us that are chromophore proteins. I said, God, our evolution wouldn't have done this if it wasn't important. You know, I started finding UVA detectors on our cornea in our skin. I never learned that in medical school. When I saw that, I'm like, there's a story here that hasn't been told. Dr. Cruz criticizes the medical implant industry, which promotes using screws, rods, and other metal parts to fix broken bones. The argument is that implants interfere with the natural healing process of bones because they mess up the bones photoelectric ability, the way bones naturally use electrical currents and light to heal. According to this, metal implants destroy the natural process. Bones are special because, unlike most body tissues, they regenerate completely without scarring. For example, if you break your arm and it heals, there's no mark inside showing where it was broken. It's as if it never happened, which is different from most other body parts. The liver is one other organ that can regrow, but this kind of complete regeneration is rare in mammals. Dr. Robert Becker did research in the 1960s to understand how bones heal. He found that our body creates a small direct current, DC, that stimulates red blood cells in the bone marrow to de-differentiate, meaning they turn into bone cells, which is how fractures heal completely without a scar. Becker also discovered that the main parts of bone, collagen and dapatite are semiconductors, meaning they can conduct electrical currents. He even found that bones can emit light, much like an LED, showing that bones use both electricity and light for healing. Another interesting thing is a testosterone problem in young men. Many people today, especially young men in their 20s and 30s, are focused on boosting testosterone levels, often through injections, seeing it as a fountain of youth for energy and vitality. This trend is growing rapidly, but there's an underlying issue behind it that isn't being addressed. Here's what Dr. Jack Cruz has to say about it. They all have pregnant bone steel syndrome from their screens. This is the basis of MK Ultra's work. It's what happens. Oh yes, my friend. It destroys your sex-dried hormones by design. And you know how we can make a prediction at somebody's... What destroys your sex? The blue light. The blue light, right? Yeah, yeah. Blue light screens, non-80VMF, RF, microwaves, take it all away. But what do you make about the sort of obsession right now with young people and this testosterone therapy? You're not listening to me. They're obsessed with tech, therefore that's why they're obsessed with that. Okay, I fixed the tech addiction, then you fixed that problem. That's it for today's video.
