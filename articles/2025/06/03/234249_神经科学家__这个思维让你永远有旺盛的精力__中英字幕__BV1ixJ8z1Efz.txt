Description:
好的，这是基于您提供的文本，以简体中文呈现的总结、核心观点、总框架和Mermaid概念图。

**核心观点：**
学习从努力本身中获取多巴胺奖励，而非仅依赖最终结果，是培养成长型思维、提升表现的关键。

**总框架：**
努力与奖励的神经生物学：从外部奖励到内在满足的思维转变

**提纲：**

一、努力的普遍挑战与传统认知
    *   努力工作通常被视为实现最终目标的手段。
    *   大多数人不喜欢纯粹的努力，而是为了某种成果（金钱、社会认可等）。

二、外部奖励的负面效应
    *   斯坦福经典实验：奖励（金星）降低了儿童对原本喜爱活动的内在兴趣（画画）。
    *   机制：关注奖杯、成绩、胜利等外部奖励会破坏整个过程。奖励引起的多巴胺短暂峰值会降低多巴胺基线，导致大脑将行为解读为“为了奖励而非享受活动本身”（外在强化）。
    *   结果：削弱对过程的享受，增加努力时的痛苦感，降低效率（无法利用多巴胺提高能量和专注），并使未来再次投入该活动变得更困难。

三、成长型思维模式（Growth Mindset）
    *   与外部奖励驱动模式相反。
    *   核心在于“努力提升自己”，将“努力本身”视为目标。
    *   研究表明，拥有成长型思维的人表现更出色，因为他们专注于过程和努力。

四、核心策略：学习从“努力本身”中获取多巴胺奖励（内在强化）
    *   这是多巴胺生物学中最强大、最普适的方面。
    *   所有人都可以培养这种能力。
    *   神经机制涉及学习在努力中释放多巴胺。

五、实践方法
    *   在经历最强烈的困难或阻力时：
        *   告诉自己：“这很痛苦。”
        *   同时重塑认知：“正因为痛苦，它将在稍后引发多巴胺释放增加，提升我的基线。”（这是一种延迟的内在奖励）
        *   强调：你是出于“选择”来做这件事的。
        *   甚至告诉自己：“我热爱它。”（即便感觉像自我欺骗，但这符合你渴望让过程感觉更好的真实愿望）
    *   这与思考终点线后的外部奖励（如冰淇淋）完全不同。

六、效益
    *   能够从阻力和挑战中引发多巴胺释放，形成正向循环。
    *   在努力过程中获得更高的能量和专注力。
    *   增强未来再次面对困难任务的内在动力。
    *   培养成长型思维，提升长期表现。

七、重要告诫：如何避免干扰
    *   不要在努力之前（预先）或之后（事后）通过其他方式（如兴奋剂、奖励等）人为刺激多巴胺。
    *   专注于学习从努力本身中触发多巴胺释放。

八、结论
    *   从努力中获取快乐的能力是多巴胺系统的核心力量，普适且可培养。

 So you can tell yourself the effort part is the good part. I know it's painful. I know this doesn't feel good, but I'm focused on this. I'm going to start to access the reward when we focus only on the trophy, only on the grade, only on the win. You undermine that entire process. The ability to access this pleasure from effort is without question the most powerful aspect of dopamine. And the beautiful thing is it's accessible to all of us. Hard work is hard. Generally, most people don't like working hard. Some people do, but most people work hard in order to achieve some end goal. End goals are terrific and rewards are terrific, whether or not they are monetary, social, or any kind. However, working hard at something for sake of a reward that comes afterward can make the hard work much more challenging and make us much less likely to lean into hard work in the future. There's a classic experiment done actually at Stanford many years ago in which children in nursery school and kindergarten drew pictures and they drew pictures because they like to draw. The researchers took kids that liked to draw and they started giving them a reward for drawing. The reward generally was a gold star or some thing that a young child would find rewarding. Then they stopped giving them the gold star and what they found is the children had a much lower tendency to draw on their own. No reward. Now remember, this was an activity that prior to receiving a reward, the children intrinsically enjoyed and selected to do. No one was telling them to draw. What this relates to is so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement. When we receive rewards, even if we give ourselves rewards for something, we tend to associate less pleasure with the actual activity itself that evoked the reward. If you get a peak in dopamine from a reward, it's going to lower your baseline and the cognitive interpretation is that you didn't really do the activity because you enjoy the activity. You did it for the reward. Now this is the antithesis of growth mindset. My colleague at Stanford, Carol Dweck, as many of you know, has come up with this incredible theory and principle and it actually goes beyond theory and principle called growth mindset, which is this striving to be better, to be in this mindset of I'm not there yet, but striving itself is the end goal. And that of course delivers you to tremendous performances been observed over and over and over again that people that have growth mindset end up performing very well because they're focused on the effort itself. And all of us can cultivate growth mindset. The neural mechanism of cultivating growth mindset involves learning to access the rewards from effort and doing. And that's hard to do because you have to tell yourself, okay, this effort is great. This effort is pleasureful, even though you might actually be in a state of physical pain from the exercise, or I can recall this from college just feeling like I wanted to get up from my desk, but forcing myself to study forcing myself and forcing myself what you find over time is that you can evoke dopamine release from the friction and the challenge that you happen to be in. You completely eliminate the ability to generate those circuits and the rewarding process of being able to reward friction while in effort, if you are focused only on the goal that comes at the end. So if you say, oh, I'm going to do this very hard thing. And I'm going to push and push and push and push for that end goal that comes later. Not only do you enjoy the process of what you're doing less, you actually make it more painful while you're engaging in it, you make yourself less efficient at it, because if you were able to access dopamine while in effort, dopamine has all these incredible properties of increasing the amount of energy in our body, and in our mind our ability to focus. But also, you're undermining your ability to lean back into that activity the next time the next time you need twice as much coffee and three times as much loud music and four times as much energy drink and the social connection just to get out the door in order to do the run or to study. So what's more beneficial is to attach the feeling of friction and effort to an internally generated reward system. You're not just pursuing the things that are innately pleasurable. So you can tell yourself the effort part is the good part. I know it's painful. I know this doesn't feel good, but I'm focused on this. I'm going to start to access the reward. You will find the rewards, meaning the dopamine release inside of effort. If you repeat this over and over again. And what's beautiful about it is that it starts to become reflexive for all types of effort. When we focus only on the trophy, only on the grade, only on the win, as the reward, you undermine that entire process. So how do you do this? You do this in those moments of the most intense friction, you tell yourself, this is very painful. And because it's painful, it will evoke an increase in dopamine release later, meaning it will increase my baseline in dopamine. But you also have to tell yourself that in that moment, you are doing it by choice. And you're doing it because you love it. And I know that sounds like lying to yourself. And in some ways, it is lying to yourself. But it's lying to yourself in the context of a truth, which is that you want it to feel better. You want it to feel even pleasureful. Now, this is very far and away different from thinking about the reward that comes at the end, the hot fudge Sunday for after you cross the finish line. And you can replace hot fudge Sunday with whatever reward happens to be appealing to you. We revere people who are capable of doing what I'm describing. David Goggins comes to mind as a really good example. Many of you are probably familiar with David Goggins, former Navy SEAL, who essentially has made a post military career career out of explaining and sharing his process of turning the effort into the reward. The ability to access this pleasure from effort is without question, the most powerful aspect of dopamine in our biology of dopamine. And the beautiful thing is, it's accessible to all of us. But just to highlight the things that can interfere with and prevent you from getting dopamine release from effort itself. Don't spike dopamine prior to engaging an effort. And don't spike dopamine after engaging an effort. Learn to spike your dopamine from effort itself.
