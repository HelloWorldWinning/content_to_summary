好的，这是对您提供的MicroStrategy (MSTR) 技术分析文本的总结，采用简体中文，并包含所需的结构、核心观点、框架和Mermaid图。

**MicroStrategy (MSTR) 技术分析总结**

1.  **概述:** 本视频对MicroStrategy (MSTR) 股票进行了技术分析，重点关注日线图和周线图，并结合公司最新的比特币收购策略和比特币自身的市场走势进行综合评估。

2.  **MSTR日线图分析:**
    *   MSTR目前在中300美元区域的关键支撑位附近震荡，今日有小幅上涨。
    *   图表形态显示可能正在构筑又一个下跌腿，潜在目标区域是310美元，该位置是之前的突破区域，被视为强支撑。
    *   这种潜在的短期看跌情景部分是由于比特币目前的短期技术疲软态势。
    *   然而，由于价格已触及支撑位，不能确定一定会跌至目标区域，也可能在此企稳或小幅回调后直接反弹。未触及310美元目标反而可能被视为更强的看涨信号。

3.  **MicroStrategy 策略与新闻:**
    *   公司近期推出了新的产品“Stride”(STRD)，加上原有的Strike和Strife，构成了多层面的证券发行体系，旨在持续募集资金用于收购比特币。
    *   MicroStrategy近期又购买了705枚比特币，这只是本月收购的开始。
    *   自一月以来，公司平均每月收购20-25k枚比特币，预计六月底前还会购买约19k枚。
    *   公司的比特币收购策略非常激进且坚定，长期来看对MSTR是积极的。
    *   公司目前共持有580,955枚比特币，相对于比特币2100万的总量，持仓巨大。

4.  **比特币 (BTC) 走势分析:**
    *   比特币目前处于关键的技术位置，已跌破先前的阻力位106k美元，短期风险较高。
    *   短期内可能下探至97k美元甚至更低。
    *   需尽快回到106k美元上方才能恢复短期看涨信心。
    *   目前短期市场控制权掌握在空头手中。

5.  **MSTR周线图分析:**
    *   周线图显示过去三周有所回调，本周可能继续。
    *   价格正向EMA（约341美元）靠近，可能在此获得支撑。
    *   长期趋势呈“阶梯式”稳步上升，与2021年的指数级上涨不同，这种模式预示着趋势将更持久。
    *   长期看涨趋势线仍然有效，价格可能回踩趋势线，形成“空头陷阱”后再大幅上涨。
    *   整体而言，MSTR的长期技术形态依然看涨。

6.  **核心观点总结:**
    尽管MicroStrategy股票短期可能受比特币走势影响出现回调，但其积极的比特币收购策略和技术图表（特别是周线图）显示长期看涨趋势依然稳固。

7.  **总体框架:**
    技术分析（日线/周线图）结合公司基本面（比特币收购策略、新产品）和相关资产（比特币）走势，对MicroStrategy (MSTR) 股票进行综合评估。

Please trade at your own risk. only. Please trade at your own risk. Here we have the daily chart for Micro Here we have the daily chart for Micro Here we have the daily chart for Micro Strategy and you see that there was a Strategy and you see that there was a Strategy and you see that there was a slight gain today. Nothing to write home slight gain today. Nothing to write home slight gain today. Nothing to write home about. Uh looks like possibly we could about. Uh looks like possibly we could about. Uh looks like possibly we could be setting up for uh actually another be setting up for uh actually another be setting up for uh actually another leg down. We are bouncing off of leg down. We are bouncing off of leg down. We are bouncing off of potential support. So, this was the potential support. So, this was the potential support. So, this was the prior range right over here. And you see prior range right over here. And you see prior range right over here. And you see that price broke out of the range. that price broke out of the range. that price broke out of the range. However, it doubled the size. Uh it made However, it doubled the size. Uh it made However, it doubled the size. Uh it made a measure move target and now we're a measure move target and now we're a measure move target and now we're bouncing off that level. There was minor bouncing off that level. There was minor bouncing off that level. There was minor support here and then we've been support here and then we've been support here and then we've been stabilizing right at the mid300s uh for stabilizing right at the mid300s uh for stabilizing right at the mid300s uh for the past um about a week now. So, let's the past um about a week now. So, let's the past um about a week now. So, let's see if this does break down lower see if this does break down lower see if this does break down lower because it possibly can due to this because it possibly can due to this because it possibly can due to this being a correction pattern. You can see being a correction pattern. You can see being a correction pattern. You can see that price made one leg up right here that price made one leg up right here that price made one leg up right here and then price pulled back and then we and then price pulled back and then we and then price pulled back and then we made the second leg up. That's almost a made the second leg up. That's almost a made the second leg up. That's almost a perfect measure move. If you go on a perfect measure move. If you go on a perfect measure move. If you go on a lower time frame, it looks like a lower time frame, it looks like a lower time frame, it looks like a correction. You can see that there we correction. You can see that there we correction. You can see that there we have a strong move down and then we have have a strong move down and then we have have a strong move down and then we have a leg up followed by a drop and another a leg up followed by a drop and another a leg up followed by a drop and another leg up followed by a potential another leg up followed by a potential another leg up followed by a potential another drop. Uh so, it's like a two-legged drop. Uh so, it's like a two-legged drop. Uh so, it's like a two-legged pullback. Looks like a pullback just pullback. Looks like a pullback just pullback. Looks like a pullback just like over here was two legs, one like over here was two legs, one like over here was two legs, one pullback, two and then we went up pullback, two and then we went up pullback, two and then we went up higher. Same thing in reverse. We have higher. Same thing in reverse. We have higher. Same thing in reverse. We have one leg pull back two and then one leg pull back two and then one leg pull back two and then potentially go down lower. Especially potentially go down lower. Especially potentially go down lower. Especially with Bitcoin looking kind of weak as of with Bitcoin looking kind of weak as of with Bitcoin looking kind of weak as of right now. Again, is it guaranteed to do right now. Again, is it guaranteed to do right now. Again, is it guaranteed to do uh work out that way? No, it's not uh work out that way? No, it's not uh work out that way? No, it's not because we are at support. So, you can't because we are at support. So, you can't because we are at support. So, you can't just uh 100% believe that it will break just uh 100% believe that it will break just uh 100% believe that it will break down lower because you know this is at down lower because you know this is at down lower because you know this is at support and it may hold where we don't support and it may hold where we don't support and it may hold where we don't see that leg down. But let's say we do see that leg down. But let's say we do see that leg down. But let's say we do see that leg down. Well, all this would see that leg down. Well, all this would see that leg down. Well, all this would just be one leg down right here. And just be one leg down right here. And just be one leg down right here. And then we clone this over to potentially then we clone this over to potentially then we clone this over to potentially the top and that would take us right the top and that would take us right the top and that would take us right down to um 311, which makes sense down to um 311, which makes sense down to um 311, which makes sense because that's where uh there's also because that's where uh there's also because that's where uh there's also strong support or that's where the prior strong support or that's where the prior strong support or that's where the prior breakout was. So a lot of times price breakout was. So a lot of times price breakout was. So a lot of times price likes to come back to these breakout likes to come back to these breakout likes to come back to these breakout zones. So you see that price had this zones. So you see that price had this zones. So you see that price had this huge move up higher. Where did it break huge move up higher. Where did it break huge move up higher. Where did it break out of previously? Broke out right over out of previously? Broke out right over out of previously? Broke out right over here. those resistance here, a failed here. those resistance here, a failed here. those resistance here, a failed breakout here, resistance here, those breakout here, resistance here, those breakout here, resistance here, those support in the past. This is a key level support in the past. This is a key level support in the past. This is a key level it looks like at the 310 level. So, we it looks like at the 310 level. So, we it looks like at the 310 level. So, we may see price come back to that level, may see price come back to that level, may see price come back to that level, test it, and then maybe go up from there test it, and then maybe go up from there test it, and then maybe go up from there or price does continue down lower, but or price does continue down lower, but or price does continue down lower, but maybe it doesn't make it that far, which maybe it doesn't make it that far, which maybe it doesn't make it that far, which is even more bullish if if we don't see is even more bullish if if we don't see is even more bullish if if we don't see a price reach the target uh towards the a price reach the target uh towards the a price reach the target uh towards the downside. Uh so, potentially uh further downside. Uh so, potentially uh further downside. Uh so, potentially uh further weakness can develop on the chart. weakness can develop on the chart. weakness can develop on the chart. However, I wouldn't can't 100% say that However, I wouldn't can't 100% say that However, I wouldn't can't 100% say that will occur because we are at support. will occur because we are at support. will occur because we are at support. What can also happen is we do see maybe What can also happen is we do see maybe What can also happen is we do see maybe consolidation or slightly drop down in consolidation or slightly drop down in consolidation or slightly drop down in price and then we see a rally develop price and then we see a rally develop price and then we see a rally develop from from from there. But I would not be surprised to there. But I would not be surprised to there. But I would not be surprised to see a drop down lower to 310 uh if it see a drop down lower to 310 uh if it see a drop down lower to 310 uh if it does does does occur. Micro Strategy also released a um occur. Micro Strategy also released a um occur. Micro Strategy also released a um new offering. They call it stride str new offering. They call it stride str new offering. They call it stride str just recently actually a few minutes ago just recently actually a few minutes ago just recently actually a few minutes ago by Michael Sailor. So now they're going by Michael Sailor. So now they're going by Michael Sailor. So now they're going to have strike, strife and stride. So to have strike, strife and stride. So to have strike, strife and stride. So basically just more opportunities to basically just more opportunities to basically just more opportunities to acquire Bitcoin acquire Bitcoin acquire Bitcoin um in the future selling you know these um in the future selling you know these um in the future selling you know these securities and raise capital uh to securities and raise capital uh to securities and raise capital uh to acquire acquire acquire Bitcoin. As you can see here they also Bitcoin. As you can see here they also Bitcoin. As you can see here they also did purchase more Bitcoin. This has not did purchase more Bitcoin. This has not did purchase more Bitcoin. This has not been updated yet, but they did been updated yet, but they did been updated yet, but they did purchase 705. Just a small amount to purchase 705. Just a small amount to purchase 705. Just a small amount to start off the month. Like I said before, start off the month. Like I said before, start off the month. Like I said before, I think I said maybe like 2 3 weeks ago. I think I said maybe like 2 3 weeks ago. I think I said maybe like 2 3 weeks ago. Uh I did the average since the beginning Uh I did the average since the beginning Uh I did the average since the beginning of the year. It's about 20 to 25, 000 of the year. It's about 20 to 25, 000 of the year. It's about 20 to 25, 000 Bitcoin a month. So most likely we're Bitcoin a month. So most likely we're Bitcoin a month. So most likely we're going to see another probably 20, 000 going to see another probably 20, 000 going to see another probably 20, 000 come out this month as well um of come out this month as well um of come out this month as well um of Bitcoin. So, I say this is a very small Bitcoin. So, I say this is a very small Bitcoin. So, I say this is a very small amount, but I would say there's a good amount, but I would say there's a good amount, but I would say there's a good chance we're going to see another, let's chance we're going to see another, let's chance we're going to see another, let's say, 19, 000 more Bitcoin purchased by say, 19, 000 more Bitcoin purchased by say, 19, 000 more Bitcoin purchased by the end of June. Uh, so they're on their the end of June. Uh, so they're on their the end of June. Uh, so they're on their way to get about 20 to 25, 000 a month as way to get about 20 to 25, 000 a month as way to get about 20 to 25, 000 a month as of right now. They've been doing that of right now. They've been doing that of right now. They've been doing that since basically January. So, overall since basically January. So, overall since basically January. So, overall very strong. Metaplanet also bought some very strong. Metaplanet also bought some very strong. Metaplanet also bought some more Bitcoin. I'll cover that in the more Bitcoin. I'll cover that in the more Bitcoin. I'll cover that in the next video for um today. So, overall, next video for um today. So, overall, next video for um today. So, overall, you know, uh they're very aggressive in you know, uh they're very aggressive in you know, uh they're very aggressive in the strategy. uh they're not holding the strategy. uh they're not holding the strategy. uh they're not holding back. They're going to continue to back. They're going to continue to back. They're going to continue to acquire more Bitcoin, which is only acquire more Bitcoin, which is only acquire more Bitcoin, which is only long-term good. Uh let's take a look at long-term good. Uh let's take a look at long-term good. Uh let's take a look at the weekly chart or let's take a look at the weekly chart or let's take a look at the weekly chart or let's take a look at Bitcoin's chart real quick. Let me Bitcoin's chart real quick. Let me Bitcoin's chart real quick. Let me mention that. So, you see that Bitcoin mention that. So, you see that Bitcoin mention that. So, you see that Bitcoin is hanging on the edge right now. It's is hanging on the edge right now. It's is hanging on the edge right now. It's below the prior resistance zone, which below the prior resistance zone, which below the prior resistance zone, which is not a good sign. It's not the end of is not a good sign. It's not the end of is not a good sign. It's not the end of the world. Uh we're kind of just the world. Uh we're kind of just the world. Uh we're kind of just chopping back and forth here. we could chopping back and forth here. we could chopping back and forth here. we could just pop back up, but if we do continue just pop back up, but if we do continue just pop back up, but if we do continue down lower, I mean, this can come back down lower, I mean, this can come back down lower, I mean, this can come back down all the way to the 97 and maybe down all the way to the 97 and maybe down all the way to the 97 and maybe even lower from there. So, again, um even lower from there. So, again, um even lower from there. So, again, um this is in a precarious position where this is in a precarious position where this is in a precarious position where it could potentially drop down lower it could potentially drop down lower it could potentially drop down lower unless we see price immediately get back unless we see price immediately get back unless we see price immediately get back above the 106 level because that is the above the 106 level because that is the above the 106 level because that is the prior all-time high zone. We need to get prior all-time high zone. We need to get prior all-time high zone. We need to get we need to see price get back above that we need to see price get back above that we need to see price get back above that zone for me to be uh really bullish zone for me to be uh really bullish zone for me to be uh really bullish again uh for Bitcoin in the short term. again uh for Bitcoin in the short term. again uh for Bitcoin in the short term. Right now, bears have control of the Right now, bears have control of the Right now, bears have control of the market in the short term for Bitcoin, market in the short term for Bitcoin, market in the short term for Bitcoin, Treasury companies, and Bitcoin. So, Treasury companies, and Bitcoin. So, Treasury companies, and Bitcoin. So, let's see what happens. It's starting to let's see what happens. It's starting to let's see what happens. It's starting to break this downward trend line. Maybe we break this downward trend line. Maybe we break this downward trend line. Maybe we broke it, retest, and then push up off broke it, retest, and then push up off broke it, retest, and then push up off of it. Uh, who knows what exactly will of it. Uh, who knows what exactly will of it. Uh, who knows what exactly will happen, but overall, it's not the end of happen, but overall, it's not the end of happen, but overall, it's not the end of the world, even if we do see a slight the world, even if we do see a slight the world, even if we do see a slight drop. And Micro Strategy may or may not drop. And Micro Strategy may or may not drop. And Micro Strategy may or may not get this drop either. Take a look at the get this drop either. Take a look at the get this drop either. Take a look at the weekly weekly weekly chart. Move all the drawings. Let's go chart. Move all the drawings. Let's go chart. Move all the drawings. Let's go to the log scale. And the the past three to the log scale. And the the past three to the log scale. And the the past three weeks have been down. This week uh has weeks have been down. This week uh has weeks have been down. This week uh has just started. Maybe it'll be another red just started. Maybe it'll be another red just started. Maybe it'll be another red week. Letting that EMA catch up, which week. Letting that EMA catch up, which week. Letting that EMA catch up, which is right around the 341 level. So, let is right around the 341 level. So, let is right around the 341 level. So, let that EMA catch up. We could maybe see a that EMA catch up. We could maybe see a that EMA catch up. We could maybe see a spike down through it like a wick and spike down through it like a wick and spike down through it like a wick and then a wick off of it, then a wick off of it, then a wick off of it, rejection in the future. Uh but overall, rejection in the future. Uh but overall, rejection in the future. Uh but overall, still just taking his time. It's a very still just taking his time. It's a very still just taking his time. It's a very slow trend. Uh you see it's a nice slow trend. Uh you see it's a nice slow trend. Uh you see it's a nice staircase pattern instead of this bull staircase pattern instead of this bull staircase pattern instead of this bull market right here was kind of just every market right here was kind of just every market right here was kind of just every week was practically up into the high of week was practically up into the high of week was practically up into the high of February 2021. This bull market right February 2021. This bull market right February 2021. This bull market right over here it was kind of like an over here it was kind of like an over here it was kind of like an exponential runup. A lot of times those exponential runup. A lot of times those exponential runup. A lot of times those don't last that long. This one, you don't last that long. This one, you don't last that long. This one, you know, it's a staircase pattern. Um he's know, it's a staircase pattern. Um he's know, it's a staircase pattern. Um he's taking his time. It's going up, taking his time. It's going up, taking his time. It's going up, stabilizing, going up, stabilizing. It's stabilizing, going up, stabilizing. It's stabilizing, going up, stabilizing. It's going up, stabil kind of just taking his going up, stabil kind of just taking his going up, stabil kind of just taking his time. So, this is going to play out time. So, this is going to play out time. So, this is going to play out longer than people want or they think. longer than people want or they think. longer than people want or they think. But as right now, the trend is still But as right now, the trend is still But as right now, the trend is still your friend until it ends. I say it's your friend until it ends. I say it's your friend until it ends. I say it's still up. Trend lines are still bullish still up. Trend lines are still bullish still up. Trend lines are still bullish in the long term. Uh we can probably in the long term. Uh we can probably in the long term. Uh we can probably come back to retest this trend line come back to retest this trend line come back to retest this trend line right here. Uh maybe create some sort of right here. Uh maybe create some sort of right here. Uh maybe create some sort of short short short trap and then, you know, price rockets trap and then, you know, price rockets trap and then, you know, price rockets up higher. So, it looks like that's what up higher. So, it looks like that's what up higher. So, it looks like that's what price is setting up to do. Uh overall, price is setting up to do. Uh overall, price is setting up to do. Uh overall, it still looks bullish in the long term. it still looks bullish in the long term. it still looks bullish in the long term. So solid from Micro Strategy on the So solid from Micro Strategy on the So solid from Micro Strategy on the daily and weekly charts went over the daily and weekly charts went over the daily and weekly charts went over the daily chart. Potentially we could see daily chart. Potentially we could see daily chart. Potentially we could see lower prices, but I wouldn't be so sure lower prices, but I wouldn't be so sure lower prices, but I wouldn't be so sure about that. I just want to bring it up about that. I just want to bring it up about that. I just want to bring it up just in case it does happen. If price just in case it does happen. If price just in case it does happen. If price does drop down to the 3 310 level, it does drop down to the 3 310 level, it does drop down to the 3 310 level, it was on the chart that it would occur, was on the chart that it would occur, was on the chart that it would occur, but just as likely as it can drop down but just as likely as it can drop down but just as likely as it can drop down lower, we are at support. So we may not lower, we are at support. So we may not lower, we are at support. So we may not see that flush down lower. see that flush down lower. see that flush down lower. went over Bitcoin's uh new or excuse me, went over Bitcoin's uh new or excuse me, went over Bitcoin's uh new or excuse me, Micro Stratey's new offering uh Stride Micro Stratey's new offering uh Stride Micro Stratey's new offering uh Stride STRD that brings three offerings uh STRD that brings three offerings uh STRD that brings three offerings uh besides the actual stock MSTR uh for besides the actual stock MSTR uh for besides the actual stock MSTR uh for people to buy. Stride, Stride, Strike, people to buy. Stride, Stride, Strike, people to buy. Stride, Stride, Strike, and Strife. whenever they bought more and Strife. whenever they bought more and Strife. whenever they bought more Bitcoin um just released more Bitcoin um just released more Bitcoin um just released more Bitcoin or uh released that they bought Bitcoin or uh released that they bought Bitcoin or uh released that they bought more Bitcoin more Bitcoin more Bitcoin uh brings the total up to uh brings the total up to uh brings the total up to 580, 955 for one publicly traded company 580, 955 for one publicly traded company 580, 955 for one publicly traded company in the world with the total supply ever in the world with the total supply ever in the world with the total supply ever 21 million. So you can already see how 21 million. So you can already see how 21 million. So you can already see how monstrous they have become already. So monstrous they have become already. So monstrous they have become already. So overall things still look good just overall things still look good just overall things still look good just taking his time and that's all I have taking his time and that's all I have taking his time and that's all I have for today. Let me know in your thoughts for today. Let me know in your thoughts for today.
