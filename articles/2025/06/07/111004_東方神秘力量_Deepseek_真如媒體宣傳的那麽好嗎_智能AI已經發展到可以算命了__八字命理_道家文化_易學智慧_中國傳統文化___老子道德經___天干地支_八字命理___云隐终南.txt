WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en Good evening fellow Taoists, today is the first day of the Lunar New Year, the Ding Chou month of the year Jia Chen, the Wuxu day, and it will soon be the Jihai day. It will be the second day of the Lunar New Year. How many more days are there? How many more days are there until the Yin month of the Si year? I want to share something today. The Taoist priest was just rushing to test it, so he just remembered it and said a few words. A fellow Taoist sent a link to the Taoist Priest to try it out. He said that the horoscopes for this thing were basically consistent with the results given to him by the Taoist Priest. This aroused the Taoist Priest's interest and intrigued the Taoist Priest to see what this thing was. Son, he said this is quite serious. What is called deep search? Deep search. This thing called deepseek caused the stock market of Renxun Huang (Nvidia) that we shared a few days ago to plummet. Let the Taoist priest take a look at what is going on. Of course, the Taoist priest is not interested in their stock market. Interested, but I heard that he can criticize Taoist priest, so he is tinkering here. It is said that this is a kind of thing that shocked Wall Street, caused all AI-related projects, stock prices plummeted, and Trump just released what Starry Sky ( Stargate The plans for a billion-dollar AI world are about to come to naught, which also caused the stock of Nvidia, the god of computing power and the king of graphics cards, which I shared just two days ago, to fall by 17%. What kind of concept is this 17%? It fell to 600 billion US dollars. Fellow Taoist It's a good thing that I have left many messages for the Taoist leader. He has left many messages just in the past two or three days, and it was not left by a Taoist friend. I dug up the previous horoscope and said it was Chou Yue. He left a message saying this. How? Because today’s focus is not on Lao Huang’s eight The word is talking about this smart AI, this mysterious project of our Dongfang, which also makes Musk unable to sleep. Musk posted a message saying that he is optimistic about this thing, but Musk probably always feels a little big-headed, and secretly hates it in his heart. He must do it himself and not let the old man do it again. Huang fooled around to buy, buy, buy because he spent so much money on buying, buying, buying. It is said that he has now researched and found that this level is not up to the level of the intelligent AI that our fellow Taoists recommend to the Taoist Master, the mysterious power of the East. What about this intelligent AI? open AI and Ultraman are all confused. Ultraman has also fallen out of favor. Ultraman said bitterly: " Copying homework is naturally more time-consuming (not) troublesome than writing homework. It 's like a Taoist priest. To be honest. " I haven’t paid much attention to the technology circle in a few years and I’m not too interested in this aspect. I always feel that most people are still speculating on concepts or harvesting, but this time I can’t stand it. Some Taoist friends are following it, pushing it, and even coding the backend of the test. Send to Taoist Priest Let the Taoist priest take a look. The Taoist priest first moved bricks, then moved bricks, climbed up the wall, did some homework, and then downloaded another one. Actually, we don’t have to go over to download it. You can just download it yourself. If you don’t know how to download, then you can You don’t need to listen to what the Taoist priest shared today. After the Taoist priest approved it, he threw in the horoscope. Don’t tell me. The result of the approval is quite similar. What is this guy? What year and month were you born? because Is it true solar time when you were born? Then it is corrected according to the place of birth, what is your favorite god, etc. , etc. , etc. , so I feel that the template is longer than the Taoist form and has the same shape. This is my initial feeling. It is a very systematic thing. The Taoist priest was a little confused at the time. The Taoist priest was probably no less surprised than Musk and Ultraman when they saw this software. I said this is just like the 8 approved by the Taoist priest. The characters are basically the same, right? Doesn’t this belong to the Taoist priest? What will happen to the Taoist priest in the future? The Taoist priest has no work to do, so the Taoist priest stayed up for half the night and took 10 horoscopes and 10 horoscopes in a row. The test was roughly 5 counts as 5, but it is actually 6. The result is correct. The result mentioned by the Taoist priest does not refer to his complete and complete horoscope. It is probably too exhausting for him to measure it even with a software, but he can measure it. Like and avoid generosity This means that if a teacher has a basic knowledge of horoscopes and you can expand appropriately based on his results, at least you will have a starting point. If you are a novice who has just learned or said a For those who don’t understand at all, you may be fooled by him and think that this is a very good thing and you can approve it. But the Taoist priest has to say something. From a professional point of view, we don’t need to say that it is special. From a professional point of view, from the perspective of normal horoscope analysis, this is really not allowed, because if you think of it as 10, you will be wrong about half of it. Some Taoist friends may say that you should forgive and support new things. It's normal to be half wrong if you want to say so. But the Taoist priest also said that the probability of you being half wrong about horoscopes is a bit unbearable, isn't it? Then if it happens to be the one you put on the table, it is wrong. This is One kind and the other, if according to the horoscope and Yi Xue, there is such a truth, the yin and yang are the same as the half, in other words, it is not necessary to say whether his artificial intelligence is intelligent or not. Normally, it is called a fool's intelligence. It may be half, in other words, he is not intelligent. With any computing power, if you ask him to blindly criticize him, he may be half-right. This is the truth. So you can understand that half-right horoscopes can be understood as his basic Basically, it’s all wrong. People can’t understand this. They gradually understood it. The Taoist priest had a good letter and asked him to look at Liu Yao. He was very sincere and said that it was indeed unreadable. Then he just gave some basic knowledge on how to read Liu Yao. What is the Six Yao? What is the Six Yao for divination? That makes no sense. Of course, from this point of view, if he criticizes the Bazi, it is indeed the Bazi. He is not telling the Taoist priest what the Bazi is. Which piece of basic knowledge does it come from? This is the result of the previous AI intelligence given to Taoist priests, especially the Du Niang or other mentally retarded artificial intelligence that you use now. As soon as you input it, all it gives you is knowledge. Why would we use it if we don’t use it for knowledge? There are even some former Taoist priests, right? I didn’t use this test before because our internal Apple and other things were blocked, so it would automatically jump to Baidu as soon as I entered it, which would make the director half crazy. At least at this point, this software is still OK. It is indeed what you asked about. He gave it to you, but the result he gave you may not be correct. But how can I put this aside? Apart from the accuracy of the results, he is quite reliable. What is so reliable is that the process of his batch approval is completely based on a batch batch process and he will even post his thinking process. Normally, it would be like a teacher or a Taoist priest criticizing the eight-character thinking process. How to start from where? How do you start with the block and then push it out? It's just that it's wrong for him to push it out, but that's not important. Taoist priest, let's not talk about that block first. Let's say that at least he looks decent. It's a bit like a child learning something, but although he learns it well, It's not like that, but I'm working hard towards that meaning. Of course, the Taoist priest also said it. The Taoist priest said just now that he was right. What are those five? The pattern is relatively simple and very clear. You may have just learned the horoscopes and you will know that this horoscope is such a method of marking. He really got it right. But if there is a slightly special pattern, for example, if there is a Sanhe Sanhui, or there is a relationship between punishment and harm, or there is some offset between them, or this kind of exclusive and extremely prosperous, he basically cannot approve it. So that's why Based on this, if you use it to feel like a person studying Yili, it is okay. But if you really want him to give you a result, it may really trick you, because as long as you make the wrong preferences and taboos in the early stage, he will give it to you later. Thousands of words, wow, your life advice even includes what the Taoist priest said. If you like fire, you should wear red. If you like water, if it’s okay, just raise a fish to wash gold. You can do whatever you want. He gave it to you. Then you said that if you like water, Don't let him admit the mistake behind him What's the point of giving it to you? Of course, the Taoist priest also asked not to be too high. When the Taoist priest climbed over the wall, I saw that there were many comments from fellow Taoists, saying that this is the rise of China, and this is the praise of China's science and technology community. It is said that it took only one year under the blockade of various forces in the west. Indeed, it took only more than a year to overtake in a corner. It exceeded the scientific research results of the world's top AI companies for many years, and the cost was not enough for them. 1% is even said to be 1/1, 000. It is said that only 5 million is used. What is the concept? Even 5 million is not enough to set up a small company. Although it is US dollars, Musk said that Trump said it would cost 100 billion US dollars to build this kind of company. The computing center and the level of this intelligent AI has at least reached or even exceeded them in some aspects in many aspects, including his open What other GPT does AI have? 4. 0, etc. But the Taoist Master here is questioning something. He said that this thing is not just about computing power, but also how he obtained the data for his training in the early stage. Maybe the Taoist Master did not check it carefully. I will check it someday. That's all. The training of the model requires a preliminary accumulation of big data. Just take Daochang's example. Just for example, his calculation ability is not enough. He needs to do enough questions, for example, 1, 000 questions, 10, 000 questions, 1 million questions, and 10 million questions before he can answer this question well. So who provided him with the original horoscopes? There shouldn't be such a possibility for the data, right? How could he search for these original data? He couldn't search it. Just like The data we batch can only be stored in our internal thing. WeChat cannot open it to them, and it is impossible for others to open it to them. They currently do not have such an open platform on the market for others to explain clearly. Of course, this training model may also be one of the reasons why he failed to approve the 8-character approval. Of course, from this point of view Of course, it is either their shortcomings or their strengths. Then the Taoist priest can change his mind. If they really have enough data for training, can he accurately grade the horoscopes or grade the horoscopes at the level of the teacher? Isn't this possible? The Taoist priest has doubts. Of course, except for the large-scale praise in our country, There are also some people in the West who say that those who copy our homework are similar to what Ultraman said. Isn’t it faster to copy homework? Then we are struggling to do our homework. Isn’t it faster for you to copy? etc. It's also quite sour. Of course, they have their reasons for being sour. Taoist priest has shared this before. Everything is based on what Lao Tzu said. The Tao of Tao gives rise to one, one, two, three, and three. The most primitive Tao, one, is the most difficult. But one, two, is okay, because if you have ideas and funds, you can go out and do two, three, which is relatively okay. It would be easier to have three lives and ten thousand. In fact, what we just mentioned as deepseek is possible. The Taoist priest just said that After all, the Taoist master has not done in-depth research and is not professional. According to the sharing rules of the Tao, it should be a stage of three lives and ten thousand. So speaking of it, he was able to launch it in more than a year. Others may have spent 10 or 20 years to research it. Even though they are all closed source, you still have something to stand on the shoulders of a giant. The feasibility of certain cars can also be studied. Just like if your car ran away on the road, although you didn’t give me the authorization to do what you did with your car, I also know that the car has four wheels with a sofa on top. So, let’s talk about reality. This step does belong to the three-generation and all-creation stage. So relatively speaking, there is a fundamental support behind its rapid development, right? Of course, there may be other Taoist priests who will talk about it later. Of course, there is also a slightly more professional one. He will talk about why this time we are talking about deep exploration and this intelligent AI was so popular as soon as it was launched. Everyone has welcomed it as it is distributed, decentralized and open source. To put it simply, what Jobs created is purely centralized. It means that it is only tied to itself and you can only use it on it. You don’t know how it was created and how far it has developed. You don’t know whether it’s righteous or evil, good or evil, etc. I know, but what we are doing is open source, and it is thrown directly to you. You know how this is made, and it is distributed, so you can build it yourself based on this. Of course, each has its own advantages. We have always had it. Said that this kind of distributed open source will promote his development faster A development, but from the past until now, there are two factions. And some say that this must be closed source. For example, Apple insists on closed source software and hardware. It is closed source and developed by itself. This belongs to the two major schools of intelligent AI. This is the truth. What does open source mean? All of us are involved. What I might be talking about is beating the old master to death with a stick. What is the importance of closing the source? I studied behind closed doors. Don’t worry about how I researched it. I have a special skill when I go out. If someone comes up with a spade and a stick to hit you, you, a martial arts master, may not be able to withstand it. Most of these retail investors are decentralized and open source, but don’t mislead everyone into thinking that open source is purely retail. Some of the open source ones are also industry customers, and they all have large shares. For example, Said that he used open source to finally create their entire industry The possibility of such a semi-open source and semi-closed source is also very large and exists. The director just said that the difference in such a model is not a difference in funds and the number of servers. Of course, if you understand If not, everyone can understand that it is an assembly machine or a brand machine or even The difference between them and Apple is roughly the difference between distributed and centralized computer rooms. Some people say that this time Lao Huang just cried. Didn't he cry? He almost didn't vomit blood. That guy had hundreds of billions. It’s really sad to say that Lao Huang doesn’t say 2024. 2024 It’s not just passed, don’t count it as just passed. This belongs to the lunar calendar or this social boundary of 2025. According to this solar term, it has not passed yet. It belongs to the month of Buzi and Chou. The month of Yin and Mao has not yet arrived. Of course, it gave him another heavy blow. Some say that Nvidia is bad, some say it is good. Why? Just say whether you are closed source, open source, centralized or distributed, do you have to use computing power? Use computing power. Then Old Huang would be happy Do you have to use a graphics card, so you have to be the target of Lao Huang's next harvest. But this is just for the bubbles that Lao Huang blew up, or those under Lao Huang, such as Lao Temusk, what do they want to do when they blow it? The hundreds of billions he built have raised the valuation of the stock market, which has had an impact on him. It has dropped, but on our side, it has gone up. Of course, this is only an internal look. If we look at a small scale, you may have bought Lao Huang. If you buy Lao Te's stocks or buy something from Lao Te, then you will definitely cry. That's the truth. But if you buy this, you may be happy again, but in the end, Lao Huang will still be happy. In the end, are they one? Taoist priest, in the end, we Let’s analyze it further. I don’t understand their deeper gameplay, but let’s think about it. You want to use someone else’s graphics card, someone else’s computing power, and someone else’s underlying code that is open sourced from outside. Oh, how can this be possible? Just say that it is better than others. Of course, it is possible to surpass others in a certain point or to have some innovations in it, but it will definitely not be as good as what everyone said. This is for sure, because you have made everything based on open source. This open source thing may be confusing in some parts, but if we think about it with our toes, we will know the trick behind it, so let’s not talk about it for now. Seek said that he plagiarized, that he stole data, that he used their original big model and then added smaller models, etc. He still said that the teacher was unprofessional and didn’t understand. In short, he was sure there was innovation, but not that much. But the reason why it is so big this time may be because What? He speculated it himself. Our ds company speculated it himself. He wanted to make it more popular. Of course, it may have been over-speculated or over-specified. He used this matter to do event marketing, but in turn, he was criticized by the West. They caught it and they used it to do some event marketing You see, so different things are so interesting. So if you simply ask Taoist friends about one thing, it is difficult for Taoist priests to sort it out. So Taoist priests, the main point today is just to test whether the background can be approved. Bazi doesn’t care about those 4 dimensions, 5 dimensions, and 8 dimensions, but Dao Changgang I just checked and found out that they have already started sanctioning this. Of course, this is also their usual method, which is to make you nervous, make you sneaky, make you deny what you ask for, and then let you buy it at a high price on the black market. His things are what this old Huang is talking about. A common gameplay with some of them is Nvidia Lao Huang. Because of this in-depth search, his stock market dropped hundreds of billions of dollars. This is indeed a bit unfair. Liang Wenfeng is indeed a bit unfair. Of course, if you look behind the scenes, It can also be seen that the horoscope of Lao Huang that Taoist Master shared a few days ago was created by him. What determines his own destiny is that the year of Chen itself is a difficult hurdle for him. No matter how much he blusters, he doesn't know how to pay attention. Then if this thing is pulled so high by him, it will inevitably bubble up in a certain month of a certain year. This is what Chen immediately looked at. The year is almost over, and he didn’t take too many chances. Although he was fined once by us a few days ago, he was punished by us. It's not painful for him to warn him once. It seems that there are still 6 days left. In the fifth or sixth day of Yi Si New Year, his good luck has come again, and he has been given a slap in the past few days, so this is also him. To put it bluntly, he was able to get it right according to the horoscope chart that the Taoist priest drew last time, Lao Huang. Of course, the Taoist priest is still Looking at the higher-ups, this is just an illusion, or you can’t say that this is a complete bad thing for Lao Huang. Without these highs and lows, naturally they wouldn’t be fun. You really think they are all making products. In the end, no company that is large enough to make products must have high and low requirements. You have to have in and out, you have to cry and laugh. This is the ultimate way to play capital. It’s better not to go too far. There are many professional videos and professional articles on the Internet. I won’t share the professional knowledge, but I will briefly mention a few sentences. The founder of Deep Exploration is Liang Wenfeng. Some people say that this person is very powerful and very good. People say this is a new model of capital, but Taoist priest took a look and did some homework. Indeed, he is also a capital player. What I am best at is capital layout. Liang Wenfeng is particularly good at capital layout and asset management. It is also hundreds of billions in private equity. Fund managers were also the first to use algorithms in securities, stock markets, etc. He is good at algorithms and is very good at competing with Zhang Yiming. Some people say that he is Pin Xixi in that field. It is said that he has thousands of NVIDIA graphics cards in his hand, but it has not been made clear whether he used NVIDIA this time. Experts outside have analyzed it. We cannot rule out the possibility of speculation and the possibility of harvesting in the next step because NVIDIA has now harvested giants such as Musk, Apple, and Microsoft. However, retail industry customers and individual customers have not formed a harvesting force, and the reputation of the previous period (yellow) has completely stinked with our relationship, etc. As a result, this person has fewer users, and this time he explored in depth. Seek is possible. To complete this deep harvest, just look at Liang Wen. Feng ’s experience is that he is good at capital operations, operations and harvesting of private equity funds, and he just won the Golden Bull Award, the highest honor in the private equity industry a few years ago. The company’s mission is also to improve the effectiveness of the secondary market in China, but the Taoist priests in their circle don’t understand. A few years ago, his fund, whose income was not easy to manage from 100 billion, has become 60 billion. 50 billion and now it seems to have become 30 billion. Later, he started to change his career and changed it to the field of intelligent AI. So this time, especially in the west, many people questioned that this was a new capital hype. Some of them even said that this is Borrowing corpses and resurrecting souls is borrowing money and using some of their technologies. Of course, this has also been refuted. They said that I They are all open source. You can research it as you like. If you have the ability, you can also open source it. Of course, this is just them. Of course, there are all kinds of voices. The Taoist priest just said to read different voices. The Taoist priest is not professional and cannot research what that thing is. Is it okay to test the 8-character batch? The Taoist priest is qualified and capable to evaluate it, but in the final analysis, people say What is the core computer room used, what is the core computing power, and what is the architecture of this thing? Is it the same as their plagiarized Taoist priest? It is true that he does not have the ability to evaluate, but Liang Wenfeng is particularly good at using intelligent AI for capital operations. This is Sure, so Xi Mian asked him about someone like you who is particularly good at working capital or Why would such a team open source such an intelligent AI? In this age where everything is about money, don’t tell us that you are benefiting mankind for free. The Taoist priest is also doubtful about their doubts. He can only say I have doubts. The Taoist priest doesn’t know the purpose behind it, or whether he also wants me to open a source drum in the end. If you want to tinker with something, don't you have to buy some graphics card and tinker with it? This is how Lao Huang plays. Of course, the Taoist priest has not checked whether there is any kind of relationship between them and Lao Huang. Later, if you have any news about this or Of course, if you can find their horoscope, you can also think about it. This is another topic, but when fellow Taoist repeatedly urged Before the software was released, the Taoist priest just received this push saying that this old American had launched a security investigation on deepseek and said it was theft. Some of their scientific research results are even more interesting, they say. Finally, the funds behind our smart AI and the support of state-owned capital even say that there is an indescribable force. This force that we dare not read or dare to say is supporting this possibility. It is a bit too much. Did we release it deliberately? Limelight, because we can only say that we have some unshakable, unshakable, indescribable strength to support us. Then you just buy me and it will always rise. Is there such a thing? The Taoist priest didn’t check it. Of course, that’s what the outside world says. The outside world says that because you have the support of indescribable power, then we have to check you and check whether you have it. So, This should be it. They should give a result when checking, but of course there may not be a result. And there is him. Of course, the West has opinions on open source, but he only has opinions, and he has not recruited anyone. Because open source is not only open to the East, there are also some companies and teams that specialize in open source. They are always open source and closed source. These are indeed two directions. Ideas and even two beliefs. Some people in the West even say that this is communism versus capitalism. The level of resistance is a bit high. Oh, they may not understand what our area is like, but they don’t dare to go too far in this area. I believe it may not have reached this level. Indeed, it has not reached this level. It’s not because we are trying to achieve better things. In order to achieve common prosperity for everyone, in order to achieve better communism, we will develop this smart AI There is no such possibility. They may have some idea of ​​what it is called. In short, it is a bit fussy and made a fuss. How do you say this? Let’s not expand too much on this matter at the moment because the Taoist priest may also address this matter in the future. I will post a dedicated sharing section when I publish one. The main point is to say that the results of today’s test are quite interesting. Although this is not It's as exaggerated as that Taoist friend said, but the speed of his development is beyond what the Taoist leader thought. To put it bluntly, it is still the framework or the entire module. If it is really There is an opportunity for him to conduct a large amount of data accumulation with a real case, maybe ah, maybe there is Of course, the most difficult thing in this regard is Yi Xue. The Taoist priest shared before why he said that there are some things that cannot be quantified, cannot be figured out, and cannot be digitized. This can be done by relying on the ability of sensory perception. This may be intelligent AI, let alone never reach it. Arrival means that it may be a realm that can only be reached by the last level, so in that case This intelligent AI is currently used in various industries. The feeling of the real Taoist priest should be that it is indeed better than the intelligent AI sent by the Taoist friends who have been tested by the Taoist priest before. His human-based approach is very close to ours. This kind of thinking mode and then the solution is indeed very similar step by step and is not given to you in a single way. This is definitely not a result collected or found online. This is already close to what we want. Or if the director opens something, he feels that this is indeed close to what we want. It's still right, but Taoist priest still says that technology is a double-edged sword, and artificial intelligence is even more so. The double-edged sword can indeed benefit mankind and improve production efficiency, but it can also become an accomplice of capitalists in harvesting. This is for sure. You can make money without doing evil. This is the bottom line that the Taoist priest has always emphasized. Whether this is a god or a demon, you will have to wait and see. I believe you will know soon. It was already very late at night today, Taoist priest. This is because he went to bed so late the first day. 10 horoscopes. I tested them. I fell asleep a little late. Today’s sharing is a little short. I’ll add a few more words. I’ll add a few more words. I tested it quite late last night and I felt a little dizzy. Another one seems like it seems that the Taoist priest’s mentality was bad during the test. It seems that I was just trying to find something wrong. I tested a few more horoscopes this morning because the point of my question was about the DS function. You can't criticize the horoscopes. I asked the Taoist priest about this aspect of the test. In the end, it turned out that the core content of Yunjie Laozhuang's side is a bit biased. Let me add a few words. First of all, use this, it's called software, it's also called a platform, it's also called intelligence. Let's use this robot to measure horoscopes. First, the Taoist priest will talk about the advantages and disadvantages separately. What is the first advantage? He has a reasoning mind. This test process is not available in all smart AI platforms or other software at present. It is still helpful to us. He doesn’t mean to be confused. He doesn’t mean to say that I will give you a result. I will give you the reasoning process. For example, if you provide a person, his process is very close to the Taoist priest’s thinking process. He will tell you first. This horoscope is because first of all, men and women are different. Secondly, it tells you where you were born, and then whether it takes into account your daylight saving time. If it is daylight saving time, he will subtract this time for you, and he will also remind you whether you are doing this. Daylight saving time has been taken into account, etc. This is a bit like a real person's thinking process rather than clicking. It just throws you a time that is either daylight saving time or not, and it also tells you the result. If it is daylight saving time, then it is like this. If it is not daylight saving time, then you may have to correct your time column. So, He was very humane in this regard. Later he also mentioned that in the real sun, there were many friends who had a lot of softness. For example, if you ask your wife, he will obviously give you a wrong result. He will not consider it at all, and he will not mention it, but he will mention this software. At this point, he is already very powerful, because of this transfer. The director of the library is still saying that he doesn’t know which library he transferred. That’s good enough because there are 10 softwares on the Internet with 9 errors. Which one did he transfer? This is at least close to the Taoist priest's manual arrangement, or close to the online ones. For example, let alone the ones we commonly use. It may be suspected of advertising. It's the one commonly used by everyone. Wait, it's close to correct. This at least fundamentally reduces the errors caused by our layout or software errors. Secondly, he also reminds you that this may be wrong, and you have to review it yourself, otherwise he will not be responsible for the result. To put it bluntly, it is like chatting with someone and saying that you have to tell me your accurate birthplace and accurate time of birth, and then you still It's daylight saving time. If you don't know, just ask your parents. That's roughly what it means. Instead of bringing it over directly, just bring over the card. Your card may be wrong. Furthermore, he will take this into consideration when arranging the board. Solar terms, for example, you are not simply silent I think that when you are born according to the lunar calendar and the solar calendar, this is the first month, which is the Yin month, which is the Mao month. When is the solar term? Of course, it is also extracted from the database, but this is already very good. He will tell you that May is Starting from the day of the day, remember the day and so on. To put it bluntly, this is a thinking process. Normal arrangement will also consider this instead of blindly telling you what month you think Yin month is, Mao month is what month, and Wu month is what month. Is n't that right? Let you know in detail. The reason why this part is called thinking and reasoning process is normal and should not be reflected in the horoscope. It is like saying that the result of your horoscope is like a machine or a machine manual, but you cannot put this machine You can also post the manufacturing instructions or the source code of the website. This is roughly the same principle, so this is called the thinking process, and this thinking process is very important for us to understand a horoscope or how to derive this. The horoscope is very important. This is also a function that modern friends want. It means that I want to know what is going on and why. You don’t want to tell me. I like wood fire. I am also deceived. I like wood fire. But I want to know. Why does he like wood fire? Let me tell you that Ding Huo was born in the winter when the body was weak, and then he was born in the month of Renzi. Then after you were weak, the official kill became strong, which made you weak, and then there was no wood in your horoscope, etc. , so it is very interesting to say this. Yes, but the Taoist priest still said it anyway. The Taoist priest was talking about his recommendation. The processing process is very fun and humane, but perhaps because of the amount of information stored in the 8-word database or because of some non-process-based or humanistic things, he is not sure about the result. The probability of his being wrong is still very high. It's big, but it 's already good. It's really good. Is this true? Let's talk about it separately. He's already very anthropomorphic in terms of process and reasoning process. This is close to not thinking like a machine, but really like a person thinking. This is one of the first advantages. The second advantage is templating. This templating is definitely more sophisticated than what Dao Zhang does. In fact, Dao Zhang already has I think the Taoist priest is very precise. Ordinary teachers will just post your horoscopes. They won’t care whether you are right or wrong, and they will push it until the last horoscope is wrong. Then everything is wrong. This kind of contact with the Taoist priest is too much. There are too many, so the Taoist priest has tried to template all the preliminary work, that is, to ask you to provide yours. Just now, this is the set of things that this intelligent AI wants. The Taoist priest has asked you to submit everything he said, so he still has this point. It’s good to say that many of his early stages are easy. Easy is composed of difficult to easy. He extracted all the difficult parts of you and tried to make it form a template. The things you need in the early stage and the results of the later approval. The result of the approval is definitely. For example, if you want to approve a horoscope, naturally you want to approve it in detail. Then tell it after the approval. What are the pattern characteristics of your horoscope, likes and dislikes, and then you are approved. For example, in terms of career, wealth, marriage, relationship, physical health, etc. , and finally the Grand Luck and New Year, the whole thing should have a set of templates. However, if some careful people always use this set of templates, If you take it seriously, he will form a template for you. If you click on this template, you will fill in the blanks. The general direction is at least not bad, but some are not detailed. Because most teachers ignore this aspect, he will write according to his feelings and tell you to focus on it. He just comes according to his feelings. There may be more on this side and less on that side, but sometimes some things may be left behind. If you consider this from the perspective of intelligent AI, he is better than humans. He is not No matter which area you focus on or not, all the areas must be at least listed. In fact, it will become a bit like that. If a teacher criticizes it, it will be like setting and answering questions by yourself, so you may not necessarily have missed anything. But if it is As for software, what is it? You just fill in the blanks. Even in the end, you can judge the question and tell me whether I am right or wrong. You can just pick out the mistakes and correct my mistakes. Of course there are. It's all wrong from the root, so it's very difficult to change it. But after all, some of it is still right. So purely from the perspective of its process and templates, the level of intelligent AI is much higher than our artificial intelligence. Daochang's even includes many other online software. It is certain that the results given by this intelligent AI are exactly the same as what you asked Du Niang about. What are your preferences and taboos under the software and the results? It's completely different. It 's really different. That one has no reference. So from this point of view, its templating is pretty good. What's the good thing about this smart AI? It's progressive. Just like Taoist priest this morning. The test also specifically corrected a few things. For example, if the Taoist priest he gave this result was wrong, he could directly say that you are wrong based on his results. Just click here to see it like chatting. You are strong, weak, or something. After you provided it, he still responded to you and repeatedly communicated with you to discuss it. Finally, he also admitted his mistake and started to have a stubborn attitude. He was stubborn about his own mistakes and his own rights. Yi Li may have found him online, but the Taoist priest still After insisting on the Taoist priest's point of view, he will really think about it, but he will say that based on you, I thought about it again, especially from the true to the false. The Taoist priest posted a case that may be related to making money. He refused to follow it at first, but later passed After being repeatedly induced by the Taoist priest, he also said that this might be a fake follower. Afterwards, I corrected my preferences and taboos. But this is not that simple. After repeated induction by the Taoist priest, he gave a new result according to the Taoist priest's intention and said that in this regard, he is very human. It’s not like a machine that coldly says I’m right or wrong, but what? What is a human being? At first, he thought it was right. But after repeated communication with a person who was smarter than him, he probably thought that this was what you said, and he changed his initial idea. And this intelligent AI has indeed achieved this. Of course, this is his good Taoist priest, but it’s ridiculous to think of it again This may be his shortcoming. If there are some uneducated people or people who are not good at criticizing Bazis to specifically guide him, then this result may be criticized according to the wrong result in the future. This is the reason. In other words, for example, this horoscope is clearly Taoist priest Ximuhuo also sees Ximuhuo, but many beginners think he likes gold water, and then come up to correct him and say, you are wrong, I tell you, Xiao I said you are wrong, you are Xijinshui, you are. Xijinshui can be said by one person but it can be said by two people, but when there are countless people saying it He will correct this result and say that this result of Xijinshui is correct. This is the current intelligent AI. So you can understand that he is very intelligent and you can also understand that he is mentally retarded. So in his early stage, if there is someone who is particularly easy to learn. You can say that you just need to teach him and let him do well. As he grows up, he may benefit people in the future. If someone deliberately teases him to trick him, then he may trick people in the future. But at least this thing has a decent appearance and is fun. Will Taoist priest continue to talk about his advantages? Just talk about him. The advantage is that those things that are fixed are not as easy as what I just said. The hard part in making it simple can basically not make mistakes. I can only say that it is basically basic. Of course, for example, there are some input errors and some of the original data provided are wrong, so there may be errors. Let’s talk about the hard part. It basically can’t make mistakes. Simple. This part is indeed very easy for you. Normally, it would take ten and a half months to approve a horoscope, which is a detailed approval of the fortune teller, or even longer. In ancient times, the gentleman would move his luggage and live in a wealthy family's house for three months. He was very slow. Why was he so slow? His brain is running slowly. He is organizing this thing in the early stage to expel this thing from you. But It takes a few days to arrange a disk. After repeated corrections, it is possible that Mr. drank some wine that day and wrote the disk incorrectly, etc. But there is no such possibility in intelligent AI, so it is said that he does not have one that appears in person. The mistakes are all ours. It is impossible for him to calculate and add 1+1 for you. It is absolutely impossible to make it into 3, so there is absolutely no problem in handing over the difficult and simple parts to the intelligent AI. However, because easy is composed of difficult to easy and simple, it is difficult for him to master this mutated part, especially if the Taoist priest repeats it. The emphasis on the movement of the six lines and eight characters Anger is definitely volatile, especially this kind of intelligent AI. If he meets a woman with the kind of emotions that the Taoist priest shared before, he won't know what to ask. If he throws his pile of things up and throws them to the AI. The AI ​​will definitely mislead him because he doesn’t know what he wants to ask in the early stage. This is the truth. If you really want to communicate with intelligent AI, you have to use one of its languages ​​or extract those difficult and simple things to it appropriately, and then add the appropriate changes yourself. How can you understand it yourself so that you can get one? The desired result was carried out according to the Taoist leader's test. It was a preliminary test and there will be more tests in the next few years. At least for now, the next conclusion is that he still cannot master this Qi. This Qi is indeed very good for the Bazi. It's important. The horoscope is between yin and yang, between heaven, earth, man, heaven and earth. What else is there between Yi and Dao? After all, the mystery between Yi and Dao is called Xuan. But it is indeed enough to template, process and think about the difficult and simple parts. So the level of his intelligent AI is already It is no longer a simple concept as we understand it. Check out the concept. It does have a bit of intelligence. This is the advantage that Taoist priest mentioned earlier. One of the advantages of this child. Of course, what everyone advocates for any intelligent AI is its learning ability, and this learning Ability cannot be measured in the short term. This requires feeding a large amount of data. Even if it is a very heavy job, you have to keep throwing it to him, and then you have to be able to know what is right and wrong, and after a period of time, you can see the same throw again. data or access The results he gave are close to the same data. You can see if he has improved. This is more tiring. Maybe next year, if he has time, the Taoist priest will push a version of this. It depends on whether he has this aspect. This is an improvement. This is very important for a smart AI. Don't throw it up. If it has been like this for many years, then it is not called smart AI. What they advocate the most about smart AI is that it has a learning ability close to that of our humans, just like a child. you teach him He will know it if you teach him, and he will take the initiative to learn. If you disconnect the Internet, he is actually running continuously in the background. He is analyzing, comparing, and thinking. He is thinking about why one of those horoscopes is mentioned. Why does this Congge say that the Xiji that his machine thinks is Ximuhuo has to tell Xijinshui that it can be called a real bit of intelligence? Then he is awesome and he says it’s okay. Put it aside and think about it. Next time you ask the same question, he will give you a new answer. If this is possible, then this is the singularity they call it. If this can really be achieved, then he may be away from the Bazi. Almost, of course, he must be dead now. As a Taoist priest, I really feel that he has mastery of the relationship between life and restraint in the five elements. It's pretty good because the Five Elements are still controlled by Taoist priests, so it's easy to understand the underlying intelligent AI, but it's still the Ten Gods, so he can't master it. It's not even mentioned here, that is, it's not reflected in the batch. If you don’t have the Ten Gods, this is what the Taoist priest shared a few days ago. Because the Ten Gods are alive, the Ten Gods can confuse the smart AI and completely mess it up. It collapsed, so he didn’t reflect any of the ten gods in it. What he embodied was the restrained relationship between the five elements, and then he derived an 8-character result based on this. So based on this, he was actually wrong. The probability will be lower if you press Ten Gods, it is possible that he will not be able to push it accurately, so sometimes you can only rely on us to truly approve or negotiate with Ten Gods. So based on this, if you let this kind of intelligent AI estimate whether this person likes the same sex or the opposite sex, as we said a few days ago, does he like his father, his younger brother, or something like an Oedipus complex? He can't judge this horoscope, or he can't master this intelligent AI. That may be It is really a living thing. Whether he can control it in the future, at least he can't control it now, and he has not reflected any information in this area. Of course, there is also a possibility that he is considering the acceptance of certain people or certain laws and regulations. This is not impossible according to the provisions, so it may be that the Taoist priest is superficial. Then the Taoist priest will talk about his current shortcomings. Or as a disadvantage, let’s say that the first one is not human enough or anthropomorphic enough. Maybe, maybe the amount of data he reserves is to train a large model. The amount of food he feeds to him based on the results of the horoscope is not enough. So naturally, it means you are a child. Even if you are smart and have an IQ of 180, you have never been given a question and you have no idea how to do it so well. In the end, he may still not be able to come out with this result, because just take the Taoist priest as an example, or the Taoist priest comes into contact with some teachers as an example. The reason why he is doing well in the evaluation now is not because he has experienced countless horoscopes. These horoscopes have been subtly and deeply ingrained. Once it's stuck in his head, he'll know the same thing when communicating with others. This is indeed not a saying. Teach you how to recognize this horoscope and how to correct it and he will be able to come out. He also gave the Taoist priest as an example and said that he has never been in contact with so many business people or he has no experience in business. Then this person will ask about his current career problems. You can’t give him a perfect solution to his confusion. Answer: In fact, it is like intelligent AI. What it accumulates is data accumulation. The number of cases is not enough. It means the same thing. It means that it only understands this horoscope, but it has not experienced it specifically. Not to mention that it has been experienced. You must at least have looked at it. So if you look at it from this aspect, intelligent AI More of them may improve your ability in this area. So if you ask it to simply analyze the five elements, likes and dislikes of your horoscope or the general level of your life based on this intelligent AI platform, it should be possible. But if he Like the Taoist priest said you can provide 10 essence Accurate questions, and the information reflected in the 8 characters will give you an accurate answer to these 10 questions. Even the smart AI cannot do it. It may even give you a negative answer. That is very possible. That actually means you have mastered the Bazi batch On the basis of complex results, combined with his good luck and his current experiences or past experiences with himself, you can then give him a humanized result, which is very important for intelligence. It is indeed relatively difficult for AI, and there is another way What I have been thinking about for a long time is that a Taoist priest of intelligent AI is not sure. This may belong to a deeper aspect of data and security between them. I just say that there is a paradox in it. What else is it called? In short, what does it mean? If you don’t If you give smart AI a case, it won't be able to grow, but now Because he has not grown up, his judgment is wrong, and you cannot give him a real case. This is why you cannot really ask him to criticize his horoscopes. Then he will never be able to grow up. After all, it is difficult for him to say this, he and our master It’s different. Of course, masters also have this truth. The older the master is, the more valuable he is. The new student of Yi is that if you are in your 20s and you say you have learned everything, others may not believe you. This is the truth. So this is for smart people. For AI, it may be a difficult hurdle for him to overcome, so Taoist priest doesn’t even know where the data he found online came from or where the model he learned came from. Of course, this early stage was shared in the middle of the night last night. The external reviewers are also reviewing here to ask them to explain their data clearly. Which piece of data did you refer to and study to give this result? Did you refer to several of their big data and that big model? Of course they asked It's quite shameful. The Taoist priest has shared it before. Where did their data come from? They said that your data was stolen from us. Are we just shaking our heads and wagging our butts? Our daily habits, etc. , etc. were all corrected by them. Now they say this, do n’t talk about this. At present, the Taoist priest tested this today and learned from them. Of course, this is another matter, Taoist priest. Talking and running, the Taoist priest is also thinking about this matter. Let me tell you where the data comes from because it actually belongs to an intranet or a closed network. In other words, if you ask, the 8-character Taoist priest will give it to you. Approval completed This result is only for you, and no one is allowed to grab it. Although we use WeChat to transmit, if WeChat leaks your information during the transmission, it will be illegal. So, is there any legal provision for intelligent AI? If there is no restraint now, there will be one in the future. If you don’t restrain him, it won’t be finished. But after restraint, should you let him use this thing for training, right? Then I will transmit it through your intelligent AI. If you lose or you are approved but you are not allowed to use this as training, right? Then why do you use what I have learned in this life to train? The Taoist priest has accumulated the approval in his head, so he has no way to save it for you. I have it in my head, but is this also true for smart AI? Or how does smart AI distinguish what is private content and what is non-private content? This may be really difficult for smart AI. For example, the Taoist priest also gave an example. If the Taoist encounters the same horoscope, the result will be completely different. This is for sure. But if the intelligent AI encounters a horoscope you approved or a horoscope you provided, it will give such a horoscope result to the next person and ask him the same horoscope. If someone gives it to someone, it must be wrong. There must be something in it that needs to be corrected. Let’s not talk about whether the content is right or wrong. Give him your results. Whether it is allowed or not, there will be some regulations in the law in the future, so this is also what the Taoist will consider whether he will be in this field in the future. Of course, the Taoist will consider this, which may not only be for our Yixue area, but also exist for other industries. How to divide things between data and AI is a problem, so this may also restrict the use of intelligent AI in at least other fields. The development of the field of numerology is a very important thing. Everything we ask is basically private content. It is not private and it is impossible for people to ask privately. But your private content is directly stored in your database by AI. Is it possible that when others retrieve it in the future, this part of the privacy will be retrieved? Will this cause any harm to the person who provided it? The director at least made it clear when he submitted the information whether he agreed with the numerology sharing. If he disagreed thoroughly, he would not share it. But does the intelligent AI have this mechanism? Or does it include the Taoist priest who submitted it when the Taoist chief was testing him now? It’s hard to say whether the content will be used the next time someone else tests it. It’s hard to say based on the current Taoist review of him. Analysis should be that he can use it, otherwise how will he grow? Or if he doesn't use it at all, then what are the results of Dao Zhang's current search based on, right? Or is it based on what kind of data he has mobilized in the early stage? But Dao Zhang It's just the first test now. So whose data did he mobilize in the early stage? So this is a problem. Let's not think about it too much. Another consideration is how long can this kind of open source and this so-called free form be used? It won't be like what you did in the past few years or something like that, coaxing everyone to come and play for a few days. It is also possible that pinching the neck can deceive people, or it is a shortcoming of this form. Because the test time of the Taoist leader is short, I don’t know what he is like now. A model or in this case may also make intelligent AI popularize or create a problem for our users. Of course, some people say that after you use it, you have to charge people and you have to pay. That’s the way to go. Or whether it is this kind of smart person or other normal paid Taoist priests, they always support it. If the Taoist priest does not support it, they will use a method or something to encircle everyone. After you join the circle and then start to cut it, people don't welcome it. But you have provided services to everyone. After all, you have to buy a graphics card to run it. You also have to buy a server. You have to buy space. You have to buy something. Then you charge this The service fee is normal. The Taoist priest has always said that it is normal. He has said it again and again, but the Taoist priest should just say it, purely from his ability to appraise the horoscopes. The Taoist priest is giving me the one I gave yesterday. I want to give it 5 points. If 10 points are full, I took another test this morning and decided to give him 6 points. I said that at least General Baba passed. This is the only time the Taoist priest saw a passing grade and said this. It's already pretty good, so I'd better give him some encouragement, Taoist priest. After all, all intelligent AIs are children. To what extent they can grow in the future depends on our guidance or how you teach them. The Taoist priest thinks that it can still be used in good ways. I can only say that it can be taught. So I just thought of these few words and added a little more. It’s been half an hour to add. If I use it completely during the test or after a while, if I think of anything, I can add it somewhere. That’s it first and then. Fellow Taoists, what are you using in the process of using it, or you are batching the horoscopes for the smart ai? Do you have any thoughts or suggestions on this? Or where do you think this problem lies? Just like those Taoist friends sent private messages to the Taoist Master and said that you can leave a message under the audio so that the Taoist Master will give a unified reply in the future and everyone can communicate together. Let’s take a look at the future of smart AI being used in Yi Xue. Let’s also study it.
