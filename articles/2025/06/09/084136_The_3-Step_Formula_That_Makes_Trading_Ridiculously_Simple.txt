好的，以下是根据提供的文本生成的摘要和概念图：

**摘要：**

本文的核心观点是，交易不必复杂，其本质在于理解和跟随市场的“流”。就像一条河流，交易者的目标是找到最强的流并顺势而为。

为了识别这种市场“流”，需要结合三个关键要素：

1.  **趋势 (Trend):** 市场的方向。这可以通过比较短期和长期移动平均线来判断（例如，短期均线在长期均线之上表示上升趋势，反之表示下降趋势）。趋势如同交易的指南针。
2.  **动量 (Momentum):** 市场运动的持续性。动量反映了人群的购买或抛售力量，就像一个正在获胜的团队会持续获胜。在图表上，这通常通过特定的点状指标来表示（例如，绿色点表示买入动量，红色点表示卖出动量）。顺应动量至关重要，不要试图逆势操作。
3.  **斜率 (Slope):** 价格变化的速度和强度，也是趋势持续性的确认。在上升趋势中，积极的斜率表现为价格不断创出更高的高点；在下降趋势中，消极的斜率表现为价格不断创出更低的低点。斜率确认了趋势和动量的力量。

这三个要素需要协同作用。单独依靠趋势或动量可能不足以预测持续性，因为它们可能出现虚假信号或短暂波动。只有当趋势指明方向、动量显示力量、且斜率确认价格正朝着有利方向持续移动时，才形成了高概率的交易机会。这就像一个完美的派对：首先得有派对（趋势），大家玩得开心（动量），而且派对越来越热闹（斜率）。

在实际应用中，需要在图表上耐心等待这三个条件的汇合。虽然并非所有遵循此策略的交易都会成功，但长期来看，这种方法能够显著提高交易的胜率。建议初学者从简单入手，先在图表上观察和练习这些信号的出现。

**核心结论：**

当趋势、动量和斜率三个要素同向汇合时，交易机会最优。

**总体框架：**

“顺势而为”的交易框架，通过分析趋势、动量和斜率三个关键要素来识别高概率交易机会。

In this video, I'm going to show you three simple steps to going to show you three simple steps to going to show you three simple steps to making sure that you're always in sync making sure that you're always in sync making sure that you're always in sync with the crowd and always on the right with the crowd and always on the right with the crowd and always on the right side of the trade. I'm Boris Slasber. side of the trade. I'm Boris Slasber. side of the trade. I'm Boris Slasber. Let's get into it. The easiest and the Let's get into it. The easiest and the Let's get into it. The easiest and the best way to think of the financial best way to think of the financial best way to think of the financial market is like a flowing river. All market is like a flowing river. All market is like a flowing river. All we're trying to do as traders is simply we're trying to do as traders is simply we're trying to do as traders is simply find the flow, find the strongest find the flow, find the strongest find the flow, find the strongest possible flow, and then jump on it to be possible flow, and then jump on it to be possible flow, and then jump on it to be able to be taken to profit. That's all able to be taken to profit. That's all able to be taken to profit. That's all we need to succeed in trading. In order we need to succeed in trading. In order we need to succeed in trading. In order to trade flow, you need three key to trade flow, you need three key to trade flow, you need three key components. You need trend, you need components. You need trend, you need components. You need trend, you need momentum, and you need slope. I'm going momentum, and you need slope. I'm going momentum, and you need slope. I'm going to explain each in great detail to make to explain each in great detail to make to explain each in great detail to make you understand exactly why these are the you understand exactly why these are the you understand exactly why these are the ingredients that make the perfect ingredients that make the perfect ingredients that make the perfect perfect trade. First of all, let's start perfect trade. First of all, let's start perfect trade. First of all, let's start with with with chat. Trend is like a compass. It chat. Trend is like a compass. It chat. Trend is like a compass. It essentially tells you direction and you essentially tells you direction and you essentially tells you direction and you really don't have to over complicate really don't have to over complicate really don't have to over complicate things. Trend can be gauged by two very, things. Trend can be gauged by two very, things. Trend can be gauged by two very, very simple moving averages. All you very simple moving averages. All you very simple moving averages. All you need is a short-term moving average and need is a short-term moving average and need is a short-term moving average and a long-term moving average. As long as a long-term moving average. As long as a long-term moving average. As long as the short-term moving average is above the short-term moving average is above the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, that is the long-term moving average, that is the long-term moving average, that is going to tell you that the trend is up. going to tell you that the trend is up. going to tell you that the trend is up. If the short-term moving average is If the short-term moving average is If the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, the below the long-term moving average, the below the long-term moving average, the trend is down. That's really all you trend is down. That's really all you trend is down. That's really all you need to be able to find and ride need to be able to find and ride need to be able to find and ride direction. But trend by itself is not direction. But trend by itself is not direction. But trend by itself is not enough. enough. enough. The second key ingredient in our formula The second key ingredient in our formula The second key ingredient in our formula is is is momentum. Momentum is simply the very momentum. Momentum is simply the very momentum. Momentum is simply the very very simple Newtonian idea that an very simple Newtonian idea that an very simple Newtonian idea that an object in motion will remain in motion. object in motion will remain in motion. object in motion will remain in motion. Like a winning sports team that is on a Like a winning sports team that is on a Like a winning sports team that is on a great streak, momentum tends to build great streak, momentum tends to build great streak, momentum tends to build momentum. Winning begets winning. Buying momentum. Winning begets winning. Buying momentum. Winning begets winning. Buying begets buying. selling to get selling. begets buying. selling to get selling. begets buying. selling to get selling. If you're on the right side of momentum, If you're on the right side of momentum, If you're on the right side of momentum, you are on the right side of the trade. you are on the right side of the trade. you are on the right side of the trade. That's what's so important. And that's a That's what's so important. And that's a That's what's so important. And that's a key key mistake that many many novice key key mistake that many many novice key key mistake that many many novice traders make. They think that if you go traders make. They think that if you go traders make. They think that if you go the opposite of momentum, you're going the opposite of momentum, you're going the opposite of momentum, you're going to be smart. But most of the time, to be smart. But most of the time, to be smart. But most of the time, you're just going to get bowled over by you're just going to get bowled over by you're just going to get bowled over by the power of the crowd. Our job is not the power of the crowd. Our job is not the power of the crowd. Our job is not to be smarter than the crowd. Our job is to be smarter than the crowd. Our job is to be smarter than the crowd. Our job is to be in sync with it. The final to be in sync with it. The final to be in sync with it. The final component of our formula is slope. Slope component of our formula is slope. Slope component of our formula is slope. Slope is simply the idea of making sure that is simply the idea of making sure that is simply the idea of making sure that the fresh highs you're seeing are higher the fresh highs you're seeing are higher the fresh highs you're seeing are higher than the prior highs or the fresh lows than the prior highs or the fresh lows than the prior highs or the fresh lows that you're seeing are lower than the that you're seeing are lower than the that you're seeing are lower than the prior lows. If you have positive slope, prior lows. If you have positive slope, prior lows. If you have positive slope, that means the instrument you're trading that means the instrument you're trading that means the instrument you're trading is rising. If you have negative slope, is rising. If you have negative slope, is rising. If you have negative slope, that means the instrument you're trading that means the instrument you're trading that means the instrument you're trading is falling. As long as you're on the is falling. As long as you're on the is falling. As long as you're on the right side of that equation, you're right side of that equation, you're right side of that equation, you're going to be in very good hands. Now, why going to be in very good hands. Now, why going to be in very good hands. Now, why do we need all three? The reason why is do we need all three? The reason why is do we need all three? The reason why is because trend by itself is just not because trend by itself is just not because trend by itself is just not enough. It's simply a directional cue, enough. It's simply a directional cue, enough. It's simply a directional cue, but it doesn't really tell you that but it doesn't really tell you that but it doesn't really tell you that there's going to be any chance of there's going to be any chance of there's going to be any chance of continuation. Momentum too by itself can continuation. Momentum too by itself can continuation. Momentum too by itself can be waning simply because sometimes you be waning simply because sometimes you be waning simply because sometimes you get big spikes and sharp drops. So get big spikes and sharp drops. So get big spikes and sharp drops. So momentum really really increases but momentum really really increases but momentum really really increases but then just waines very very quickly. So then just waines very very quickly. So then just waines very very quickly. So you absolutely want to be sure by you absolutely want to be sure by you absolutely want to be sure by bringing in our third component which is bringing in our third component which is bringing in our third component which is slope. And slope of course is only slope. And slope of course is only slope. And slope of course is only possible once you have the first two in possible once you have the first two in possible once you have the first two in place. You have to have trend in place. place. You have to have trend in place. place. You have to have trend in place. You have to have momentum in place. And You have to have momentum in place. And You have to have momentum in place. And only then will slope become visible. And only then will slope become visible. And only then will slope become visible. And once that's visible, then you really, once that's visible, then you really, once that's visible, then you really, really have something unique. You have a really have something unique. You have a really have something unique. You have a great trade setup. And you don't have to great trade setup. And you don't have to great trade setup. And you don't have to do anything else but just simply hit the do anything else but just simply hit the do anything else but just simply hit the buy button or the sell button and go. buy button or the sell button and go. buy button or the sell button and go. Your trade should take care of itself. Your trade should take care of itself. Your trade should take care of itself. Overall, you want to ask yourself the Overall, you want to ask yourself the Overall, you want to ask yourself the following three questions. Question following three questions. Question following three questions. Question number one, is the party happening? Is number one, is the party happening? Is number one, is the party happening? Is there overall market activity? Is there there overall market activity? Is there there overall market activity? Is there a trend in place? Great. a trend in place? Great. a trend in place? Great. Question number two, are people having Question number two, are people having Question number two, are people having fun? Is there a lot of momentum? Is it fun? Is there a lot of momentum? Is it fun? Is there a lot of momentum? Is it moving to fresh highs? The answer is moving to fresh highs? The answer is moving to fresh highs? The answer is yes. Great. And finally, is it getting yes. Great. And finally, is it getting yes. Great. And finally, is it getting better? Is the vibe of the party really better? Is the vibe of the party really better? Is the vibe of the party really really taking off? Are all is everybody really taking off? Are all is everybody really taking off? Are all is everybody dancing and laughing, enjoying dancing and laughing, enjoying dancing and laughing, enjoying themselves? That's positive slope or themselves? That's positive slope or themselves? That's positive slope or negative slope. in a downtrend. You have negative slope. in a downtrend. You have negative slope. in a downtrend. You have those three things. You have nothing those three things. You have nothing those three things. You have nothing else to worry about. You can then feel else to worry about. You can then feel else to worry about. You can then feel confident that you're on the right side confident that you're on the right side confident that you're on the right side of the trade and you're in good hands of the trade and you're in good hands of the trade and you're in good hands for further up or down movement. Now for further up or down movement. Now for further up or down movement. Now that you have the formula in place, it's that you have the formula in place, it's that you have the formula in place, it's most important for you to go nice and most important for you to go nice and most important for you to go nice and slow. You don't need to rush and slow. You don't need to rush and slow. You don't need to rush and instantaneously jump into the market. instantaneously jump into the market. instantaneously jump into the market. Remember, these things set up Remember, these things set up Remember, these things set up sequentially. So, all you need to do is sequentially. So, all you need to do is sequentially. So, all you need to do is start simple, maybe even practice first start simple, maybe even practice first start simple, maybe even practice first on the charts. I'm going to show you on the charts. I'm going to show you on the charts. I'm going to show you right now on the charts exactly how right now on the charts exactly how right now on the charts exactly how these setups take place. But more these setups take place. But more these setups take place. But more importantly, you're going to see that importantly, you're going to see that importantly, you're going to see that these setups happen over and over and these setups happen over and over and these setups happen over and over and over again. So, if you miss one, don't over again. So, if you miss one, don't over again. So, if you miss one, don't worry. The next one is coming in a few worry. The next one is coming in a few worry. The next one is coming in a few minutes. Don't junk, don't rush, take it minutes. Don't junk, don't rush, take it minutes. Don't junk, don't rush, take it easy, but follow these three steps. easy, but follow these three steps. easy, but follow these three steps. Let's take a look at the charts and see Let's take a look at the charts and see Let's take a look at the charts and see exactly how they set up for winning exactly how they set up for winning exactly how they set up for winning trades. So now let's go to the actual trades. So now let's go to the actual trades. So now let's go to the actual markets. Let's talk about how this three markets. Let's talk about how this three markets. Let's talk about how this three component confirmation strategy works in component confirmation strategy works in component confirmation strategy works in real markets. We'll take a look first at real markets. We'll take a look first at real markets. We'll take a look first at the S&amp; P futures, the ES contract using the S&amp; P futures, the ES contract using the S&amp; P futures, the ES contract using my proprietary BFF multistrategy my proprietary BFF multistrategy my proprietary BFF multistrategy indicator, which is available to every indicator, which is available to every indicator, which is available to every single BK member. I'll put a link in the single BK member. I'll put a link in the single BK member. I'll put a link in the description below if you want to join description below if you want to join description below if you want to join us. uh and you will be able to get us. uh and you will be able to get us. uh and you will be able to get access to this. It's available both on access to this. It's available both on access to this. It's available both on Trading View and Wealth Charts. So, you Trading View and Wealth Charts. So, you Trading View and Wealth Charts. So, you can be able to measure and control all can be able to measure and control all can be able to measure and control all of your trades by using this indicator. of your trades by using this indicator. of your trades by using this indicator. There's many, many other strategies There's many, many other strategies There's many, many other strategies within this indicator. And part of your within this indicator. And part of your within this indicator. And part of your membership is going to disclose to you membership is going to disclose to you membership is going to disclose to you all the other strategies buried inside all the other strategies buried inside all the other strategies buried inside of this, but we're going to right now of this, but we're going to right now of this, but we're going to right now use the simplest, easiest three use the simplest, easiest three use the simplest, easiest three component strategy to show you exactly component strategy to show you exactly component strategy to show you exactly what I mean. So, first order of what I mean. So, first order of what I mean. So, first order of business, we need trend. Correct? business, we need trend. Correct? business, we need trend. Correct? Therefore, we're looking for short-term Therefore, we're looking for short-term Therefore, we're looking for short-term trend over long-term trend. In this trend over long-term trend. In this trend over long-term trend. In this particular case, my default values are particular case, my default values are particular case, my default values are the 200 period SMA and the 8 period SMA. the 200 period SMA and the 8 period SMA. the 200 period SMA and the 8 period SMA. The red line here is 200 period. The The red line here is 200 period. The The red line here is 200 period. The blue line here is the 8 period. You blue line here is the 8 period. You blue line here is the 8 period. You don't need anything more complex. And don't need anything more complex. And don't need anything more complex. And it's not like these are magical numbers. it's not like these are magical numbers. it's not like these are magical numbers. They're simply representations of They're simply representations of They're simply representations of short-term versus long-term moving short-term versus long-term moving short-term versus long-term moving averages. If you want to use other averages. If you want to use other averages. If you want to use other values, you certainly can. But it really values, you certainly can. But it really values, you certainly can. But it really doesn't matter because the critical doesn't matter because the critical doesn't matter because the critical think here is, as I said, you need a think here is, as I said, you need a think here is, as I said, you need a general compass. And a general compass general compass. And a general compass general compass. And a general compass in this case is that we have a trend up. in this case is that we have a trend up. in this case is that we have a trend up. As blue goes above red, that's proper As blue goes above red, that's proper As blue goes above red, that's proper uptrend condition. Right? So that's uptrend condition. Right? So that's uptrend condition. Right? So that's condition number one. Now, condition condition number one. Now, condition condition number one. Now, condition number two is momentum. And momentum is number two is momentum. And momentum is number two is momentum. And momentum is in this case actualized or uh shown by in this case actualized or uh shown by in this case actualized or uh shown by the dots. Red dots are selling momentum the dots. Red dots are selling momentum the dots. Red dots are selling momentum and green dots are buying momentum. And and green dots are buying momentum. And and green dots are buying momentum. And clearly in an uptrend we're looking for clearly in an uptrend we're looking for clearly in an uptrend we're looking for green dots. We're looking for upside green dots. We're looking for upside green dots. We're looking for upside momentum. So do we have the component momentum. So do we have the component momentum. So do we have the component number two momentum? Yes, we do. Here's number two momentum? Yes, we do. Here's number two momentum? Yes, we do. Here's a green dot. Right? So we have trend and a green dot. Right? So we have trend and a green dot. Right? So we have trend and then we have momentum. And now we have then we have momentum. And now we have then we have momentum. And now we have the last and final piece of this puzzle, the last and final piece of this puzzle, the last and final piece of this puzzle, which is slope. Slope is simply a fancy which is slope. Slope is simply a fancy which is slope. Slope is simply a fancy mathematical way of saying you're going mathematical way of saying you're going mathematical way of saying you're going to have a higher high on the greens, a to have a higher high on the greens, a to have a higher high on the greens, a lower low on the reds. Do we have slope? lower low on the reds. Do we have slope? lower low on the reds. Do we have slope? Indeed, we do. Because you have this Indeed, we do. Because you have this Indeed, we do. Because you have this green over here, and this is a higher green over here, and this is a higher green over here, and this is a higher green over here. And if you just weren't green over here. And if you just weren't green over here. And if you just weren't so sure, let's say you just wanted to be so sure, let's say you just wanted to be so sure, let's say you just wanted to be 100% sure that slope was positive, you 100% sure that slope was positive, you 100% sure that slope was positive, you could wait a little bit longer and look could wait a little bit longer and look could wait a little bit longer and look at this one. And now you have two at this one. And now you have two at this one. And now you have two consecutive green dots, one higher than consecutive green dots, one higher than consecutive green dots, one higher than the next, confirming all three the next, confirming all three the next, confirming all three components, trend, momentum, and slope. components, trend, momentum, and slope. components, trend, momentum, and slope. You go long on this candle over here, You go long on this candle over here, You go long on this candle over here, and of course, you know, it it and of course, you know, it it and of course, you know, it it skyrockets higher. It depends how you skyrockets higher. It depends how you skyrockets higher. It depends how you want to trade it. I simply trade this want to trade it. I simply trade this want to trade it. I simply trade this for very, very shortterm scalp for very, very shortterm scalp for very, very shortterm scalp conditions, but of course, you can trade conditions, but of course, you can trade conditions, but of course, you can trade it on a positional basis as well. It it on a positional basis as well. It it on a positional basis as well. It really, really depends on everything really, really depends on everything really, really depends on everything that you want to do and how you want to that you want to do and how you want to that you want to do and how you want to do it. Now, let's take a look at the do it. Now, let's take a look at the do it. Now, let's take a look at the same concept, but in reverse to the same concept, but in reverse to the same concept, but in reverse to the downside. Again, we're going to look for downside. Again, we're going to look for downside. Again, we're going to look for three key components to make sure that three key components to make sure that three key components to make sure that our trade really plays out. So, first our trade really plays out. So, first our trade really plays out. So, first and foremost, again, we're looking for and foremost, again, we're looking for and foremost, again, we're looking for downtrend. The blue line must be below downtrend. The blue line must be below downtrend. The blue line must be below the red line, as is the case over here, the red line, as is the case over here, the red line, as is the case over here, right? So, we have downtrend in place. right? So, we have downtrend in place. right? So, we have downtrend in place. Let's imagine we'll just go down a Let's imagine we'll just go down a Let's imagine we'll just go down a little bit more longer just to give little bit more longer just to give little bit more longer just to give ourselves a little more room and space ourselves a little more room and space ourselves a little more room and space to determine that is a true downtrend in to determine that is a true downtrend in to determine that is a true downtrend in place. It's been around for uh five, place. It's been around for uh five, place. It's been around for uh five, six, seven bars here. We definitely have six, seven bars here. We definitely have six, seven bars here. We definitely have directional compass. That's um state directional compass. That's um state directional compass. That's um state number one. State number two, we're number one. State number two, we're number one. State number two, we're looking for momentum. Do we have looking for momentum. Do we have looking for momentum. Do we have momentum? Yes, we do. Yes, we do. And um momentum? Yes, we do. Yes, we do. And um momentum? Yes, we do. Yes, we do. And um now our second condition is satisfied. now our second condition is satisfied. now our second condition is satisfied. Now, we're looking for slope. And this Now, we're looking for slope. And this Now, we're looking for slope. And this is where it gets very nuanced and very is where it gets very nuanced and very is where it gets very nuanced and very interesting because what we're looking interesting because what we're looking interesting because what we're looking for is obviously negative slope. You for is obviously negative slope. You for is obviously negative slope. You could make the argument that these two could make the argument that these two could make the argument that these two red dots have a slight negative slope, red dots have a slight negative slope, red dots have a slight negative slope, right? And that this is essentially a right? And that this is essentially a right? And that this is essentially a relatively decent sell signal. And it relatively decent sell signal. And it relatively decent sell signal. And it may very well be. But if you really want may very well be. But if you really want may very well be. But if you really want to be sure, you want to have a steeper to be sure, you want to have a steeper to be sure, you want to have a steeper negative slope, it would really be this negative slope, it would really be this negative slope, it would really be this candle over here. That would be the sell candle over here. That would be the sell candle over here. That would be the sell signal. However, and this is this is um signal. However, and this is this is um signal. However, and this is this is um very important to show, not every signal very important to show, not every signal very important to show, not every signal is going to be perfect. Even though this is going to be perfect. Even though this is going to be perfect. Even though this satisfies all of our conditions, it satisfies all of our conditions, it satisfies all of our conditions, it actually may stop us out if we put a actually may stop us out if we put a actually may stop us out if we put a stop over here. But that's fine because stop over here. But that's fine because stop over here. But that's fine because not the whole idea here is that not not the whole idea here is that not not the whole idea here is that not every structure is going to work but every structure is going to work but every structure is going to work but just that most of them will. I wanted to just that most of them will. I wanted to just that most of them will. I wanted to show you a possible failure just to make show you a possible failure just to make show you a possible failure just to make to explain to you that you have to have to explain to you that you have to have to explain to you that you have to have failures if you want to have successes failures if you want to have successes failures if you want to have successes in any of these trading structures. So in any of these trading structures. So in any of these trading structures. So fine we take a tiny little loss on this fine we take a tiny little loss on this fine we take a tiny little loss on this particular structure and we look for the particular structure and we look for the particular structure and we look for the same idea again. Do we have trend? Yes, same idea again. Do we have trend? Yes, same idea again. Do we have trend? Yes, we do. We have negative trend that we do. We have negative trend that we do. We have negative trend that continues. Do we have momentum? Yes, we continues. Do we have momentum? Yes, we continues. Do we have momentum? Yes, we do. Do we have significant negative do. Do we have significant negative do. Do we have significant negative slope? Yes, we do. Right here. And now slope? Yes, we do. Right here. And now slope? Yes, we do. Right here. And now all three conditions line up perfectly. all three conditions line up perfectly. all three conditions line up perfectly. And the second trade we take falls like And the second trade we take falls like And the second trade we take falls like a stone. It's a waterfall. So the point a stone. It's a waterfall. So the point a stone. It's a waterfall. So the point being here is as long as you have the being here is as long as you have the being here is as long as you have the process, you can be in an absolutely process, you can be in an absolutely process, you can be in an absolutely confident manner that most, not all, but confident manner that most, not all, but confident manner that most, not all, but most of the trade setups you see are most of the trade setups you see are most of the trade setups you see are going to work out in your favor. Now, going to work out in your favor. Now, going to work out in your favor. Now, let's take a look at the same concept, let's take a look at the same concept, let's take a look at the same concept, but on longerterm charts for those of but on longerterm charts for those of but on longerterm charts for those of you that want to think about this you that want to think about this you that want to think about this positionally. So, for those of you who positionally. So, for those of you who positionally. So, for those of you who want to use longerterm charts and maybe want to use longerterm charts and maybe want to use longerterm charts and maybe slower instruments and more positional slower instruments and more positional slower instruments and more positional trades, the system works just as well. trades, the system works just as well. trades, the system works just as well. You could even make the argument it You could even make the argument it You could even make the argument it probably works better because it creates probably works better because it creates probably works better because it creates um longer, bigger, more pippages on um longer, bigger, more pippages on um longer, bigger, more pippages on longerterm charts. Let's take a look at longerterm charts. Let's take a look at longerterm charts. Let's take a look at something like the pound dollar, which something like the pound dollar, which something like the pound dollar, which we're going to put on a 4hour chart over we're going to put on a 4hour chart over we're going to put on a 4hour chart over here. This is a relatively long time here. This is a relatively long time here. This is a relatively long time frame, multi-day type of a trade. And frame, multi-day type of a trade. And frame, multi-day type of a trade. And we're going to go through the same we're going to go through the same we're going to go through the same process of trend, momentum, and slope. process of trend, momentum, and slope. process of trend, momentum, and slope. So, first and foremost, 4hour chart on So, first and foremost, 4hour chart on So, first and foremost, 4hour chart on the pound here. We're looking at the pound here. We're looking at the pound here. We're looking at positive trend. The blue is above the positive trend. The blue is above the positive trend. The blue is above the red. The short-term period moving red. The short-term period moving red. The short-term period moving average 8 above the 200 period moving average 8 above the 200 period moving average 8 above the 200 period moving average. Long-term, we have a compass average. Long-term, we have a compass average. Long-term, we have a compass position of up. The next thing we want position of up. The next thing we want position of up. The next thing we want to look at is momentum. Do we have a to look at is momentum. Do we have a to look at is momentum. Do we have a green dot? Yes, we do. We have a green green dot? Yes, we do. We have a green green dot? Yes, we do. We have a green dot right over here. That's condition dot right over here. That's condition dot right over here. That's condition number two. Condition number three is do number two. Condition number three is do number two. Condition number three is do we have an upward slope? And here again, we have an upward slope? And here again, we have an upward slope? And here again, you could interpret it in a conservative you could interpret it in a conservative you could interpret it in a conservative fashion or in a more aggressive fashion. fashion or in a more aggressive fashion. fashion or in a more aggressive fashion. So in this particular case, the slope So in this particular case, the slope So in this particular case, the slope does exist and it is modestly modestly does exist and it is modestly modestly does exist and it is modestly modestly upward sloping. And maybe that's not upward sloping. And maybe that's not upward sloping. And maybe that's not good enough for you. Maybe you're just good enough for you. Maybe you're just good enough for you. Maybe you're just not satisfied with that. So then you can not satisfied with that. So then you can not satisfied with that. So then you can carefully wait and patiently wait until carefully wait and patiently wait until carefully wait and patiently wait until you actually get a clean, clear upward you actually get a clean, clear upward you actually get a clean, clear upward slope over here. Once you have this slope over here. Once you have this slope over here. Once you have this third condition, you're in the trade. third condition, you're in the trade. third condition, you're in the trade. You're in the trade over here. And once You're in the trade over here. And once You're in the trade over here. And once you're in this trade over here, you can you're in this trade over here, you can you're in this trade over here, you can see it has a multiple multiple long-term see it has a multiple multiple long-term see it has a multiple multiple long-term move here for uh hundreds of pips, move here for uh hundreds of pips, move here for uh hundreds of pips, right? You go from 30 basically 30. 80 to right? You go from 30 basically 30. 80 to right? You go from 30 basically 30. 80 to about 3, 400 over a matter of several about 3, 400 over a matter of several about 3, 400 over a matter of several days. very little stress, very little uh days. very little stress, very little uh days. very little stress, very little uh push back, all of it because you are push back, all of it because you are push back, all of it because you are fully confirmed on all three indicators fully confirmed on all three indicators fully confirmed on all three indicators in the right direction. As I said in the in the right direction. As I said in the in the right direction. As I said in the beginning, financial markets are like a beginning, financial markets are like a beginning, financial markets are like a river. We are just looking to join the river. We are just looking to join the river. We are just looking to join the flow at the optimal point and let it flow at the optimal point and let it flow at the optimal point and let it carry us to the point of profit. If you carry us to the point of profit. If you carry us to the point of profit.
