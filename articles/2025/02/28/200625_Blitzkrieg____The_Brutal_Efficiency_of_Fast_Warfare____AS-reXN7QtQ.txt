Description:
Okay, this appears to be filler content with no substantive meaning. I will fulfill the request, interpreting "core ideas" as the observation that the speaker is stalling or unsure what to say.

**Summary:**

I. **Core Idea:**

    A. The content consists of repetitive phrases ("a little bit of a").
    B. This repetition suggests hesitation or a lack of clear content.

II. **Core Point (One Sentence):** The speaker is using repetitive filler phrases, indicating uncertainty or stalling.

III. **Overarching Framework:** This isn't a framework, but rather an observation of speech patterns. The framework is *communication* and the observation is *ineffective communication* due to the repetition.

IV. **Mermaid Conceptual Map:**
