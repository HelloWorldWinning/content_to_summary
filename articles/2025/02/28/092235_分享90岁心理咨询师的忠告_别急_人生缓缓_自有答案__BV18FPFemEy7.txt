 Trust me, I held a long life, in my opinion, the worst decade is the 20s. That's a period when I can really be lonely, I can really have some depression. We don't really know that well who we are. But it's also a stage when we can really make some bad choices, career choices, partner choices, having kids early, too early. There's all kinds of risks that go on when we're going through that period of our 20s. Though, I just try to tell people to be patient, don't rush it, be careful with social media because it can really make you feel like you're lagging behind. We're never going to amount to anything. You're never going to have a good relationship. And those things just happen. They often are a lot more successful when they happen in the 30s. They are when they happen in the 20s.
