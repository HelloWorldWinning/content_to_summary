Content:
 Whenever you see these steep exponential curves in technology, you shouldn't bet against them. And I think you should all be very skeptical when people start saying, this is about to run out of it. That's about to run out of it. We're going to hit this limit. It does look to us like we have this fundamental unlock of an algorithm that can really truly learn, and that's going to keep going. We will hit stumbling blocks, we'll have to figure out how to overcome them. But I think we will get to AGI and beyond, and it'll just be a pretty smooth scaling from here.
