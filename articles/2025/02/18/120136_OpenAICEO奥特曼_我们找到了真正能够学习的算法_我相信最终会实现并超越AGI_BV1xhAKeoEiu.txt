Description:
**Core Point:** Exponential technological advancements, particularly in AI algorithms, are likely to continue despite predictions of limitations, suggesting a relatively smooth path towards AGI and beyond.

**Overarching Framework:** The content presents a perspective on the trajectory of technological progress, specifically focusing on AI. It argues against skepticism regarding the limitations of exponential growth and suggests that current breakthroughs in AI algorithms indicate continued progress towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and beyond. The framework acknowledges potential obstacles but expresses confidence in overcoming them.

Content:
 Whenever you see these steep exponential curves in technology, you shouldn't bet against them. And I think you should all be very skeptical when people start saying, this is about to run out of it. That's about to run out of it. We're going to hit this limit. It does look to us like we have this fundamental unlock of an algorithm that can really truly learn, and that's going to keep going. We will hit stumbling blocks, we'll have to figure out how to overcome them. But I think we will get to AGI and beyond, and it'll just be a pretty smooth scaling from here.
