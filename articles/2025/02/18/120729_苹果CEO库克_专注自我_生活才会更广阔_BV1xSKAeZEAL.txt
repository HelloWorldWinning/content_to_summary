Content:
 I found that my life got bigger when I stopped caring what other people thought about me. You will find yours will too. Stay focused on what really matters. Don't let that noise knock you off course. Don't get caught up in the trivial aspects of life. Don't listen to trolls and don't become one. As you're in fact on humanity, not in lights, but in the lives you touch. Not in popularity, but in the people you serve.
