Description:
**核心思想:** 睡眠对于学习效果至关重要，其影响程度远超预期，并且睡眠时间、规律性和截止时间都会对学习成绩产生显著影响。

**总结大纲:**

1.  **引言:** MIT 教授们的研究意外发现睡眠与学习效果之间存在显著关联。
2.  **研究设计:**

    *   教授们原本旨在研究锻炼与学习效果之间的联系，但未能找到相关性。
    *   通过Fitbit收集学生睡眠数据。
3.  **主要发现:**

    *   睡眠时间：平均睡眠时间在 6.5 小时/晚的学生，课程成绩比睡眠时间多 1 小时的学生低 50%。
    *   睡眠规律性：睡眠时间变化大的学生，成绩下降 45%。
    *   睡眠截止时间：2 点以后睡觉，即使保证睡眠时长，学习效果也会下降。
    *   考前睡眠：考前一晚的睡眠质量对考试成绩没有明显影响。
4.  **结论:** 睡眠质量，睡眠时长和规律性对于学习至关重要。

**总结：** 睡眠质量与学习成绩呈正相关，包括规律作息和充足睡眠，并且需要注意不要晚于凌晨两点睡觉。

**框架:** 睡眠与学习成绩的关系研究。

 Science tells us there is one thing more important than any other if you want to learn effectively. And I'm going to show you what that is. But first, I need to take you back in time. Just a few years. It's October 2019. Two professors from MIT are sitting in a cramped office staring at the results of their most recent study. They'd rather be at home, cup of tea in one hand, favourite book in the other, perhaps with a murder mystery drama on the TV in the background. But they can't. Because the results in the spreadsheet on the screen in front of them. They don't make any sense. They'll carefully design the study to find a link between learning and one specific activity. But the results are showing irrefutable evidence between learning and something else entirely. It's unexpected, unplanned and unexplained. Thank you for watching. My name's Giles, and on this channel I explore topics about learning science and learning and science. If that sounds good to you, then join us and subscribe. You'll be very welcome. Just what is it that surprised them so? Professors John Gabrielli and Jeffrey Grossman gave 100 of their MIT chemistry students fit bits. But they weren't just being generous. There were a few conditions attached to the gift. The students had to wear them continually for a whole semester and grant access to their activity data to their researchers. And a quarter of the students had to enroll in an intense fitness class. The professors were looking for a link between level of exercise and academic performance. But it didn't matter how much they searched through that data. They just couldn't find one. As Jeffrey Grossman put it, What we found at the end of the day was zero correlation with fitness, which I must say was disappointing. Since I believed and still believe, there is a tremendous positive impact of exercise on cognitive performance. But they did find something else lurking in the data. A signal so strong it was shouting at them. What was it? Sleep. The researchers weren't surprised that there's a link between sleep and performance. It was the extent of the link that surprised them. Out of all that noisy data, the relationship between amount of sleep and performance in tests or exams was a straight line. Sleep really matters. But there's more. As they picked apart the data, they found insights that are useful to all students. In fact, they're useful to anybody. Some of the findings in the data were quite surprising. For example, cut off times. Now, you've always told you this, but you didn't believe her. The later you go to bed, the worse your performance, even if you get the same amount of sleep as someone who goes to bed earlier. There is a cut off time. What is it? It's 2am. Go to bed later than that and your performance will deteriorate no matter how much sleep you get. Now, what about the night before a test? You need a good night's sleep, yes? Actually, no. Grossman studies show that this doesn't contribute to an improvement in scores. It doesn't matter. What does matter is the quality of sleep at the time the learning is taking place, which probably shouldn't be the night before. So how big an effect does sleep have on academic performance? When they looked at the data to try to answer this question, they found that the effect is huge. Course grades for students averaging 6.5 hours sleep a night were down 50% on those averaging just one hour more. What about variation? Say if the amount of sleep you get varies by 30 minutes a night. Students in this category had grades that dropped by 45% below others who had less variation. Anything else? Yes, consistency. Students getting a consistent amount of sleep each night. On average, scored higher than those with greater variation, even if the total amount of sleep for the week was the same. Sleep well.
