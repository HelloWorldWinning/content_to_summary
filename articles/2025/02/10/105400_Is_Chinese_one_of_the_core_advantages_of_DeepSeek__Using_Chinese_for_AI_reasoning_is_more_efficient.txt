recently I've been experimenting with deep seek I set up the R1 model locally and integrated it into my applications using deep seeks official API key whether it's answering questions searching the web assisting with programming editing or translating video scripts the experience has been a qualitative leap you might not believe it but the translation performance of my locally deployed are 114b model far surpasses that of Google or opena I while working on a Bollywood related video I mentioned an Indian film titled jender Singh since the chines name only includes sing neither GPT nor Gemini could accurately translate the film title Gemini even mistakenly translated it as another Indian film containing Singh however my local deep seek r one model accurately translated the title and clarified my doubts it didn't use internet connectivity but had learned the information during its local data training based on my observations it likely distilled data from open AI models as it mentioned its data cut off was September 2023 strangely GPT couldn't accurately translate the film title which suggests deep seek has some unique expertise in logical reasoning what surprised me even more is its understanding of Economic and political topics which far exceeds that of GPT or Gemini it provides detailed reasoning processes in Chinese something that GPT or Gemini often fail to deliver satisfactorily as a YouTube Creator focused on discussing politics economics and Technology I found deep seek indispensible for example when I asked it how long the US Dollar's hegemony would last it accurately understood my question and provided an excellent answer the Dollar's dominance won't collapse in the short term but there are several major challenges that could have profound impacts on it in the short medium and long term its reasoning process is highly similar to human thinking a quality that GPT or Gemini rarely achieve when it comes to Chinese reasoning composing classical Chinese poetry is an ultimate test for AI classical Chinese poetry not only demands High grammatical Precision but also requires AI to create works with humanlike artistic conception otherwise it's hard to produce highquality pieces in the field of classical Chinese poetry GPT and Gemini are like kindergarten students while deep seek often creates works that impress me it also accurately explains its creative process in Chinese and its poetic skills can be described as masterful in other words deep seek truly possesses a certain level of humanlike thinking ability those who don't understand and Chinese might struggle to grasp the fundamental differences between deep seek and other large models like GPT but this Innovation is truly groundbreaking in my previous videos I've mentioned multiple times that the Transformer architecture is not the ultimate answer to AI of course all current large models are improved versions of the Transformer architecture and they are unlikely to achieve true AGI however the emergence of deep seek might provide a relatively clear direction for improvement when major AI Giants fully grasp the Deep seek model they might draw inspiration from it and steer AI toward its intended path biomimicry I've always believed that although current computing power cannot support the immense demands of biomimicry approaches biomimicry is the inevitable path to achieving AI if silicon based chips can achieve this we can look forward to the maturity of quantum chips of course I've also mentioned in previous videos that AI large models are particularly suitable for Quantum Computing while Quantum Computing is unlikely to be practical for general purpose Computing in the short term it could be applied to specific algorithms in the foreseeable future if Innovative teams like deep seek abstract the highly compute intensive logical parts of their AI models into Asic logic and then use quantum chips for computation The evolutionary progress would be exponential another interesting topic is that deep seeks efficiency is partly due to its Chinese reasoning logic in other words the efficiency of the Chinese language and logical expression gives deep seek and Energy Efficiency advantage over English native large models as a programmer I'm not sure about the technical basis for these claims but as a product of a Chinese Tech Team Deep seeks logical Proficiency in Chinese far surpasses that of foreign products like GPT and Gemini this Gap isn't due to simple translation but rather the model's inherent Proficiency in Chinese I believe that no matter how GPT or Gemini optimize it's unlikely they'll catch up to deep seek in Chinese applications this isn't just because they can't write highquality classical Chinese poetry like deep seek but also because English native thinkers can't fully grasp the efficiency of Chinese let me give a simple example when I write a video script it's usually around 2, 500 to 3, 000 Chinese characters when translated into English the character count balloons to 8, 000 to 10, 000 if my video is purely in Chinese tools like cap cut can automatically match subtitles for up to 5, 000 characters in one go perfectly meeting my needs however if I translate the script into English for an English video I need to match subtitles twice which increases my workload and consumes consumes more time additionally for the same video the AI voiceover cost for the Chinese version is only onethird of that for the English version although my English speaking and vocabulary skills are limited I can generally think in English when watching English movies I understand them directly in English without translating the content into Chinese back when I was a programmer I mostly thought in English while coding however when creating video I found that thinking in English is far less efficient than thinking in Chinese writing the script in Chinese and then translating it into English using AI is much more efficient than writing in English and using AI to correct grammar errors this has led me to a longstanding thought Chinese programmers might not necessarily be more skilled than their Western counterparts but thinking in Chinese is more efficient than thinking in English therefore Chinese programmers might face some disadvantages in language proficiency requiring Higher Learning costs compared to foreigners however the efficiency of Chinese thinking allows Chinese programmers to produce more code in the same amount of time compared to users of other languages moreover thinking in Chinese can significantly enhance one's logical abilities the diligence of Chinese people might be related to their faster thinking once the human brain enters a high speed operational state it generates a certain inertia immersing the person and making them more focused of course these are unscientific fantasies for reference only as a Chinese I am glad that I learned English when I was young it allowed me to break away from the limitations of the Chinese internet and obtain more firsthand information which broadened my horizons and maintained independent thinking to avoid being brainwashed by any organization after after I matured I gradually discovered that the breadth and depth of Chinese and Chinese culture have benefited ordinary Chinese people a lot Mandarin Chinese is the most used language in the world and it has a huge ecosystem the unique high efficiency of Chinese and the fierce competition in Chinese Society make the survival ability of ordinary Chinese people stand out in the world at a time when AI is developing rapidly and may change human soci Society mastering the two most important languages has become an important guarantee for my survival the 21st century is the Chinese century and China is also becoming the core area of global technological change spending some time learning Chinese May really change your life
