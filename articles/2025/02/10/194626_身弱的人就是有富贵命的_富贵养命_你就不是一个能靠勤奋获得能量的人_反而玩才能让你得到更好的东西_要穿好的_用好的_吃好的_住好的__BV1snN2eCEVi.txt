Description:
Okay, here's a summary of the content, structured as requested:

**Summary:**

1.  **Core Ideas:**

    *   **"深落" (Shen Luo) individuals (deeply immersed individuals):** These individuals are believed to have a predisposition to wealth and good fortune.
    *   **Wealth Cultivation:** Instead of relying on external resources or connections (e.g., "秦奋"), "深落" individuals should cultivate their own wealth through enjoyment and self-care.
    *   **Material Indulgence:** Prioritize high-quality goods and experiences: wear fine clothes, use quality items, eat well, and live comfortably.
    *   **Environmental Sensitivity:** "深落" individuals are highly susceptible to external influences.
    *   **Self-Investment:** Invest in expensive, high-quality items for oneself.
    *   **Decluttering and Renewal:** Regularly declutter, discard, and replace items in the home. Maintain cleanliness and order.
    *   **Avoid Frugality:** Don't be overly concerned with minor expenses ("不要对计砸误").

2.  **Core Point:**  Wealth and fortune for "深落" individuals stem from self-care, material indulgence, and a clean, orderly environment, rather than relying on external forces.

3.  **Fundamental Point:**  One's personal environment and self-investment are crucial for cultivating prosperity, especially for those perceived as inherently susceptible to external influences.

4.  **Overarching Framework:**  The content presents a philosophy of self-cultivation where material indulgence and environmental control are key to attracting and maintaining wealth for individuals with a specific inherent disposition ("深落").

5.  **Conceptual Map:**
