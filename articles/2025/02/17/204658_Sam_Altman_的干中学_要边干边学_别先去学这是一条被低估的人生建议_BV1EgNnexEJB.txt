Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Core Idea:** The most effective way to improve at a skill (X) is to directly practice that skill (X), rather than focusing solely on acquiring related skills (A, B, C) in preparation.

2.  **Supporting Arguments:**

    *   Direct practice allows for quicker learning.
    *   Indirect skill acquisition can be less efficient and relevant.

3. **Core Point:** Direct practice is the most efficient path to skill mastery.

4. **Overarching Framework:** The content presents a practical approach to skill acquisition, advocating for immediate engagement with the desired skill over preparatory skill-building.

5. **Mermaid Diagram:**

Content:
 I am a big believer that if you want to like get good at something, you get good at it by just doing the thing. I think this is like a surprisingly underrated piece of life advice. You know, if you're like trying to do thing X, you go build up skills like A, B, and C, so that like you think they'll apply to X later. But you should have just been like working on X as quickly as you could and like learning that. And that's certain that I would say for this.
