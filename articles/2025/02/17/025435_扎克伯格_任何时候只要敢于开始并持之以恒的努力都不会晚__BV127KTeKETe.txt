Description:
Here's a summary of the provided content, following all instructions:

1.  **Core Point:** The core point is that you don't need to have a perfect, fully-formed idea to begin; starting and iterating is the key to clarity and success.

2.  **Overarching Framework:** The framework contrasts the realistic process of idea development (iterative, gradual) with the misleading, romanticized portrayal of instant, "Eureka" moments often depicted in popular culture. It argues against the latter as a barrier to entry.

3.  **Conceptual Map:**

Content:
 Let me tell you a secret. No one does when they begin. Ideas don't come out fully formed. They only become clear as you work on them. You just have to get started. If I had to know everything about connecting people before I got started, I never would have built Facebook. Movies and pop culture just get this all wrong. The idea of a single Eureka moment is a dangerous lie. It makes us feel inadequate because we feel like we haven't had ours yet. And it prevents people with seeds of good ideas from ever getting started in the first place.
