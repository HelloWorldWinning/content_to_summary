I mean 34 it's so young Donald if it was a life and death situation which one would you choose I would probably choose love you would I think so yes Abraham Lincoln would probably not be electable today because of Television he was not a handsome man and he did not smile at all cuz I I do understand it's all basically a game we're all here to play the game and we're all hopefully going to play it well but some people obviously can't play it well because if everyone played it well you'd you have a pretty unusual situation but the game is being played Now by me and by plenty of other people and the people that enjoy it are the people that are going to win it and I really do I think people I think many people have lost incentives I think that you know with what's happening with even the country as a whole it's a sad situation and people sort of become a little depressed and their own depression and the country's depression leads to that lack of incentive and becoming wealthy or becoming successful or becoming whatever the word is when you say becoming anything I think it largely has to do with incentive and drive and enthusiasm you are 34 years old your assets are considered to be over a billion dollars where did you get the incentive I mean 34 it's so young Donald well I don't look at really in my case necessarily incentive I enjoy what I'm doing I really enjoy what I'm doing I look at it as being somewhat creative I enjoy what I do I like what I do and it's not that I'm looking for anything I just enjoy it when I get up in the morning I'm I'm excited about the day is work your love it really is I enjoy so much my work and I think that's probably the key to anybody's success is there anything you can't have well I believe if you think that you can't have it you probably won't have it you have to go into everything with a positive attitude but in terms of specifics I totally agree about positive thinking but you is there anything you can't have materialistically or emotionally is there something that your money cannot buy well it's a very nice question Ron I'm not sure that there's an answer to it I mean I'm quite happy with everything I'm quite happy with the way by the way money is not the ingredient money has nothing to do with the ingredient it just whether I was a you know an artist and just pushing my work and enjoying my work whatever it is I think you just have to be happy in what you do in my case by the way my art is my real estate and my buildings and if the deals work out well that makes me happy because that's sort of a sign of accomplishment but um that's pretty much the way I feel about it do you think that the acquisition of wealth though is an absolute aphrodesiac no not at all in fact I think in many cases it really creates problems that you normally wouldn't have like what well many you're expected to be a certain kind of a person and maybe you're not necessarily cut out to be that kind of a person you know you're cast very much as as being in the movies you're cast in a certain role and maybe your role isn't that roll after 7: 00 or 6: 00 or 5: 00 or whatever it is that you come back home from the office there are things and pressures placed on you that normally you wouldn't have and I've often said the happiest people tend to be the people that are making a nice income that really enjoy their life and their family life and and and not the people of tremendous wealth that are constantly driven to achieve more and more success but when is enough enough obviously there must have been a time a point when you knew that you would be secure for the rest of your life your family your relatives whomever why do you go on well I go on really because I enjoy it I really enjoy when I when I think about my business I think about it literally 24 hours a day and I really enjoy it if I didn't I will stop there's no question in my mind that I'll stop because I I do understand it's all basically a game we're all here to play the game and we're all hopefully going to play it well but some people obviously can't play it well because if everyone played it well you'd uh you'd have a pretty unusual situation but the game is being played Now by me and by plenty of other people and the people that enjoy it are the people that are going to win it in my opinion when you win is there sometimes a time when you also lose because in winning there is also losing have you ever lost well I guess you can say I I would imagine everybody's lost lost at some point or another if you had to if I had to at this point in my life look at any particular business transaction or anything I could say that I have not lost in that regard are you always so lucky from the time you were a little boy I guess the answer and by the way a word a very important word you just mentioned is luck there no matter how bright a person may be there is always that element of luck and yet the interesting phenomena to me seems to be that the same people are always lucky so maybe they create their own luck or they make their own luck but I've been I would say that I've certainly had my share of luck yes tell me about the early days of Donald Trump I mean were you born into wealth I mean was your father I know your father was successful but when you came along was he already successful oh yes my father was very successful and my father U he my father Built Homes and apartment houses and various sections and did very well a big deal a small deal no matter what deal you're ever in even though you may win in the final analysis sometimes a door gets closed in your face how do you get those doors open what makes you go on well you do get many doors closed there's no question about that R that's something that's happened in in many cases and I guess I guess you just have to keep going I guess you really just have to keep pushing and just get going and a funny thing is once you open the first door it becomes a lot easier to open the second door there was an article we recently that headlined like father like son are you like your dad well I hope so I have a very wonderful father and I would hope I'd be somewhat like my father what's he like strong Dynamic gentleman is he loving kind absolutely absolutely totally could you go to him anytime you had a problem was he that kind of a father absolutely I could yes I mean you're you're always going to be criticized no matter what you do and you have to realize it and you really have to Dev a little bit of a tough skin and if you don't you really cannot survive I suspect doing anything of any great importance do you like having a tough skin do you think you have to have a Killer Instinct in order to be successful I think you have to have some to to a large extent I think you do have to have at least a winning winning Instinct I think that um the world is made up of people with either Killer Instincts or without Killer Instincts and the people that seem to emerge all the time it doesn't mean they're the best people on doesn't mean they're the happiest people and in fact many in many cases and in most cases they're probably not but the people that seem to emerge is are the people that are competitive and driven and with a certain instinct to win they use the word competitive and driven I'd like to know what drives you enjoyment pure and simple enjoyment Rona I I want to buy the enjoyment but somehow I feel that there is something underneath it that there's something more that makes you want to succeed want to be who you are well what do you think it is maybe I can just yeah but maybe I could just add the word creativity I really enjoy creating and maybe this is my form of creativity you know building a 68 story building on Fifth Avenue is my form of creativity and making it the finest not only the location but instead of building an average building we're going to make it the finest building in the world and maybe that's my form of of enjoyment which gives me a little bit more Drive than somebody else may or may not have which allows me to do these things but um I I feel that enjoyment really has a large part to do with it creativity and just just uh incentive just having the incentive to go out and do something marriage is a very important thing for people I I fully believe it I think that having the home and having the stability and I've had it all different ways I mean I've had it the other way and I've had it the marriage way and I think think that marriage is a very important having a good wife and having a nice family is a very very important uh there is no substitute for it frankly there really is no substitute for it are you friends yes absolutely with my wife absolutely absolutely is it important I think it's I think it's the most important thing I mean you have to be best friends if you're not going to be best friends and the marriage cannot work no matter what the other ingredients are the marriage really can't work I mean this is a strange question to ask but God God forbid you got sick in the middle of the night and your wife and your child weren't around and your housekeeper wasn't around and your parents weren't around who would you call if you were in trouble maybe I'll call you ra you know I mean you're such a nice woman and you look like you know you know your way around certainly so maybe I give you a little buzz well I always like to say that I think my deals are the most exciting deals I don't necessarily want the excitement for myself and um I've always been somewhat guarded about that I mean I do think we probably have and I'm not saying it it's been recognized that we have the most exciting real estate transactions in in the country at this moment and uh I would say that uh I think they're very by themselves they are very exciting and that satisfies me that's my excitement is is is really seeing what happens with them you are a mover you are a doer if you could make America perfect how would you do it well it should be a it should really be a country that gets the respect of other countries today respect the most important thing in your opinion well respect can lead to other things when you get the respect of the other countries then the other countries tend to do a little bit as you do and you can create the right attitudes the the Iranian situation is a case in point that they hold our hostages is just absolutely and totally ridiculous if we were respected properly respected as a country and as a people and as a nation I don't think that you would have the war going on right now between Iran and Iraq I don't think that Iran would have our hostages for 10 minutes if they respected this country I don't believe they would have our hostages for 10 minutes would you like to be the president of the United States I really don't believe I would Rona but I would like to see somebody as the president who could do the job and they were very capable people in this country somebody with no Great Brain but a big smile and that's a sad commentary for the political process television in a strange way has ruined that process hasn't it it's hurt the process very much I mean the Abraham Lincoln of the world Abraham Lincoln would probably not be electable today because of Television he was not a handsome man and he did not smile at all he would not be considered to be a prime candidate for the presidency and that's a shame isn't it the one man could turn this country around the one proper president could turn this country around I firmly believe that you think there is one man there is one man that can turn this country around around if you lost your fortune today what would you do tomorrow maybe I'd run for president I don't know you mean you think you have to be uh bankrupt uh with not a dime in your pocket in order to uh be a a good president no I'm only kidding you know when I say that of course I'm being somewhat factious do you think wealth corrupts no I think it can but I don't think it does in all cases certainly can corrupt Freud said that there were two things in in life love and work if you had to choose one which would you choose I think I don't think I could choose one I think I choose both and I think they can both work hand in hand in fact I think your love can be increased and I think your work can be increased by the other I believe they can each increase the value of the other but if you had to choose one if it was a life and death situation which one would you choose I would probably choose love you would I think so yes despite the fact that you spend all your time working achieving creating well you know when I say love I'm also saying it in the positive sense that I also consider my work to be love so I I assume that I can get away with that little uh little answer and we can maybe leave it at that how would you like to be remembered well as somebody that's contributed something to the United States and to the city of New York and to the various other places that I'm going and and uh somebody that's uh done a little bit better than other people at what he does I thank you thank you Ronda very much thank you
