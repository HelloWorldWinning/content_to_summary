Description:
好的，下面是对给定内容的总结和分析：

**1. 要点概述 (Outline and Structure):**

*   **AI 的潜在不平等 (Potential Inequality of AI):**
    *   AI 革命可能不会在全球范围内平均分配，导致一些国家在技术上占据主导地位，加剧现有的不平等。
    *   历史重演与新差异并存：过去的发现使人类控制外部世界，而现在，AI 赋予人类控制内部世界（思想、身体）的力量，这可能导致比以往任何时候都更大的差异。

*   **对人类精神的理解不足 (Lack of Understanding of Human Spirit):**
    *   人类对自身的精神和心理了解甚少，这并不妨碍我们获得操纵自身的能力。
    *   这可能导致精神崩溃，类似于我们现在看到的生态崩溃。

*   **人类的适应性与退化 (Human Adaptability and Deterioration):**
    *   人类具有惊人的适应能力，但这种适应往往是片面的，以满足经济和政治体系的需求。
    *   现代技术（如连接到网络）可能会使我们脱离身体，导致异化和压力，并付出巨大的精神代价。

*   **历史学家的角色与局限 (Role and Limitation of Historians):**
    *   历史学研究变化，但历史学家不是预言家，无法准确预测未来。
    *   人们阅读历史著作以寻求生存指南，但对文本的解读可能与作者的意图相悖（例如，从耶稣的教义到宗教战争）。

*   **耶路撒冷的冲突与反思 (Conflict and Reflection in Jerusalem):**
    *   耶路撒冷是宗教冲突的中心，充满仇恨，是一个“失灵的圣殿”。
    *   这种环境促使人们思考虚构故事的力量，以及现代世界与古老神话之间的紧张关系。
    *   在以色列，人们对于“真正的阿拉伯人”存在刻板印象。

*   **学术研究与人生大问题 (Academic Research and Big Questions of Life):**
    *   学术界往往关注狭窄的专业问题，而个人可能对人生的大问题更感兴趣。
    *   获得终身教职后，有可能将这两个方向结合起来。
    *   杰拉德·戴蒙德（Jared Diamond）对作者有很大影响，他展示了从“鸟瞰”的角度看待人类的可能性。

*   **作者理论的潜在缺陷 (Potential Flaws of Author's Theory):**
    *   作者承认自己的理论存在缺陷，特别是在缺乏第一手经验的领域（如人工智能），他只能依赖专家的观点。

*   **犹太教育的悖论 (Paradox of Jewish Education):**
    *   犹太教育既有宗教的坚持（永恒真理），又有对新技术和新知识的开放。
    *   《塔木德》体现了开放讨论的精神，鼓励人们从不同来源获取知识。

**2. 核心结论 (Core Point):**

人类正处于一个历史性的转折点，人工智能的发展赋予了我们前所未有的改造自身的能力，但我们对自身精神和心理的理解不足，这可能导致严重的后果，需要我们在拥抱技术的同时，深入反思人类的本质和未来。

**3. 总体框架 (Overarching Framework):**

内容的总体框架是**技术进步与人类自我理解的冲突**。它探讨了人工智能带来的机遇和风险，以及人类在快速变化的世界中如何保持自我认知和精神健康。作者从历史、个人经历和文化观察等多个角度，分析了技术、社会、宗教和个人之间的复杂关系。

that the new powers of artificial intelligence will be shared equally between all the countries in the world it's much more likely that some countries will lead this new Revolution they will be able to dominate and Conquer and exploit all the others in an even more extreme way so some things repeat themselves but other things are really different I would say that maybe the most uh important difference is that in the past almost all the inventions and discoveries they gave people control of the world outside we learned how to control the other animals the forests the rivers but we never gained much power over the world inside us and this is the big change that will happen in the 21st century Powers we are gaining is power over the internal world to re-engineer and manufacture bodies and brains and minds I think Earth will be dominated by entities which are more different from us than we are different from neand or from chimpanzees do do you do you feel that you maybe sometimes you underestimated the human spirit I mean from late Century maybe from Freud they try to explore your psychology and also Virginia World said the human Spirit changed totally but really change you right um we know very little about the mind and about uh the spirit of the psychology of humans it won't prevent us from Gaining immense manipulative Powers over ourselves and this is one of the ders we had control we had power to manipulate the world outside we didn't understand the ecological system and the same thing may happen with the world inside we are far from understanding the human Spirit or the human mind and the result may be that we will face a mental collapse similar to the ecological collapse we are seeing now I think we are facing the the danger of the destructions maybe human spirit is much more adaptive than we think and we imagine it is very adaptive that's that's certainly true and we see it here that you know we we still have the the the Stone Age bodies and stone AG brains and we here we are flying in airplanes and then living in big cities and so forth so we have an amazing ability to adapt but um what we see is a process of domestication of humans we adapt the abilities that the economic system needs from us the political system needs from us but we neglect H many other potential abilities that are deteriorating this is what happened to the other domesticated animals we created cows that produce enormous amounts of milk but otherwise they are far less capable than Wild cutle now what the economic system needs from us is to constantly connect to the communication system and all the new technologies what they are doing is drawing us out of our body disconnecting us from our senses from our from our body and connecting us instead to cyberspace if you don't feel at home in your body you will never feel at home in the world my impression is that the number number one cause for the feeling of alienation and stress which has huge economic advantages but the mental price is very very big for m for m for for for foree for as a historian most of the insights you gain by looking at how things changed in the past but then once you you understand the mechanism of change you can use this understanding to try and say something about the future how do you evaluate your own Visionary capability um I hope they're good I think history is really the study of change yeah historians their speciality is to study how things change in the world mhm I mean it's so funny or very paradoxical you're trained as historian but people ask you like you are Prophet about future so how do you think about the of course and I try to clarify it but people don't always want to listen I try to clarify it that I'm not a prophet I'm not making predictions nobody knows what the world would be like in 30 or 50 years it's impossible it's now many people read your books because they want to survive in the in the future yeah it's become a new social D so how how do you react I mean their reading well you know um this is one of the problems of writing books and being an author that you have no control of the way in which people read your books yeah and I I see in many cases like I write a passage in an ironic tone for me it's obvious that this is irony and I think everybody who reads it will understand I don't mean it seriously it's just in in IR get it and they don't get get it I in a completely flat and serious way and they understand exactly the opposite of what I intended so when you in state you talk about this so you feel strong elated from the reality so it sometimes happens with some people and you just have to accept that I mean there is no way to write something that people will always understand you you think about I don't know say the the the the Bible yeah yeah so you have Jesus coming and telling his disciples if somebody slaps you on on the on the cheek turn the other cheek and you should have only love for all people and somehow people read this and they burn Heretics and they start religious wars I mean how if if it's possible to get from Jesus to religious wars then people can just you know do with texts almost anything they they like um I mean again I try to predict the future I try to point out different possibilities and I hope that like Huxley I'm offering an interesting Visions yeah okay do you mind people call you Guru I don't like it but I have no control over them okay hope in Israel maybe we we are maybe plan go there to see you there Israel yeah thank you a very interesting very interesting uh it's not the usual questions yeah we should talk more Ian time take care you too need why need w for for for for foree for welcome to hi see you again hello hi nice to meet you see you again how are you nice to meet you nice me so where to go we need the car yeah we yeah yeah please you know I just travel from the Jerusalem The Old City you see the different culture different region and I mean we're mixed mixed culture and a lots of Burden from history is there kind of Israeli mentality could you describe it uh as a tourist maybe you go there oh it's very interesting all you see all all the old places all the this is where Jesus was and so forth but you live there the amount of hatred in that place it's like a nuclear reactor of hatred you know religion can be a wonderful thing but when you live in Jerusalem you realize that it can be a terrible thing how much hatred and anger ideally a temple or a religious place is a place where you go in to experience peace and Harmony uh if you go to a temple and you experience hatred and anger then this is a dysfunctional Temple it's it's not working you know it's like going to a hospital and getting back even more sick so Jerusalem for me is a dysfunctional Temple how how this kind of thing shape your shape your mind shape your uh the influence on me of if if this is what you ask it obviously has an impact I mean if you live in a place like Silicon Valley maybe you can have this kind of utopian vision of a world governed by science and by rationality and things like that but if you live in the middle the least it's obvious to you that you cannot escape this tension because all around you people are killing each other because of their belief in fictional stories so you uh it's very clear to you that fiction is extremely powerful thing um my house my the the the village where I live is exactly middle of the way between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem to the one hand I'm very connected to this world of Tel Aviv yeah modern technology technology Hightech all that and on the other very connected to Jerusalem with all the uh uh religion and mythology and and especially this is why I think much of my writing and scholarship is about this tension between the modern world of the 21st century artificial intelligence and then all that and on the other hand the the still great impact of all these mythologies and and fictional stories and and and religions when did you notice the tension when did you notice the I mean the hatred of buig and I mean I think only when I left Israel and I went to do my PhD in Oxford then I realized how much tension there is in the place or you know when you're born into it you think well this is how the world is and only when you go out you realize no this is not about yeah yeah hi nice to meet you how do you thing about the Jewish people I mean the Jewish come back take the city they become the new Authority is understanding or for you not for me I don't have a problem with the religion about the Jews and they was living here before the occupation and we have places that they are neighbors of the Arabs and they don't have any problem with the Palestinian here before the occupation uh when they kick them out from Europe and receive them and later they are get of this country but after it's begin the problem when I talk with the Israelis most of the people they uh have this stereotype we really feel that when they talking with me are you real Arab yeah I am Arab are you born here yes I am born here you know here the thing that it's helped me to live here in Jerusalem it's how I look according to the stereotype of the Israelis I'm not look like the local people the local people have to be dark skinned uh not handsome person uh and also my accent is good in Hebrew m you speak Hebrew yeah of course because I am a lawyer and in a good accent uh so what's your nationality nationality I don't have any nationality of any country it's just the residency if I pass something if I travel more than three or seven years out of Israel so they can get the ID my id M it's mean they can kick me out anytime like that we live do you have any solution I mean actually I don't see any solution I am born here and I love this country I will not pass to anywhere well got a car oh oh it's okay it's okay it's okay when did you sorry when did you come to two days ago oh two days AG been around yeah SP one day in Jerusalem and here yeah come his yeah are you much more relaxed than in China me yeah yeah because you know in China you run around from here to many things yeah oh nice view uh you want some water uh yes would be nice tell me more about I mean you're self-searching in Oxford your life your thinking of mentality how the change happened yeah how the change happened yeah um well I I went to Oxford to do my my PhD on military history mhm I was always very interested in the big questions of Life yeah what are we doing here and what is the meaning of life and what is the source of suffering in the world and things like that but I got the impression that you couldn't really engage with these questions in the academic world MH the academic world is kind of pushing you to focus on more and more narrow and specialized questions on a parallel track I'm personally very engaged and interested in these big philosophical questions big tension for you yeah when I got my 10e the university I felt that okay now I'm kind of secure now they can't do anything to me I some terrible crime like you murder you murder the dean or something they can't touch you yeah yeah so I try and reconnect the two tracks with these big questions about humanity and about life I guess it was luck had had something to do with it but it it was very successful in the 20th century there are some historian also ask big question like an JG Wells how this kind of tradition shape you I mean influenced me the biggest influence on me I think was from Jared Diamond Jared Diamond uh he was a specialist in Birds yeah he was the one who came and kind of showed the historians look you can do these things to like looking at humans for a birds eye view from bird to bird view yeah so you have comparing Jared demon what's your advantage and disadvantage of your books their strength compared with me is that I don't really have any background in biology but if you just know biology if you just understand Evolution and you know everything there is to know about humans you can now explain human history I don't think that this can work because human history also has a very important ingredient of culture of ideas of stories of fictions and this is kind of my speciality the exploration understanding of fictions and mythologies and stories and their immense impact on human history and if you don't give enough importance to the stories to the fictions you will never understand something like the second world war or like the French Revolution or like the rise of Christianity there was no biological or geographical explanation so what's what's the what do you think the major flaw of your theory have you ever think about it of my theory yeah your I mean your perspective you try to explain the whole world the history but what's the major flaw in the process Well if I knew the major flow I would have corrected I there are definitely flows I do you have any kind of worry maybe I speak so much about the change that the the process but actually I don't understand very well do you have any concern there are many areas because your your tongue in the books is so confident so yeah there are many areas that I talk about and I have no firsthand experience I just rely on what the experts in the field say and I believe them and I have no ability to kind of verify for myself that what I'm saying is is is true I just I just believe them so it's it's again it's only secondhand knowledge I read articles and books about artificial intelligence and what are the principles behind the program behind the machine learning so uh I trust that they are right I hope that that they are not kind of you know making this colossal mistake and leading the entire world after them okay come welcome welcome welcome everybody maybe say something about your yourself you you from touch well I I am from a Dutch German family but I was born here nowadays I'm studying to become a rabbi conservative Rabbi how could one be a rabbi you have to study and you have to pass exams you compare with the priest for the Christian similar things or not similar I mean the role they played in the social yeah I think you know you are the spiritual leader of of the people and it's a very important job because you're working with people for us for our side the Jewish Education seems very interesting combination on one side it's a quite religious you stick some Everlasting truth on the other side the the Jewish people seems very open open to new technology new knowledge so how to explain the the combination of this kind of paradox you know if you if you read the talmud you can see in the talmud that they already were very much open-minded they had already broad knowledge they didn't say oh we only have to confine ourself to one knowledge which is the Jewish we have to understand everything because life is about everything is a lot about discussions open discussions we bring different ideas and oh you heard a story that came from another country how do we relate to that story is it relevant to us I think that in the Jewish philosophy and you have to listen to to everything
