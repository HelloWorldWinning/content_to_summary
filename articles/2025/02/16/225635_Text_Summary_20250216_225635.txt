How to pick stocks for short-term trading
Short-term trading is about catching fast price swings rather than holding onto stocks for long periods.

Here's what to focus on when making short-term stock picks:

1. Use technical analysis for timing
Instead of looking at a company's long-term financial health, short-term traders focus on price action and market sentiment. Tools like moving averages (e.g., 50-day, 200-day) help identify the direction of price trends, which are useful for spotting potential entry or exit points.

Moving averages. If a stock's price is above its moving average, it may signal an upward trend, while falling below could indicate a downward trend.
RSI (Relative Strength Index). RSI is a momentum indicator that ranges from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests a stock might be overbought (potential for a drop), while below 30 may indicate oversold conditions (potential for a rebound).
Bollinger bands. These help traders identify volatility and potential reversal points by showing when a stock is trading outside its typical price range.
2. Focus on catalysts
Catalysts such as earnings reports, product launches, or mergers can cause quick price movements. Traders often look for stocks with upcoming announcements or news that could drive sudden increases or drops in price. Monitoring news feeds and economic events is crucial for staying ahead of these shifts.

3. Ensure liquidity for quick trades
Liquidity matters when you need to enter and exit positions quickly without large price changes. In short-term trading, a stock with a healthy trading volume allows for smoother transactions and more reliable trade execution. Avoid stocks with large bid-ask spreads, as these can significantly eat into profits, especially in fast-moving markets.

4. Set stop-losses
Given the rapid price changes in short-term trading, setting stop-loss orders is essential to protect yourself from significant losses. A stop-loss order automatically sells a stock once it hits a predetermined price, helping you limit downside risks if the market moves against you.

How to pick stocks for day trading
Day trading focusses on capturing fast, often minute-by-minute price movements within a single trading day. To succeed in day trading, you must be nimble and rely on real-time data and volatility.

Most of what we mentioned about short-term trading matters here, too. But here are a few extra points you should consider when day trading:

1. Focus on high volatility
Volatility is crucial for day traders because it creates profit opportunities. Stocks that regularly experience price swings of 2-5% or more within a single day are prime candidates. You can use volatility scanners to identify such stocks, which are typically influenced by market sentiment, breaking news, or sudden events.

2. Use real-time data and news feeds
Day traders rely heavily on real-time price data and news updates. Pre-market and post-market scans are vital for spotting stocks that are likely to experience sharp price movements. Earnings reports, regulatory changes, or geopolitical news can all serve as triggers for major price changes throughout the day.

3. Select stocks with high volume
For day trading, the higher the volume, the better. You need stocks that trade millions of shares per day (at least 1 million) to ensure you can quickly move in and out of trades.

High volume provides liquidity but also reduces slippage, which is when the price of a stock changes between the time you place an order and when it gets executed. This helps you execute trades at or close to your desired price.

Avoid low-volume stocks, as they can cause price swings that may be harder to predict or take advantage of in a short timeframe.

4. Avoid holding positions overnight
Day traders close all their positions by the end of the trading day to avoid risks associated with holding stocks overnight. Unanticipated news after the market closes could lead to unpredictable price changes when the market reopens, creating potential losses.
