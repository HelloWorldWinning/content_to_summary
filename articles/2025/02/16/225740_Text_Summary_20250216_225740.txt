How to select stocks for swing trading
Swing trading is about benefiting from short- to medium-term price movements, typically holding stocks for a few days to a few weeks. This strategy seeks to catch the "swings" in stock prices (upward or downward) while avoiding long-term exposure to risks.

The principles of short-term trading apply here, too, but here are some tactics you should pay extra attention to when picking stocks in swing trading:

1. Look for trend reversals
Swing traders focus on identifying patterns that suggest a stock is about to change its price direction. Patterns like double tops, double bottoms, and head-and-shoulders formations are often signs of these reversals. These technical indicators help traders anticipate when a stock will move from a downtrend to an uptrend or vice versa.

2. Watch for support and resistance levels
Unlike day traders, swing traders pay close attention to key support and resistance levels, as these are the price points where stocks often reverse direction. By buying near support or selling near resistance, traders can enter or exit trades with a favourable risk-to-reward ratio.

3. Focus on price consolidation
Swing traders may benefit from price consolidation periods, where stocks move within a narrow range before making their next big move. Identifying stocks that are consolidating can help traders enter positions before a breakout or breakdown, maximising potential gains from the next price swing.

4. Timeframe alignment
Swing trading is unique in its balance between shorter and longer timeframes. Traders usually analyse both daily and weekly charts to ensure that their trades are aligned with broader market trends. This multi-timeframe approach ensures that swing traders can benefit from intermediate price movements while staying in line with the overall market direction.
