Description:
Okay, let's break down the text and summarize it:

**Summary:**

1.  **Challenging the "Hard Work = Results" Equation:**
    *   The text questions the common belief that effort automatically leads to success in areas like wealth, health, and knowledge.
    *   It points out that many people work hard without achieving the desired results.

2.  **The Importance of "用心" (Yòngxīn - Using Your Heart/Mindfulness/Conscience):**
    *   The text argues that "用心" (yòngxīn) is more crucial than simply "努力" (nǔlì - hard work).
    *   "用心" isn't something you consciously seek; it emerges when you are not actively trying.

3.  **Defining "用心" as "凭良心" (Píng liángxīn - Following Your Conscience):**
    *   The text equates "用心" with "凭良心," suggesting that genuine effort stems from acting according to one's conscience and inner moral compass.
    *   This conscientious action leads to persistence.

**Core Point:** True success comes not just from effort, but from acting with conscience and mindfulness (用心).

**Fundamental Point:** Genuine effort ("用心") arises from aligning one's actions with their conscience ("凭良心"), leading to meaningful and sustained progress.

**Overarching Framework:** This is a philosophical argument contrasting the perceived value of sheer effort versus the deeper importance of acting with conscience and mindfulness as the true driver of success.
