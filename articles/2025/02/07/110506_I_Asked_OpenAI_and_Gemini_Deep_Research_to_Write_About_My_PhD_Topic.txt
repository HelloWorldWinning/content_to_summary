Duration: 10:19

Description:
Here's a structured summary of the content:

**1. Introduction:**

*   OpenAI released "Deep Research," an AI agent capable of generating comprehensive reports using extended compute.
*   The speaker, a PhD graduate, tested the AI's ability to create a research review in their area of expertise: Black Hole Mass measurements.
*   He compared the AI's output to his own dissertation.

**2. Experiment Setup:**

*   The speaker provided Deep Research with a prompt to create a research review on the state of his field.
*   He clarified preferences regarding old references, theoretical depth, and citation style.
*   He recognized limitations on plot generation but expected table creation.

**3. Results & Observations (OpenAI's Deep Research):**

*   The AI spent 15 minutes researching and generating a report.
*   The speaker noted issues with formatting, citation accuracy, and a somewhat simplistic writing style reminiscent of a less-confident graduate student.
*   It missed several relevant publications in the field despite their open availability.
*   Formatting errors occurred, and plot generation failed.

**4. Gemini's Deep Research**

*   Also tested Gemini's deep research product, but found similar rudimentary results.
*   Also only cited about 10 sources.

**5. Overall Assessment & Limitations:**

*   The speaker corroborates OpenAI's self-acknowledged limitations: fact hallucination, incorrect inferences, difficulty distinguishing authoritative information, confidence calibration issues, and formatting errors.
*   Despite limitations, the speaker emphasizes the potential of AI agents to autonomously perform research tasks, freeing up human researchers for more creative thinking.
*   The speaker still sees the value in this type of AI autonomy because you can be off doing something while the AI is working.

**6. Excitement for the Future:**

*   Excitement is expressed for the progression of AI agents in research.
*   The speaker is anticipating future models for autonomous work.
*   The AI's limitations shouldn't downplay its potential.

**Core Point:** Current AI research agents like OpenAI's and Gemini's "Deep Research" show promise in automating literature reviews but still exhibit significant limitations in accuracy, comprehensiveness, and nuanced understanding.

**Fundamental Point:** Despite current shortcomings, AI-powered research assistants have the potential to revolutionize research workflows by automating time-consuming tasks, thus enabling researchers to focus on higher-level creative and analytical work.

**Overarching Framework:** Evaluation of AI research agent capabilities, focusing on practical application in a specialized research field, identification of current limitations, and anticipation of future improvements and impact.

Content:
open aai released deep research yesterday which is an AI agent that can create comprehensive reports by using extended test time compute and I was really interested in it because I think I do deep research in some aspect and I was also really impressed by the performance on the humanities last exam Benchmark you can see that open AI deep research more than doubles the performance of the 03 mini medium and high models almost triples the performance on open ai1 and so I think this is a really big step forward in terms of AI agents and giving AIS autonomy to do tasks and what I wanted to do is I wanted to see how well it could do in specifically the field of research that I did my PhD in there are very few things in this world that I would consider myself to be an expert in but considering I Lally wrote a dissertation on something I think that's something I can say I am somewhat of an expert in and I have my thesis here because I wanted to have it here to reference and sort of compare with what open ai's deep research model was going to do so the plan that I had for it was that I wanted to have it create a research review on the state of my field of research in graduate school so I was doing Black Hole Mass measurements with this very specific telescope I won't get really into to the scientific nitty-gritty I just wanted to give you some context as to what I wanted it to do and that I have some semblance of an idea of how it should respond and I gave it this prompt and then came back with some questions just for clarification in terms of if it wanted me to include these old references how deep of a theoretical discussion should go into the citation style and the table and plot unfortunately I didn't realize that I don't think it's able to create plots quite yet I think that's something that they said they'll give it to deep research later in terms of using python to create plots and I just don't think that it was quite ready for that so that was probably a that was too much of an ask to ask it to make a plot but the table is something it definitely could and did do and so I just told it my preferences and then it went off to think about this prompt and spent 15 minutes it's doing some research now I did take a video of this while it was going and I find this entertaining because I was taking a shower while this was going I literally just set the prompt in in motion here and then I just let it go it's kind of funny that this thing was just working while I was taking a shower and brushing my teeth in the morning which I think is kind of the huge Advantage this type of AI autonomy provides because you can be off doing something thing but you could still be productive because your agent is off and working so this is just the sources it's searching here you can see it still actively thinking and I just find it cool to see that these are all references that I'm very familiar with and that you know it's it's really it really seems like it is doing a thorough job of finding the proper sources so it did that for 15 minutes or so and I went ahead and I pulled out the text I wanted to look at it in a more clear way so uh you can see I made this table here which is really cool but I ended up putting it into a latch document so I could get a better reference as to how how much it actually wrote so this is what it looks like in latc it's not really well formatted so I apologize you can see here that the citations don't really show up they're just sort of double question marks here now I'm gonna be honest reading through this report I was maybe not the most impressed like if a human did this I would be like okay this needs a lot of work you can see here that there are just some sections that are just like one or two sentences there are some citations I believe that were not properly correct like this one for example this is actually my paper that it's referencing here this galaxy does not actually exhibit a central Co void but this one does so it seemed to get confused there and the writing while it's it's all technically correct like the physics is right it just reads maybe a bit simplistically and it it writes like a graduate stent who really just doesn't have the confidence quite yet in terms of what what they're talking about and I I can speak from experience that it's kind of similar to how I would used to write when I wasn't uh very confident in myself as a as a graduate student and it seems like it tried to make a plot but it couldn't so that's why there's this big gap here and overall the references that it's cited which aren't appearing here so let me go back down here the references it cited while these are all quality references I was surprised that it didn't site more because if you look at this table here it has only about 10 different measurements but just looking at this and knowing because I did this for you know 5 years I know for a fact it's missing a lot more measurements so compare that to the table I have at the end of my dissertation because I did compile all of the different measurements in the field over the years up until the point that I graduated so you can see that there is a lot more references than it properly cites so that seems to be some sort of weakness and I I don't know why it didn't site more because I I know a lot of these papers are available through archive for example as archive is the pre-print server so you don't have to pay money to go behind a pay wall or anything like that and so I was just a little bit surprised that it didn't it didn't find more of these sources than it ended up providing so you know I don't want to be too harsh on it I think the formatting and the maybe lack of of quality sources as well as just some of these small things right where there's this slight inaccuracies in in referencing the citations that kind of kind of make me think okay you know this is definitely the first version it's not in its final State and I think they even say that on the open AI website that it's not it's not perfect so the limitations here it says has limitations it can sometimes hallucinate facts and responses or make incorrect inferences though at a notably lower rate than existing chat gbt models according to internal evaluations it may struggle with distinguishing authoritative information from rumors and currently shows weakness in confidence calibration often failing to convey uncertainty accurately at launch there may be minor formatting errors and reports citations and task may take longer to KI off we expect all these issues to quickly improve with more usage and time so I can corroborate all of that just by looking at my own dissertation which took way longer than 15 minutes to to compile so I don't want to be too mean to deep research I still think it's a really cool thing that I was able to just you know set it off and I can go and take a shower and have it work while I was not at the computer so that's a really cool feature though again it's kind of used at your own risk and don't take everything it says as gospel one other thing I'd like to point out is that I didn't even know about this but Gemini also has deep research Gemini Advance 1. 5 Pro and apparently they've had it for over a month now I think and I just did not know that it existed and so I found that very amusing that it's also called Deep research like open AI deep rearch even though it was Gemini that came out with it first now I'm going to be honest I didn't look too deeply into deep research from Gemini I just gave it the same prompt and wanted it to create a report and if I'm going to be honest it's also fairly rudimentary I would say I don't think that it's as comprehensive as one would really want from a say graduate student who is making a literature review it again just cites 10 s es even though like I said before and in this table there's only like you know 10 Galaxies here even though when you compare it to for example my dissertation table it's clearly lacking in some sources so again it seems like Gemini deep research and open ey deep research still have a ways to go though it is still a very cool concept that you can just have ai agents doing this kind of work for you so that's basically it I don't have much else to say other than it's a really cool feature that these companies are cing out with agents that can autonomously do work for you obviously they're not perfect they have some flaws as I've mentioned in this video but these are the worst versions of these models and they'll just continue to get better so keep your eyes open for more models I'm excited to see as this technology progresses because it's going to be really awesome I think for so many different people to have agents doing kind of work in the background while you're off doing something else I think it really does free you up to have perhaps more creative thinking time to solve uh different kinds of problems that you might just be bogged down with having to do you know literature review on archive or on all these different research article websites and so this is a really really cool feature and I don't want the limitations to downplay the potential it has here though there is still work to be done so with that thank you for watching the video I hope you liked it I hope it was informative I hope it wasn't too overwhelming with my own research domain in physics but I just wanted to really see how well these models could do in a domain that I was very familiar with so with that thank you for watching I'll be back with more videos and I'll see you next time
