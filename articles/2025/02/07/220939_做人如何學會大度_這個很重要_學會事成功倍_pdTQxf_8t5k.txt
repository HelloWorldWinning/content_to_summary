Description:
Okay, let's break down this passage.

**1. Outlined Summary:**

*   **I. The Paradox of Claimed Generosity:**
    *   A. Anyone can claim to be generous ("My generosity is vast, believe me").
    *   B. Just stating it doesn't make it true ("Anyone can say 'I didn't kill'").
*   **II. Examining Real Generosity (A Person's Capacity):**
    *   A. The passage introduces a person (referred to as "Gangzi") described as having great capacity (大人之量).
    *   B. However, the person’s tolerance is conditional and selective.
*   **III. Selective Tolerance and Hypocrisy:**
    *   A. "Gangzi" doesn't tolerate being told he's wrong, exposing the limits of his supposed generosity.
    *   B. He only tolerates those he likes/agrees with, thus challenging the claim of having a great capacity.
*   **IV. Questioning the Nature of Capacity:**
    *   A. The speaker questions where "Gangzi's" generosity truly lies.
    *   B. It isn't the "capacity of a scholar" (文人之量), as that would tolerate diverse opinions.

**2. Core Point (One Sentence):**

Claiming to be generous is easy; true generosity is revealed by how one responds to dissent and differing opinions.

**3. Fundamental Point (One Sentence):**

Authentic character, including claimed virtues like generosity, is demonstrated through actions, especially in challenging situations.

**4. Overarching Framework:**

The content sets up a contrast between the *claim* of generosity and the *demonstration* of it. It questions the validity of self-proclaimed virtues, highlighting that true character is revealed through actions, specifically in how one handles criticism and disagreement.
