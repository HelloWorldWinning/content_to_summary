Content:
Aider is AI pair programming in your terminal
Aider lets you pair program with LLMs, to edit code in your local git repository. Start a new project or work with an existing code base. Aider works best with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, DeepSeek R1 & Chat V3, OpenAI o1, o3-mini & GPT-4o. Aider can connect to almost any LLM, including local models.


 

Getting started
If you already have python 3.8-3.13 installed, you can get started quickly like this:

python -m pip install aider-install
aider-install

# Change directory into your code base
cd /to/your/project

# Work with DeepSeek via DeepSeek's API
aider --model deepseek --api-key deepseek=your-key-goes-here

# Work with Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Anthropic's API
aider --model sonnet --api-key anthropic=your-key-goes-here

# Work with GPT-4o via OpenAI's API
aider --model gpt-4o --api-key openai=your-key-goes-here

# Work with Sonnet via OpenRouter's API
aider --model openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet --api-key openrouter=your-key-goes-here

# Work with DeepSeek via OpenRouter's API
aider --model openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat --api-key openrouter=your-key-goes-here
