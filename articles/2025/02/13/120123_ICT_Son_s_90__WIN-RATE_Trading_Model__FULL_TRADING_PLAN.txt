Description:
好的，这是您要求的总结：

1.  **核心结论：** ICT 的“儿子交易模型”是一个高胜率、低盈亏比的期货（尤其是纳斯达克100指数期货）日内交易策略，主要在“银弹时间窗口”（上午10-11点）操作。

2.  **总体框架：**
    *   **市场选择:** 主要关注纳斯达克100指数期货（E-mini NASDAQ 100 Futures），也适用于外汇的美元货币对。
    *   **时间框架:**
        *   高时间框架（15分钟或5分钟）识别流动性。
        *   低时间框架（5分钟、1分钟，甚至30秒）寻找入场点。
    *   **关键概念:**
        *   流动性猎取 (Runs on liquidity)
        *   市场结构突破 (Market structure break/shift)
        *   公平价值缺口 (Fair value gap - FVG)
        *   银弹时间窗口 (Silver Bullet window - 10:00-11:00 AM)
    *   **交易设置:**
        *   止损：12 个 “handles”（点数）。
        *   止盈：10 个 “handles”（点数）。
    *  **交易流程**
        1.  在较高时间框架（15分钟或5分钟）上寻找流动性被猎取。
        2.  切换到较低时间框架（5分钟或1分钟），等待市场结构突破。
        3.  在市场结构突破后，寻找公平价值缺口（FVG）作为入场点。
        4.  设置12个点的止损和10个点的止盈。

what is up guys welcome back to another video today we're going to be talking about an exciting new model this is ict's very own Sons trading model okay now let's get into the video because this one's going to be a good one I'm going to show you an in-depth full plan this is the only video you're going to need need to watch on his son's model okay I'm going to teach you it how he teaches it we've all learned it we all know it it's got a high strike rate he tried started Trading it last Thursday and he's had 100% win rate you could probably back test and have anywhere from 85 to 90 or more win rate with this okay so let's get into it we're going be looking at runs on liquidity from 15 or five minute and then we're going to look at a five one or even down to the 302 which is what he's using the 30 second to enter his stop loss is 12 handles and take profits 10 handles now why are we talking handles because you can use it in USD pairs of Eur USD uh GBP USD and the and Forex but the main asset that he's using is in Futures on top step is the E mini NASDAQ 100 Futures okay now he trades in the Silver Bullet window which is from 10 to 11 okay now we we can be looking from 9: 30 to 11 though and have that whole opening Kill Zone to use okay so we see here on the 15 minute let's look at liquidity here we we've taken some liquidity there on the 15 we have some nice equal lows down here for sells side liquidity okay so drop down to the five minute okay we've come up now buy here is sell side because this is pretty clean down here okay we've already taken out a lot of the sellers here in this whole range down and tapped up into this uh small five minute uh fair value Gap here which you can see if we drag it over okay we started to shift down so now I'm waiting for uh this high is taken okay this high is taken let's move forward here okay so if we see here this swing High here just in here boom boom see that swing High there we take that high okay boom okay so we take that high in here go down to the one minute of a nice fair value Gap in here we broke Market structure with this Wick down Okay so let's take an entry here short in in that Gap Oh wrong one short in here okay 12 handles and we're and ICT says the sun only goes for 10 okay this is a beginner model you're going to be negative RR but it has a really high strike rate okay so we're already down and within two candles boom you've already hit your takeprofit okay now I mean this is it let's see if we go down to the 302n it's the same thing nice break to the downside we have this per value Gap we don't enter we have another one break Market structure let's see if we get cool so we break structure again here we leave this for a value Gap see if it takes you out there it does but again one there no return back but soon as we took this F minute High there right this was that FIV minute high on the one minute fa value got entry 12 handle stop 10 point take profit now we look down where was the cell side right move this over we could have targeted this low here right boom boom boom comes down and then we have sell side down here see if we take that out oh let me use the boom sell aside taken okay now ICT himself says this is not a complete model okay but he's had huge huge win rate with this okay now the way I trade we'll just go through this real quick the way I trade is off the five minute okay my favorite entry is off to five minute I believe this is where I entered off this five minute okay Silver Bullet style in this Gap okay see we take the FIB here and we're going to get a 62 retracement and then this is where we take our short from right in here okay I like to have a 10 point stop and then I will shoot for one to two or one to three in this case if we look on the one hour today we had this nice sell side here and we had some nice sell side down here okay we go back to the five minute so targeting this low down here would be a nice one to five okay uh let me see if I can log in here real [Music] quick we show turn on the executions here if it shows them no okay well if we look in the Discord here uh I don't think I posted them today main chat I posted them in Market militia right here took this cell was going to take it to sell side but got out early okay um so took the sell off to five minute I really like five minutes inside of the the uh Silver Bullet
