Content:
 Under what conditions angels adopt on their earth? Tesla, I have tenithm, keep good records vigilant. Journalist, I will document all your words dear Mr. Tesla. Tesla, the first requirement is a high awareness of its mission and the work to be done. It must, if only dimly, exist in the early days. Let us not be falsely modest. Oak knows that it is oak tree, a bush beside him being a bush. When I was twelve, I had been sure I will get to Niagara Falls. For most of my discoveries I knew in my childhood that I would achieve them. Although not entirely apparent, the second condition to adapt is determination. All that I might, I finished. Journalist, what is the third condition of adjustment Mr. Tesla energies in labor? Therefore purification of the many effects and needs that man has. I have not lost anything but just gained. So I enjoyed every day and night. Right down, Nikola Tesla was a very happy man. The fourth requirement is to adjust the physical assembly with work. Journalist, what do you mean Mr. Tesla? Tesla, first the maintenance of the assembly. Man's body is a perfect machine. I know my circuit and what's good for him. Food, what nearly all people eat. To me is harmful and dangerous. Sometimes I visualize that chefs in the world are all in conspiracy against me. Touch my hand. Journalist, it was cold. Tesla, yes. Blood stream can be controlled and many processes in and around us. Why are you frightened young men? Journalist. It's a story that Mark Twain wrote a mysterious stranger. That wonderful book of Satan, inspired by you. Tesla. The word Lucifer is more charming. Mr. Twain likes a joke. As a child I was healed once by reading his books. When we met here and I told him about, he was so touched that he cried. We became friends and often came to my lab. Once he requested to show him a machine that vibration provokes a feeling of bliss. It was one of those inventions for entertainment. What I sometimes like to do, I warned Mr. Twain as not to remain under these vibrations. He did not listen and stayed longer. It ended up by being like a rocket holding his pants, darted into a certain room. It was diabolically funny, but I kept the seriousness. But to adjust the physical circuit in addition to food, dream is very important. From a long and exhausting work which required superhuman effort. After one hour of sleep, I'd be fully recovered. I gained the ability to fell asleep and wake up in a time which I have designated. If I do something, what I do not understand, I force myself to think about it in my dream. And thus find a solution. The fifth condition of adjustment is memory. Perhaps in the most people, the brain is keeper of knowledge about the world and the knowledge gained through the life. My brain is engaged in more important moments. This is all around us. It should only be consumed. Everything we once saw, hear, read and learn accompanies us in the form of light particles. To me these particles are the obedient and faithful. What is Fost, my favorite book? I learned in my heart in German as a student and now it can all recite. I held my inventions for years in my head. And only then I realized them. Journalist. You often mention the power of visualization. Tesla. I might have to thank visualization for all that I have invented. The events in my life and my inventions are real in front of my eyes. Visible as each occurrence or the item. In my youth, I was frightened of not knowing what it is. But later I learned to use this power as an exceptional talent and gift. I nurtured it and jealously guarded. I also made corrections by visualization on most of my inventions and finished them that way. By visualization I mentally solve complex mathematical equations. For that gift I have, I receive high rank llama in Tibet. My eyesight and hearing are perfect and dare to say stronger than other people. I hear the thunder of 150 miles away and I see colors in the sky that others cannot see. This enlargement of vision and hearing as a child. Later I consciously developed. Journalist. In youth, you have several times been seriously ill. Is it a disease and a requirement to adapt? Tesla. Yes. It is often the result of lack of exhaustion or vital force from toxins that have accumulated. It is necessary that man suffers from time to time. The source of most disease is in the spirit. Therefore the spirit can cure most of the diseases. As a student I got sick of cholera, which raged in the region of Laika. I was cured because my father finally allowed me to study technology, which was my life. Illusion for me was not a disease, but the mind's ability to penetrate beyond the three dimensions of earth. I had them all my life and have received them as all other phenomena around us. Once in childhood I was walking along the river with my uncle and said, from the water will appear the trout. I'll throw a stone and it is cut. That's what happened. Frightened and amazed, his uncle cried. He was educated and spoke in Latin. I was in Paris when I saw my mother's death. In the sky, full of delight and music floated our wonderful creatures. One of them had a mother's character who was looking at me with infinite love. As the vision disappeared, I knew that my mother died. Journalist What is the seventh adjustment, Mr. Tesla? Tesla. The knowledge of how the mental and vital energy transformed into what we want and achieved control over all feelings. In this call it Kundalini yoga, this knowledge can be learned. For what they need many years or is acquired by birth, the most of them are required by birth. They are in the closest connection with a sexual energy that is after the most widespread in the universe. The woman is the biggest thief of that energy and thus the spiritual power. I've always knew that and was alerted. Of myself, I created what I wanted. A thoughtful and spiritual machine. Journalist And the ninth adjustment, Mr. Tesla? Do everything that any day, any moment, if possible. Not to forget who we are and why we are here on earth. Extraordinary people who are struggling with illness, privation or the society which hurts them with its stupidity. This understanding, persecution and other problems which the country is full of, a swamps with insects, leaves behind unclaimed until the end of the work. There are many fallen angels on earth. Journalist What is the tenth adaptation? Tesla It is most important. Write that Mr. Tesla played. He played the whole of his life and enjoyed it. Journalist Mr. Tesla Whether it relates to your findings and your work, is this a game? Tesla Yes dear boy. I have so loved to play with electricity. I also cringe when I hear about the one also the Greek who stole fire. A terrible story about stubbing an eagles peck at his liver. Did Zeus not have enough lightning and thunder? And was damaged for one favor? There is some misunderstanding. Meaning are the most beautiful toys that can be found. Do not forget that in your text stand out. Nicole Tesla was the first man who discovered lightning. Journalist Mr. Tesla You are just talking about angels and their adaptation to this earth. Tesla Am I? This is the same. You could write this. He dared to take upon himself. The prerogatives of injury, Zeus and Peron. Imagine one of these gods in a black evening suit with the bull and wearing white gun gloves.
