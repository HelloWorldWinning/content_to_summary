all right let's dive deep into AI today we're going to be looking at a company called Deep seek they're really Making Waves even among the Giants like Google and meta yeah with a huge breakthrough in training those digital brain you know large language models LMS llms yeah what's Wild is just how they did it yeah they managed to train a massive llm called mixture of experts and it's got a mindboggling 671 billion parameters it's like a network with 671 billion connections all working together it's incredible right and they did all this in just two months which is 10 times faster than what companies like meta have been able to achieve Tom's Hardware has been all over this yeah and they're saying deep se's got this really unconventional approach to programming their Hardware specifically those powerful Nvidia h800 gpus yeah instead of using Ceda which is like the go-to for programming these gpus deep sequent with something called PTX PTX I haven't heard of that before most people haven't it stands for parallel thread execution it's basically talking to the gpus on a much lower level almost like you're speaking directly to the hardware itself so it's like choosing to speak this super efficient language M but it takes way more expertise to do it exactly and that's the thing with dsek they weren't going for the easy route they wanted to squeeze every ounce of performance out of those gpus even if it meant mastering this really difficult thing PTX I can't imagine it was just a matter of swapping a few lines of code what kind of work went into this they really dug deep the article even mentions they reconfigured the h800 gpus they dedicated specific parts of them for server to server communication think of it like making dedicated Lanes in the GPU to handle all the data flow way more efficiently so they redesigned how the traffic flows within the GPU itself yeah that's a great way to put it and on top of that they're using these Advanced pipeline algorithms which are all about breaking down that huge task of training the AI into smaller more manageable pieces so they could process things simultaneously and speed up that whole training process so it's like they took a high Performance Engine and meticulously tuned each part for max speed and that kind of optimization takes serious technical expertise it's not just about understanding the software but the hardware architecture down to the nuts and bolts it's no wonder this is shaking things up in the tech world what's been the reaction like from other companies it's been a mix of shock and some concern especially from the big players investors are paying attention that's for sure nvidia's stock took a hit which says a lot so all this technical stuff why should the average person care about what deep seeks doing well imagine a world where making Advanced AI doesn't need those massive server farms and huge budgets what deep seeks done with this efficiency it could open up things for smaller companies and researchers who couldn't compete before so instead of a few big companies calling all the shots with AI we could see more variety and innovation coming from all sorts of places exactly it could really democratize AI development and lead to all these new applications and solutions that benefit everyone of course some people are skeptical they wonder if this will actually reduce the need for all this high-end Hardware or if it'll just lead to even more demand for powerful systems that's a really good point there's definitely a lot to unpack here so let's keep digging into the technical side of deep seeks breakthrough this whole PTX approach seems to be the key what makes it so powerful right and why isn't everybody using it well think of it this way Ceda is like driving and automatic it's convenient and gets you where you're going but you don't really have much control over how the engine performs okay I get that so where does PTX fit in PTX is like driving a manual you got to shift gears yourself but you can fine-tune everything the engine does getting the most power and efficiency out of it so deep seek basically ditched the automatic comfort of Cuda for the raw power of PTX they went full manual exactly and remember how they reconfigured those Nvidia h800 gpus that shows their deep understanding of Hardware right those dedicated Lanes they created within the GPU for server to server communication it's like optimizing the traffic flow inside the hardware itself exactly it frees up other parts of the GPU to just focus on the AI training calculations like they made an express lane for data so the rest of the traffic flows smoothly without getting jammed up that's really smart it's not just about writing code that's efficient it's about making the whole system work perfectly from the software down to the hardware itself and that's what sets deep seek apart they see the whole picture of AI development it's not just about the algorithms it's about the whole ecosystem working together so what's next for deep seek will they keep pushing the limits of PTX programming that's the big question they've shown everyone what's possible but staying at this level of optimization is tough it takes a lot of talent and the hardware is always changing that reminds me of something you said earlier some people are worried this could lead to even more demand for powerful hardware and it's valid worry if deep seek can do this with what we have now imagine what they could do with the next generation of gpus it could be like an arms race for processing power with everyone trying to outdo each other that makes me wonder about the future of AI development will we see other companies following deep seeks lead or will they just focus on building even more powerful Hardware to stay ahead it's a tough choice deep seek success might inspire a new wave of innovation companies focusing on optimizing software and existing Hardware to get those amazing results but at the same time who wouldn't want more power right it's tempting to just keep building bigger and faster machines even if it means sticking with more traditional programming methods and that's what's so interesting about all of this it's like a Crossroads for AI development we can choose between two paths elegance and efficiency like deep seek or chasing after raw power it's like a philosophical debate about progress do we do more with less or keep pushing the limits of what's possible deep seek is definitely thrown a wrench of the gears and it's a wrench that could change everything it'll be fascinating to see how the industry reacts to this challenge it definitely feels like we're at a turning point deep seek shown us that there's another way to do AI development one that prioritizes efficiency and really understanding things deeply over just throwing more Hardware at a problem it's refreshing to see it'll be interesting to see if anyone else can do what they've done after all their team has this rare mix of skills and they aren't afraid to dive into the details of both hardware and software speaking of details let's get back to PTX for a minute we talk about how powerful and complex it is yeah but for those of us who aren't you know programming whizzes can you explain why it's so hard to work with imagine trying to build a house but you have to place each Brick by hand instead of using walls or pre-made sections that's kind of what PTX is like it gives you total control but you need to know exactly how everything works at the most basic level so no room for mistakes one wrong brick one wrong line of code and the whole thing falls apart exactly it's not easy you need a level of precision and attention to detail that most programmers just don't have the time or the skills for which makes what D seek did even more amazing not only did they Master this crazy complex language but they used it to optimize a piece of Hardware that was already Cutting Edge it's a real Testament to their engineering talent and it sets a new standard for the whole industry they've proven that there's so much more to discover even with technology ology we thought we knew inside and out it makes you wonder what other breakthroughs are out there if we're willing to go beyond the easy way of doing things absolutely and that's the real lesson from Deep seek story Innovation can come from anywhere from those who are willing to question things and explore new territory it's pretty inspiring and it definitely gives us a lot to think about what does this mean for the future of AI will we see a shift towards more efficient approaches like deep seeks or will the race for more and more processing power just keep going it's hard to say but deep seek has shaken things up for sure they've shown us that there's a different way to do things in AI one that emphasizes doing things well and efficiently that's a powerful message for the whole industry so for anyone listening who's into AI keep an eye on deep seek they're accompany to watch and their story isn't over yet and who knows maybe their work will inspire a new generation of AI developers to think differently to challenge what they know and to push the limits of what's possible that's great way to wrap things up thanks for joining us for this deep dive we hope you learned something new and maybe you're even feeling a little inspired to learn more about AI until next time keep learning keep questioning and keep diving deep
