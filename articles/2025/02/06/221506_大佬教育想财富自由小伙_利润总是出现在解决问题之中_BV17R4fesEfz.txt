 Excuse me sir, question for you. Have you ever been broke before? Could I interview you real quick? What's this for? I started the channel on Austin, I grew to 8 million followers, I interviewed business in Utah. I guess what line of business are you in? Real estate, what type of real estate? What type of real estate? What type of real estate? Did you buy it to anyone? He bought it. He bought it. How long have you been buying real estate? 35 years. There's a big misconception that you have to have a ton of money to start creating wealth in real estate. No. It starts small. What was the most amount of money that you made this in your year? Not one year, but one deal. When a $6 million investment made like $40 million. As a millionaire, what's the best financial advice that you ever received throughout your career? One lesson about money a mentor taught you that always stuck with you. Be cautious because someone's selling something. They get rid of a problem. You have to find out what the problem is. Every single deal, they're selling. Remember, they're selling their problem to you. But what is the lesson about money that banks don't want people to know? The banks don't want people to know. You never tell the bank everything. The banks ask me for my financial statement. I always leave shit out. Just tell me what they want to hear. How are you now? I'm old. I'm 67. I'm 22 though, so you got 48. You got 45 years old. My kids are 10 years old though. Who's generating works harder years of mine? Mine. No question about it. He's kidding. You're 22 years old. You know, you want, you want, you want. Do you think you worked harder than me when you were mine? Hell yeah. I disagree with him. I work a lot. When I was 22 years old, I had two jewelry stores. I was hustling on the streets selling jewelry, traveling, going to Italy to buy this shit, coming back. And I would be dinner on a shoe street.
