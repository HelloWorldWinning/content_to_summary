Description:
The core point is that dealing with a demanding and seemingly unappreciative woman requires understanding her insecurities and gradually increasing her tolerance rather than simply cutting off contact.

The overarching framework involves identifying the woman's behavior as stemming from insecurity and a need for control, and then strategically responding by holding the power and slowly increasing her tolerance for unmet demands.

 You've spent a lot of money on her. One second you're laughing, the next, a misunderstanding, and all the good feelings are gone because you didn't meet her demands right away. She pressures you, causes arguments, even talks about breaking up. It's like your efforts never existed. Even if you quit bad habits or change your temper, she might not come back. Such women are usually self-centered. Their actions are based on their own experience. They love the feeling, more than they love you. This comes from a huge need for security. She needs to confirm and approve everything. Anything against her wishes, or anything you hide from her, is a challenge to her limits. With such a woman, cutting off contact won't make her value. You need to hold the chips and gradually increase her tolerance. If you're in this situation now, check out my book Mastering Love. It has examples of how to make a woman go from cold to proactive.
