Description:
**Summary:**

1.  **Core Idea:**
    *   The speaker advocates for documenting decision-making principles.
    *   Principles are like recipes for making decisions, outlining criteria and process.
    *   This helps clarify thinking, improve communication, and address recurring situations.

2.  **Benefits of Documenting Principles:**
    *   Clarity: Forces reflection, leading to clearer understanding of decisions.
    *   Consistency: Provides a framework for handling similar situations repeatedly.
    *   Communication: Facilitates better explanation and justification of decisions.
    *   Debatability: Allows for constructive discussion and refinement of principles.

3.  **Process:**
    *   Reflect on a decision after it's made or at the time.
    *   Write down the principles that guided the decision.
    *   Use these principles as a guide for future similar decisions.

4.  **Core Point:** Documenting decision-making principles improves clarity, consistency, and communication in addressing recurring situations.

5.  **Fundamental Point:** The key to effective decision-making is to abstract lessons into repeatable principles, rather than treating each event as unique.

6.  **Overarching Framework:** The content presents a cycle of action-reflection-documentation, where actions (decisions) are followed by reflective documentation to create guiding principles for future actions.

Content:
 I urge people to do that. There are many excellent decision makers, and I just wish that they wrote down their principles. I find that almost everything happens over and over again. After I make the decision usually, or right at the time, if I pause and reflect and I write my principle down, in other words, principle is sort of a recipe. What would I use to, how would I make that decision? And what are the criteria around it? I find that I make it much more clear, it becomes clear, and it applies to the next thing that comes along. It'll be that way, because everything happens over and over and over again. And I think people make the mistake of looking at just the one, like it's the first one, I don't know, they have the first problem of this sort of the first child, or whatever it is, and this has been happening plenty of time. And so if you have the principles, I found that that helped me think more clearly about it, and it helped me communicate better, like why? And so over the years, over the last 30 years or so, that's what I've done. I did it originally to communicate very well with people I work with. I set up my company and it was very important to have good communication. And then we could debate the principles, and so that's the process.
