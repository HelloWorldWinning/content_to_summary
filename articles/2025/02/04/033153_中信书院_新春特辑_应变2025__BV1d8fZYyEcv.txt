 I urge people to do that. There are many excellent decision makers, and I just wish that they wrote down their principles. I find that almost everything happens over and over again. After I make the decision usually, or right at the time, if I pause and reflect and I write my principle down, in other words, principle is sort of a recipe. What would I use to, how would I make that decision? And what are the criteria around it? I find that I make it much more clear, it becomes clear, and it applies to the next thing that comes along. It'll be that way, because everything happens over and over and over again. And I think people make the mistake of looking at just the one, like it's the first one, I don't know, they have the first problem of this sort of the first child, or whatever it is, and this has been happening plenty of time. And so if you have the principles, I found that that helped me think more clearly about it, and it helped me communicate better, like why? And so over the years, over the last 30 years or so, that's what I've done. I did it originally to communicate very well with people I work with. I set up my company and it was very important to have good communication. And then we could debate the principles, and so that's the process.
