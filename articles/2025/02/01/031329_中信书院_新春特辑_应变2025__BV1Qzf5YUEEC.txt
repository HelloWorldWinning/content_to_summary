Content:
 Well, by far the best investment you can make is in yourself. I mean, for example, communication skills. I tell those students that they're going to graduate schools and business and they're going all the least complicated formulas, all that. If they just learn to communicate better, both in writing and in person, they increase their value at least 50%. No, I mean, if you can't communicate somebody, it's like winking in a girl in the dark. Nothing happens, you know, basically. And you have to be able to get bored with your ideas. And that's a problem. It's really easy. I did it myself with a Dale Carnegie, of course. But it's just hugely important. And if you invest in yourself, nobody can take it away from you. The second thing, which I'll get a certain criticism for not living it, but I do tell those students, you know, that if I gave you a car and it'd be the only car you'd get the rest of your life, you'd take care of it like you can't believe it. Any scratch would fix that moment. You'd be the owner's manually. You'd keep it garage, the only thing. You'd get exactly one mind, one body in this work, and you can't start taking care of it when you're 50. You might not be able to rush it out if you haven't done anything. So you should really secure the two. Just remember that you just got one mind. But they could get through life with them. What about life advice? Well, life advice is the most important thing. Aside from things I've talked about already, is just really who you associate with. You want to associate with people who are better than you are. I mean, basically you'll go in the direction of the people you associate with them. And you want to have the right heroes. You want people... If you want to emulate somebody, you better pick very carefully who you want to emulate. And when... Obviously, you can't pick your parents. They're going to have an arms influence on you. But you don't get a choice on that. But you get choices as you go down the line. And who you... Who you admire, who you want to copy, and the most important. For most people, in terms of that decision, there's files. Also important to a partner in business with partner in life is the most important. You'll want to pick a spouse that's better than you are. And then here she... And you'll hope they don't figure it out too fast.
