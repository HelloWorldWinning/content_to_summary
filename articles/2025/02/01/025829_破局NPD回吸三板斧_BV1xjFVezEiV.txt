**Outline and Summary:**

1.  **Introduction to NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder) Individuals:**
    *   NPD individuals are described as energy vampires, draining their victims' energy and soul.
    *   They tend to appear and disappear from their victims' lives, creating a cycle of suffering.

2.  **Three Stages of NPD Manipulation (The "Three Blades" or Three-Pronged Approach):**
    *   **First Blade: Persist and Lure:**
        *   After a breakup, they maintain a passive presence on social media, subtly hinting at their past relationship.
        *   They might send vague, sentimental messages or even call and then claim it was a mistake, to evoke nostalgia.
        *   The goal is to lure the victim back into their control by triggering their feelings and memories.
    *   **Second Blade: Pseudo-Apology and Acting the Victim:**
        *   They will present themselves as if the old, good version of themselves has returned.
        *    They may feign remorse and admit to minor mistakes to quickly win back their victim.
        *    They might also use extreme behavior like self-harm to garner sympathy and control.
    *   **Third Blade: Rage and Threat:**
        *   When their manipulation fails, they will switch to anger and threats.
        *    They might harass the victim at home or work.
        *    They might use emotional blackmail, such as threatening suicide to manipulate the victim into submission.

3.  **NPD Tactics and Motives:**
    *   NPD individuals lack genuine self-esteem and have no bottom lines.
    *   They prioritize control and dominance in relationships.
    *   Their actions are not due to love or longing but to maintain power and have a sense of ownership.
    *   They seek to dictate the dynamics of the relationship, to stay in the 'king's chair.
    *   Their behaviors are not about deep desire but about maintaining the role of being the ultimate decision maker.
    *   They use a mix-and-match strategy in the three prongs, not always sequentially.

4.  **Hoovering and Beyond Reconciliation:**
    *   Hoovering is not about wanting to reconnect in a genuine way but is part of a bigger process of maintaining control.
    *    It can include all sorts of interactions, from attacks and insults to emotional manipulation.
    *   Even if the victim has become aware or has rejected them, NPDs might try to re-engage when they feel they are losing control, have a win, or simply to remind the victim of their presence.

5.  **The Nature of Hoovering:**
    *   Hoovering is a test of the victim's emotional boundaries.
    *   If the victim responds, the cycle will repeat.
    *   Hoovering is a dangerous cycle which could lead to immense suffering for the victim.

6.  **Seeking Help:**
    *   If you find yourself in such a relationship, seek professional help.
    *   It’s crucial to get support to navigate through this complex relationship and emotional stress.

**Core Point:**
NPD individuals manipulate their victims using a consistent cycle of engagement, pseudo-apologies, and threats, aiming to maintain control and ownership of the relationship dynamic, rather than to achieve genuine reconnection or change.

**Fundamental Point:**
The interactions with NPD individuals are not about mutual connection, but rather about power dynamics where the NPD person seeks to always dominate and maintain their control over their victims.

**Overarching Framework:**
The overarching framework is a three-pronged cyclical process of NPD manipulation, characterized by (1) *Persistent Luring*, (2) *False Promises and Acting the Victim*, and (3) *Violent Outbursts and Threats*, all aimed at maintaining absolute control over the victim and ensuring their emotional dependence on the NPD individual.
