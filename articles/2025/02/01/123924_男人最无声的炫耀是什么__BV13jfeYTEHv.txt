Description:
### Summary:

**I. Background of the Family's Hardship:**
   * A family in a rural area faced a sudden crisis when their house collapsed, leaving the grandmother and two children (11 and 9 years old) in a very difficult situation.
   * Both parents were working away from home and their absence coupled with the home disaster, left the children with no direct support.
   * They suffered further hardship from their relatives who took their meager belongings and compensation money.
   * The children continue school but the family lacks proper furniture and financial resources.

**II. Initial Encounter and Reactions:**
   * The narrator and their leader visited the family as part of a work assignment.
   * The narrator felt sympathy but was somewhat numb to the prevalent hardships of the time, viewing it as a common situation.
   * The children were quiet, reserved, and avoided eye contact. The leader showed restraint and did not probe into their situation further.

**III. Leader’s Silent Support and Continued Assistance:**
   * Secretly, the leader started providing monthly financial assistance to the children through the village chief, using the guise of “work wages”.
   * The leader kept in regular contact with the school and village to monitor the children's progress, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the children's dignity by keeping the help anonymous.
   * They have provided this support for 6 years, revealing a quiet kindness and dedication.

**IV. The Children’s Success and Gratitude:**
    *  The elder brother was not successful in university, but went to work, learned skills, and eventually started a successful company.
    *  The younger sister successfully graduated from university, with the continued support of the leader.
    * The brother actively searched for his benefactor and when they finally met, he tried to show his gratitude, with the leader's kind refusal.
    * The leader’s humble behavior and the brother's determined gratitude form a very powerful moment of human connection.

**V. The Narrator’s Realization:**
    * The narrator was surprised by the leader’s silent commitment and personal sacrifice, which contrasted starkly with the leader's everyday frugal habits.
    * This revealed the depth of the leader’s character and provided a lesson about the true nature of silent generosity.

**Core Point:** The leader's quiet, consistent act of kindness transforms the lives of two struggling children, creating a narrative of hope and redemption.

**Fundamental Point:** True generosity is not about grand gestures but about sustained, quiet actions motivated by genuine care and devoid of the need for external recognition.

**Overarching Framework:** The narrative is centered around a leader's hidden act of consistent and selfless giving that dramatically changes the life trajectory of a struggling family, which leads to a story of gratitude and personal growth. It showcases how discreet support can lead to profound and transformative changes.
