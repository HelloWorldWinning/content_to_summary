project called osme PDF this isn't just another PDF tool it's a command line utility that adds a searchable text layer to your scanned PDF files which makes them much more useful what makes osme PDF unique well think about all those scan documents you have that are essentially just images you can't copy text you can't search through them they are a pain to work with osir PDF solves that problem it uses the TCT OCR engine to recognize text in over 100 languages but it's not just about recognizing text it's about doing it right it places the OCR text accurately below the image so you can easily copy and paste text plus it keeps the original resolution of your images unlike many other OCR tools osir PDF is designed to produce valid PD pdf/a files which is a standard for long-term storage it can also discute crooked Pages optimize the images for smaller file size and even handle multiple languages in the same document it also distributes the work across multiple CPU cores so it can handle large files with thousands of pages quickly it is Battle tested on millions of PDFs also this is a command line tool which means you can easily automated and it can be used across different operating systems Linux Mac OS windows and free BSD you can even use it with Docker if you've been looking for a free powerful and reliable way to make your scanned PDF searchable osir May PDF is

diving into an exciting open source project called you which in Chinese means both music and happiness if you find the name hard to pronounce you can simply call it yeah you is not just another music generation tool it's a groundbreaking series of Open Source Foundation models designed for transforming lyrics into full songs it's similar to soo. a but is completely open what makes you unique well you is capable of generating a complete song lasting several minutes which includes both a catchy Vocal Track and an accompaniment track it's designed to model diverse genres languages and vocal techniques it also supports multiple languages including English Mandarin Chinese Cantonese Japanese and Korean you offers two main modes cot Chain of Thought and ICL in context learning the ICL mode allows you to prompt the model with a reference song enabling it to generate new songs in a similar style this includes voice cloning and music style transfer the Dual track ICL mode which uses both vocal and instrumental tracks generally provides the best results you is licensed under the Apache 2. 0 license encouraging artists and content creators to use the model's outputs in their own Works including commercial projects as long as they credit the model the project emphasizes the importance of ensuring that works derived from you do not plagiarize or infringe on existing material the team recommends labeling AI generated Works to maintain transparency the models require significant GPU memory especially for full song generation for example generating 30 seconds of audio on an h800 GPU takes 150 seconds while it takes about 360 seconds on an RTX 490 GPU if you are looking for an open source music generation model you is worth checking out project number four open AI realtime agents demonstrating Advanced agentic patterns we're exploring an exciting open source project from open AI called openi realtime agents this project is a demonstration of more advanced agentic patterns built on top of the real-time API what makes open ey realtime agents unique this project demonstrates several key Concepts in Building multi-agent Systems first it shows how to implement sequential agent handoffs according to a defined agent graph drawing inspiration from open AI swarm this means that you can create a series of agents that pass control to each other based on a defined workflow the project also demonstrates background escalation to more intelligent models like 01 mini for highstakes decisions this allows you to use more powerful models when needed for example when an agent needs to make an important decision additionally it shows how to prompt models to follow a state machine for tasks such as accurately collecting names and phone numbers with character bych character confirmation to authenticate a user the project provides several examples to help you understand these Concepts the simple example shows how to set up a basic agent interaction where One agent greets the user and then transfers them to another agent to write a Hu the front desk authentication example guides the user through an authentication flow confirming each value character by character and then transfers to another agent the customer service retail example demonstrates an authentication flow reads A long offer from a script and then walks through a complex return flow using an 01 Mini model to determine eligibility the project is built as a next. js typescript app and you can easily set it up by installing dependencies adding your open AI API key and starting the server you can then select agent scenarios and switch between agents in the UI if you are interested in prototyping your own multi-agent real-time voice app this project is a great starting point project number five ingu AI powered platform integration via reverse engineering we're diving into a fascinating open source project called inaru inaru is an AI agent designed to build Integrations by reverse engineering the internal apis of different platforms what makes Inu unique well Inu takes a novel approach to integration instead of relying on official apis it analyzes the network requests your browser makes when you interact with a platform you start by using the included creatore Harpy tool to capture these requests in AAR file along with cookies and write a short prompt describing your action then the ingu agent takes over it identifies the key request needed to perform your action and then Works backwards to identify any other requests it depends on for example if you want to download a utility bill integer figures out which requests are needed to get the account and user IDs and then the final download request it then generates a dependency graph of these requests this graph is then converted into runnable python code that hits the the platform's internal endpoints to perform the desired action inaru can also handle cases where the request depends on Dynamic Parts like account or user IDs by identifying the requests that provide these values and adding them to the dependency graph intego can handle platforms that use two-factor authentication 2fa as long as you complete the 2fa process and obtain the cookie slof tokens SL session tokens after 2 FAA inteiro can also handle input variables for example if you want to specify the year of a document you want to download you can run anduru through the command line and even with a Jupiter notebook this project is a great tool if you want to automate tasks on a platform where there is no public API available project number
