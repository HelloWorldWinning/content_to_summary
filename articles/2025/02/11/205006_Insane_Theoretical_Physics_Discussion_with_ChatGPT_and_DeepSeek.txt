Duration: 4:59

Description:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the content, fulfilling all requirements:

**1. Outline and Structured Summary:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   The speaker is impressed by the capabilities of AI models (ChatGPT and DeepSeek) in discussing theoretical physics.
    *   The context is Maxwell's equations and their modification under the assumption of a variable speed of light (VSL).

*   **Variable Speed of Light (VSL) Context:**
    *   Einstein proposed VSL in 1911 as a way to formulate general relativity.
    *   VSL presents a challenge to the standard formulation of Maxwell's equations.

*   **ChatGPT's Approach:**
    *   The speaker poses the problem of modifying Maxwell's equations for VSL to ChatGPT.
    *   ChatGPT (after 14 seconds) correctly identifies the space and time dependence of the speed of light (c), electric permittivity (ε₀), and magnetic permeability (μ₀).
    *   ChatGPT proposes a solution by correctly applying vector analysis and derivatives.
    *  ChatGPT adds the view of metric.

*   **DeepSeek's Approach:**
    *   The same problem is posed to DeepSeek.
    *   DeepSeek (after 148 seconds) takes a more comprehensive approach, considering various perspectives and possibilities.
    *   DeepSeek proposes a solution that introduces an extra term dependent on the gradient of c (∇c) and the time derivative of c (∂c/∂t). This avoids directly modifying ε₀ and μ₀.

*   **Comparison and Conclusion:**
    *   The speaker prefers DeepSeek's solution for its deeper reasoning and approach of modifying the equations with an additional term.
    *   The speaker is impressed by the thinking process of both models.
    *   The speaker anticipates significant future discussions in theoretical physics with AI models.
    *   The speaker indicates they are interested to do further research and invite audiences to join.

**2. Core Point (One Sentence):**

AI models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek demonstrate impressive capabilities in addressing complex theoretical physics problems, such as modifying Maxwell's equations for a variable speed of light, with DeepSeek offering a particularly insightful solution.

**3. Overarching Framework:**

The content presents a **Problem-Solution-Comparison** framework:

1.  **Problem:** How to modify Maxwell's equations to accommodate a variable speed of light.
2.  **Solutions:** Two AI models (ChatGPT and DeepSeek) propose distinct solutions.
3.  **Comparison:** The solutions are analyzed, and the speaker expresses a preference for DeepSeek's approach.
4. **Conclusion:** The speaker expressed his feeling and anticipation.

[Music] welcome to real physics I'm again flashed by chat GPT and deep seek it's insane what kind of theoretical physics you can discuss with these models and well I just give you a little example and to give you a little bit of context we're talking about Maxell equations here and you see uh this one in the middle there is the conservation of charge for example then you have electromagnetic waves in the first equation here and also in the um third one and here's the famous term Maxwell added that the the change of electric field is equivalent to an electric current and then you have the curlf free magnetic field so this is all well known and you know I'm a fan of variable speed of light because it's a very interesting idea of Einstein in 1911 how to formulate general relativity and you can formulate general relativity in terms of variable speed of flight but as a little sideline the problem arises how to deal with variable speed of FL in Maxwell's equations here this is a problem and it's one of the favorite things I wreck my head around and yeah just see what happens here I ask the question it's a very short question to chbt I have a theoretical physics problem for you you variable relativity oh sorry I even messed this up can be formulated with variable speed of light as Einstein had already proposed in 1911 however let's take that for granted we should not debate that I wonder what impact this has on electrodynamics if the speed of flight depends on space and time Maxwell's equations must be altered can you propose a reasonable or simple way to do that and now he thinks for chpt thinks for 14 seconds and really grasps the problem and sees what's to be done and formulates um the speed of light with the electric and magnetic constants uh everything is time and space dependent and uh well he just writes down correctly the equations thinks about and then he comes up with indeed a solution I also proposed then back then let's see here I said okay we have this mess created by variable speed of light but the most simple solution would be that one and that's also the solution jpt proposes he does the correct derivatives all these Vector analysis rules and well he even adds another theoretical interesting theoretical aspect how to look at it from the point of view of a metric which is very interesting yeah and uh this is his solution I'm really stunned but now I ask also deep seek just to get a little comparison of these two models and look what happens here so the same question with a typo here but I think he got it as well and now deep seek things for 148 seconds that's incredible and in this respect CH is a little bit lazy so look what he does it's really he considers a lot of possibilities and looks from this and from that perspective and then he comes up with some doubts and say wait maybe look at it from another the point of view and uh what can we do and so on and the forth and after a lot of reasoning a lot of thinking he comes up with an even more stunning solution to the problem I like this even more because he considers the variability of the speed of light but he goes to original to the original problem instead of putting it into the Epsilon not mu not he formulates it with an extra term depending on the gradient C and on the time derivative of C now this is really insane and I'm impressed by the result but also about the thinking process it's a little pity that he doesn't write the formulas well here because at the mobile phone at the app it works but it's really stunning what capabilities these models have and uh yes I think we very soon going to have really serious theoretical physics discussions with these models and of course uh much of contemporary physics I think is misguided and we haven't understood a lot of things yet so I will be pushing the boundaries and trying to extend theories trying to discuss new theories and if you're interested in fundamental physics this channel is for you if you enjoyed the video don't forget to like it [Music]
