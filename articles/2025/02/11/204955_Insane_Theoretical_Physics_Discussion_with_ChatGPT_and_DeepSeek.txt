Description:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the content, adhering to your specifications:

**1. Core Point:**

AI models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek demonstrate impressive capabilities in handling complex theoretical physics problems, specifically proposing solutions for modifying Maxwell's equations to accommodate a variable speed of light.

**2. Overarching Framework:**

The content presents a problem-solving scenario within theoretical physics. It follows these stages:

*   **Problem Definition:**  How do Maxwell's equations change if the speed of light (c) is variable (dependent on space and time)? This stems from the concept of variable speed of light in general relativity.
*   **AI-Driven Solutions:**  Both ChatGPT and DeepSeek are used to generate solutions.
*   **Solution Comparison:**  The solutions from the two models are compared, highlighting DeepSeek's more comprehensive and, in the speaker's opinion, superior approach.
*   **Implication:** The demonstration suggests the potential for AI to contribute significantly to theoretical physics research.

Content:
[Music] welcome to real physics I'm again flashed by chat GPT and deep seek it's insane what kind of theoretical physics you can discuss with these models and well I just give you a little example and to give you a little bit of context we're talking about Maxell equations here and you see uh this one in the middle there is the conservation of charge for example then you have electromagnetic waves in the first equation here and also in the um third one and here's the famous term Maxwell added that the the change of electric field is equivalent to an electric current and then you have the curlf free magnetic field so this is all well known and you know I'm a fan of variable speed of light because it's a very interesting idea of Einstein in 1911 how to formulate general relativity and you can formulate general relativity in terms of variable speed of flight but as a little sideline the problem arises how to deal with variable speed of FL in Maxwell's equations here this is a problem and it's one of the favorite things I wreck my head around and yeah just see what happens here I ask the question it's a very short question to chbt I have a theoretical physics problem for you you variable relativity oh sorry I even messed this up can be formulated with variable speed of light as Einstein had already proposed in 1911 however let's take that for granted we should not debate that I wonder what impact this has on electrodynamics if the speed of flight depends on space and time Maxwell's equations must be altered can you propose a reasonable or simple way to do that and now he thinks for chpt thinks for 14 seconds and really grasps the problem and sees what's to be done and formulates um the speed of light with the electric and magnetic constants uh everything is time and space dependent and uh well he just writes down correctly the equations thinks about and then he comes up with indeed a solution I also proposed then back then let's see here I said okay we have this mess created by variable speed of light but the most simple solution would be that one and that's also the solution jpt proposes he does the correct derivatives all these Vector analysis rules and well he even adds another theoretical interesting theoretical aspect how to look at it from the point of view of a metric which is very interesting yeah and uh this is his solution I'm really stunned but now I ask also deep seek just to get a little comparison of these two models and look what happens here so the same question with a typo here but I think he got it as well and now deep seek things for 148 seconds that's incredible and in this respect CH is a little bit lazy so look what he does it's really he considers a lot of possibilities and looks from this and from that perspective and then he comes up with some doubts and say wait maybe look at it from another the point of view and uh what can we do and so on and the forth and after a lot of reasoning a lot of thinking he comes up with an even more stunning solution to the problem I like this even more because he considers the variability of the speed of light but he goes to original to the original problem instead of putting it into the Epsilon not mu not he formulates it with an extra term depending on the gradient C and on the time derivative of C now this is really insane and I'm impressed by the result but also about the thinking process it's a little pity that he doesn't write the formulas well here because at the mobile phone at the app it works but it's really stunning what capabilities these models have and uh yes I think we very soon going to have really serious theoretical physics discussions with these models and of course uh much of contemporary physics I think is misguided and we haven't understood a lot of things yet so I will be pushing the boundaries and trying to extend theories trying to discuss new theories and if you're interested in fundamental physics this channel is for you if you enjoyed the video don't forget to like it [Music]
