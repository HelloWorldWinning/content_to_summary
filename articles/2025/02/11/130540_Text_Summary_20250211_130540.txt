Description:
Here's a structured summary of the provided content:

**1. Outline and Structure**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   The paper explores enhancing language model reasoning using pure reinforcement learning (RL), without supervised data.

*   **Methodology (DeepSeek-R1-Zero):**
    *   Base Model: DeepSeek-V3-Base.
    *   RL Framework: GRPO.
    *   Outcome:  DeepSeek-R1-Zero emerged, showing strong reasoning performance on benchmarks (e.g., AIME 2024).
    *   Challenges: Poor readability and language mixing.

*   **Methodology (DeepSeek-R1):**
    *   Addressed DeepSeek-R1-Zero's issues and improved performance.
    *   Multi-stage training pipeline:
        1.  Cold-start data fine-tuning of DeepSeek-V3-Base.
        2.  Reasoning-oriented RL (similar to DeepSeek-R1-Zero).
        3.  SFT data creation via rejection sampling from the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data.  Retraining of DeepSeek-V3-Base.
        4.  Additional RL process with prompts from all scenarios.

*   **Distillation:**
    *   Distilling knowledge from DeepSeek-R1 into smaller models (e.g., Qwen2.5-32B).
    *   Direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 was more effective than applying RL to the smaller model.
    *   Significant performance improvements in distilled models (14B, 32B, 70B) on reasoning benchmarks.

*   **Contributions:**
    *   **Post-Training with RL:**  Successfully applied RL directly to the base model *without* prior supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leading to the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero with emergent reasoning abilities.  This validates the potential of pure RL for reasoning in LLMs.
    *   **DeepSeek-R1 Pipeline:** Introduced a multi-stage pipeline (two RL stages, two SFT stages) for discovering reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences.

**2. Core Point**

Pure reinforcement learning can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models, even without supervised fine-tuning, and a multi-stage training pipeline involving both RL and SFT can further optimize performance and address emergent issues.

**3. Overarching Framework**

The overarching framework is a multi-stage training and distillation process for enhancing LLM reasoning abilities. This framework combines:

1.  **Initial RL Exploration:**  Directly applying RL to a base model to discover reasoning patterns.
2.  **Iterative Refinement:**  A cyclical process of RL (for discovering new reasoning approaches) and SFT (for consolidating knowledge and addressing issues like readability).
3.  **Knowledge Distillation:** Transferring the enhanced reasoning capabilities from a larger, refined model to smaller, more efficient models.

Content:
In this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL).
Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process.
Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPOÂ (Shao etÂ al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning.
During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks.
For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912.
However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline.
Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217.
We further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-32BÂ (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying RL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are crucial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and LlamaÂ (Dubey etÂ al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source QwQ-32B-PreviewÂ (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a new record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models.
1.1 Contributions
Post-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model
  
 
We directly apply RL to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.
  
 
We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the modelâ s reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.
We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.
