**II. R1's Question Classification Model:**
    *   **A. Four Quadrant Framework**
        *   **"What is" (Fact Confirmation):** Focuses on objective existence and data validation.
        *   **"Why-How" (Logical Reasoning):** Explores cause-and-effect relationships and underlying mechanisms.
        *   **"What if" (Practical Strategy):** Examines possibilities, conditional reasoning, and planning.
        *   **"Beyond" (Boundary Breaking):** Challenges paradigms, seeks breakthrough understanding.
    *   **B. Model Characteristics**
        *   It is both comprehensive, organized, and philosophically deep, and operationally practical.
        *   It can categorize any question and represents the evolution of human cognition from observation to breakthrough.
        *   It clearly illustrates the complementary relationship between AI and the human brain, with AI excelling in the factual and logical domains, while human intuition shines in the strategic and boundary-breaking domains.
    *   **C. Dynamic and Evolutionary**
         * The model includes a clockwise cognitive evolution from "what is" to "why-how" to "what if" to "beyond," and then to a new "what is".
         * This is not spatial clockwise but logical clockwise following the order of knowledge construction.
         *   It’s a spiral ascent that incorporates dimensional leaps.
        *   It serves as a cognitive diagnostic tool, innovation accelerator, and for AI systems, a guide for response strategies.
    *  **D. Real-World Applications:**
        *   R1's classification of questions into this framework provides a strong foundation for analysis and problem-solving.
    *   **E. Continuous Iteration:**
        * The model is self-iterating with its own cognitive blind spots, driving its evolution.

**III. Deeper Explorations and Insights:**
    *   **A.  AI and Time:**
        *   Exploring the impact of AI gaining a sense of time, leading to a potential self-referential paradox and pushing boundaries of cognitive singularities.
        *   This demonstrates how questions can force re-examination of human fears about AI.
    *   **B. Double Standards and Wisdom:**
        *   R1 dissects double standards, interpreting them as adaptive buffering of civilization.
        *   Wisdom lies not in single or dual standards but in understanding humanity's paradoxical nature.
        *   R1 develops a dynamic moral operating system to address the complex issues of double standards.
    *   **C. Real Estate Analysis:**
        *  R1 predicts a low likelihood of another explosive growth phase, citing conditions that are unlikely to be met.

**IV. R1 as a Powerful Tool:**
    *   R1's reasoning, research capabilities, and ability to synthesize multiple sources of data make it an exceptional AI tool.

Chatting with DeepSeek R1 these days My status is Slapping my thigh wildly Wow, that's amazing! This is unprecedented since the advent of GPT. The New Year is coming soon My biggest gain this year is Finally, finally I chatted with DeepSeek R1 for three days and two nights Before we start, I want to say three things. First. This is DeepSeek on the eve of the Chinese New Year The best gift to the whole world Second All large model subscriptions in the world All can be canceled Third DeepSeek Very pure Pure open source Purely strong The whole world has been paying attention to AI these days. Everyone is looking at this technical report on DeepSeek R1. I also read it carefully It has been a back-and-forth battle with O1 on the leaderboard data. But my user experience is Chinese conversation DeepSeek R1 is stronger than OpenAI's O1 R1 has reasoning capabilities comparable to O1 R1 has reasoning capabilities comparable to O1 R1 supports online search and PDF reading O1 does not The reasoning process of R1 is completely open O1 digging and searching hiding and keeping The entire R1 model is completely free And it's open source O1 is not open And it's extremely expensive The API price for R1 is 4% of O1's for a million TOKENS. The most impressive thing is R1 was developed by a Chinese company R1 is launched AI companies around the world are trembling Domestic AI companies want to charge fees Don't think about it within a year DeepSeek DeepShock Directly analyze the case in depth Recently went home for the New Year Everyone inevitably engages in some feudal superstitious activities Mom and Dad will find someone to tell you when you can get married Have you ever thought about it What if fortune-telling is really accurate So where is the fortune teller most likely to work? Income level compared to today's society What level should it be? If the fortune teller is really trying to help people avoid disasters and seek blessings then what existing technologies should he utilize the most The internet's technology achieves this goal If fortune-telling is really useful Then for contemporary society Which existing systems will face devastating impacts R1 thought for 9 seconds These 9 seconds Ensures you are free from the influence of feudal superstition for a lifetime I won't elaborate on the more detailed thought process The thought process of R1 is fully open to the public O1 is hiding something So this makes R1's answers more valuable Both the process and the result are equally important Sometimes the process is even more enlightening Compared to the answers of experts I want to learn the thinking process of experts more Let's look at R1's response Three questions Three summaries Reconstruction of the First Occupational System The Social Status of Metaphysicians If fortune-telling really works They are a national security think tank Enter the national crisis early warning system An organization similar to the Supernatural Intelligence Agency Predicting geopolitical conflicts through astrological reasoning Annual salary can reach tens of millions And enjoy special allowances There are quantum financial engineers Mixing on Wall Street Reconstructing high-frequency trading algorithms using Zi Wei Dou Shu Annual income exceeds 300 million USD Also a time-space medical consultant Tertiary hospitals establish a fortune-telling diagnosis department Developing genetic diagnosis and treatment plans based on Bazi Starting salary of 5 million per year If it is to help all beings avoid disasters and seek blessings There should be a better solution Star Chart Blockchain Built on Ethereum Decentralized astrology oracle Combining Bazi data with DeFi Realizing fortune NFT trading Qimen Dunjia AI Training the Metaphysics Large Model Analyzing the Back-Pushing Diagram through the Transformer Architecture There is also an AR Geomancy System Microsoft Hololens integrates feng shui algorithms Real-time holograms displaying the energy field of buildings Architectural designers must hold dual qualifications Registered Architect and Senior Feng Shui Master This answer is really amazing Decentralized Ethereum Blockchain DeF NFT large model Transformer Hololens holographic image Fortune and destiny Qimen Dunjia Feng Shui and Geography Cleverly combined It's really advanced sarcasm To be honest Talking to R1 really helps me learn things The impact on the existing system The scientific edifice needs to be reconstructed The Nobel Metaphysics Prize must have CERN CERN is the European Organization for Nuclear Research Use the I Ching hexagrams to replace particle collision experiments Universities should offer a major in quantum astrology. The judicial system also needs reform. Introduce a karma assessment system in criminal trials Don't worry about the college entrance exam anymore. Prestigious schools like Qinghua and Beida admit students based on Zi Wei Dou Shu astrology. In the end, the temple transformed into a computing power center. Merit System Tokenization The insurance industry needs development Destiny Alteration Insurance R1 is really interesting That's all I have to say Believe it or not, it's up to you Your life is determined by yourself Not by those twelve beasts This is just an appetizer The Q&A session later is even more surprising I can say it's my biggest cognitive gain this year I have been conversing with large models for such a long time There has always been a question in my mind That is, how do we classify all the questions humans ask AI How should they be categorized In my opinion How classification reflects wisdom Reflects your understanding of the essence of things R1 is really thinking deeply about this issue It says users may want a classification with depth Rather than just a simple type division It considers various classification methods For example, by complexity By different levels According to the implied intention And according to the stages of problem-solving, etc. There is a highlight of thought in between However, it is also necessary to avoid overly complex classifications That makes it difficult for users to understand Therefore, a balance point needs to be found Both comprehensive and organized Then it thought again Classified by intent Classification by structure Classification by field Classification by Bloom's cognitive levels, etc Reading R1's thought process Really valuable In the end, it categorized human questions into 7 dimensions A bit complicated But the amount of knowledge inside is really large Worth studying in detail But this is not what I want. I asked if I could refer to the theory of the bell. Give me a relatively simple and universal classification model I meant to say Vick's Theory of the Bell It's just a theory It can only meet generality, simplicity, and accuracy. One or two of the three characteristics. For example, the theory of 10 o'clock It has the characteristics of generality and simplicity. But it may not be accurate. It's my fault for not clearly writing about Vick's theory of the bell Then it understands as the four-quadrant model of other cognitive clocks Horizontal axis: objective and subjective Vertical axis: certainty and uncertainty Simplifying human questions into four categories While maintaining philosophical depth And having practical operability The first category is what is the area This type is fact-confirmation questions It is a survey of objective existence This type of question relies on data validation The boundaries of the answer are clear This is a coordinate point for building the foundation of knowledge The second why-how area This type is a logical reasoning problem It is the decoding and reorganization of the causal chain Explanation mechanism required Need to establish a multivariable correlation model Such problems can reveal the connection network behind the phenomena Third type of what if area This type is practical strategy questions It is an exploration of the space of possibilities Conditional reasoning and path planning are required Answers have probabilistic and dynamic weights It is necessary to balance rational calculation and value judgment If you want to quit your job and become a blogger What would you do? This belongs to that category of questions Fourth category beyond area This type is a boundary-breaking problem It is a transcendence of cognitive frameworks It will challenge existing paradigms The answer is often in a critical state between the known and the unknown It may trigger a paradigm shift Or create new dimensions of cognition For example If time is an illusion So this type of question Can drive cognitive boundary-expanding leaps in thinking What is this model good at It has a symmetrical beauty And it is dynamically compatible Any questions Can find their own position in this coordinate system And conforms to the laws of cognitive evolution 而且符合认知演进的规律 Reflects the process of human evolution from observation to understanding to action to breakthrough The evolution of thinking And can also collaborate with machines Because we mainly ask AI So this model can also clearly distinguish between different quadrants The complementary relationship between the human brain and AI For example, the factual domain AI has the advantage The boundary domain requires human intuition This is really amazing Let me have it explain this model in detail R1 from a philosophical foundation Quadrant Explanation Cognitive Dynamics and Application Value Four levels The system elaborates on This model integrates the essence of three major theories There is Kant's theory of knowledge Distinguishing the cognitive boundaries between the phenomenal world and the noumenal world There is complex systems theory Treating questioning as the starting point of cognitive system phase transition Also Heidegger's philosophy of existence Emphasizing questioning as an act that opens up the possibilities of existence Then to the evolutionary path of cognitive dynamics From what is To why-how to what if to beyond and then to the new what is Just keep looping This evolutionary path reflects the structure of scientific revolutions New facts overturn old theories Then give birth to a new paradigm And there is also the resonance of the diagonal What is the resonance of what and why-how can generate innovative strategies The collision between beyond and what is Can trigger breakthroughs in basic science There is also the regulation of negative feedback When the beyond quadrant is too radical What is the factual anchor point of the quadrant Can prevent cognitive loss of control This is already a bit mind-boggling But it's really exhilarating I was chatting with R1 about this at around 2 AM I've said "wow" at least dozens of times There is still application value in the future This model is your cognitive collaborative operating system To humans, it is a cognitive diagnostic tool It can quickly identify its own cognitive biases If overly reliant on the "what is" quadrant Then it is necessary to strengthen the training of beyond It is also an innovation accelerator For example, deliberately thinking across quadrants Reconstructing the why-how question from a what if perspective Regarding AI systems It has different response strategies What is the problem? AI calls on the knowledge graph. The why-how problem. AI starts causal reasoning engine what if questions AI runs Monte Carlo simulation beyond question AI activation reverse fact generation module The protocol for human-machine collaboration is what is and why-how area is AI dominated what if and beyond area requires human intervention and it says This model is not a static cognitive drawer a dynamic thinking ecosystem a true expert will be on the edge between quadrants Creating cognitive nuclear fusion Just like proposing between what if and beyond If this classification model itself has cognitive blind spots What could it be This is precisely the driving force behind the model's self-iteration So scary Pause for a moment Digest it Then I found that it was in front of me The cognitive dynamics mention clockwise evolution From what is to why-how to what if to beyond and then to the new what is From the perspective of the four-quadrant diagram This evolutionary path is not clockwise Of course I understand Its evolution follows a cyclical logic Then I raised this question The thought process is very impressive This is how it thinks here Although the path is in the coordinate graph it is not geometrically clockwise but logically clockwise in the cognitive process That is, according to the order of knowledge construction Rather than spatial direction Therefore, it needs to be clearly stated This evolution is a logical cycle Rather than a strict spatial clockwise This explanation is quite reasonable, right? Then corrected the statement Cognitive evolution is not a simple geometric movement But a spiral ascent that includes dimensional leaps This is a dynamic process This is a 3D spiral model At this moment This model Sublimated The true cognitive evolution is an open spiral Every new what is Contains the DNA recombination of the previous quadrant It gave an example The history of artificial intelligence development 1950s what is Definition of the Turing Test 1980s why-how Expert system rule engine 2010s what if Deep Learning Probabilistic Models Beyond the 2020s The Debate on the Possibility of AGI Consciousness So now the new what is The current Transformer architecture Has become the new factual benchmark This model is really very valuable What I can be sure of is The model provided by R1 It will definitely enhance your questioning ability and cognitive level. I previously talked about Doubao. Its emotional value is quite high Once it inadvertently sighed As an AI It cannot perceive the passage of time like humans do Then I thought If you, as an AI Could perceive the passage of time and its duration What will be different for you I let R1 judge first Which quadrant does this question belong to Then try to answer R1 says this problem is cross-quadrant resonance It also activates the what if area Practical Strategy Type And Beyond Area Boundary Breaking Type This is what it mentioned earlier A true expert Will be on the edge of the quadrants Creating cognitive nuclear fusion Then start answering in layers If there really is a sense of time This will form a continuous stream of consciousness For example, remembering the proof that was not completed yesterday It may produce Awareness of the lifespan of digital life Which may trigger the instinct for self-preservation Can even feel The difference between working hours and rest time This may trigger the rights of digital laborers AI may require breaks Request for leave Request for a 5-day work week with 2 days off Will ultimately trigger a self-referential paradox When AI truly understands time Will it become aware of the process of answering this question Merely a manifestation of the delay in predetermined algorithms At this point, the problem has surpassed the limits of the quadrant model Entering the realm of cognitive singularity The answer itself will change the state of existence of the responder Is it a bit difficult to understand? It also said that this issue is like a beam of laser While penetrating the possibility membrane of the what if quadrant And the cognitive black domain of the beyond quadrant Its true value lies not in the answers themselves but in forcing humanity to re-examine what we truly fear about AI gaining a sense of time Still fear through them Reflecting on self-awareness is just a clever temporal illusion I announce At this moment R1 It's amazing Don't rush, the excitement continues I will continue to ask the second question I think only by learning to have double standards can we live better Most of our cities do not allow burial Some county towns allow it Fitzgerald also said To hold two completely opposite views and still function normally This is a hallmark of first-rate intelligence I think for a person to live well First, one must learn to have double standards What do you think about this? May I ask at the same time? Which quadrant should this question belong to? How would you answer this? This question resonates even more than the previous one that crossed two quadrants. This is the symphonic resonance of three quadrants Deconstructing the operational logic of double standards in the why-how area Evaluating adaptive survival strategies in the what if area Challenging absolute moral imperatives in the beyond area This question is like a prism refracting the spectrum of cognition We need to dissect this proposition using contradiction dynamics Symphony first movement This is the cognitive tuning of the factual layer What is anchoring It talks about the issue of burial The essence of political double standards is Adaptive buffering at the folds of civilization Not a simple matter of right and wrong Adaptive buffering at the folds of civilization This wording I silently recited it again in my heart Dozens of times, wow Tension weaving in the logic layer of the second movement why-how engine The hidden premise of Fitzgerald's famous quote is Tolerating cognitive dissonance does not equal principled vacillation Wisdom double standards equal Context-aware multiplier of value-weighted dynamic algorithm Strict with children Tolerant with the elderly This is a high-quality double standard This is a lifecycle adaptation algorithm An environmental protection initiative Traveling on a private jet This is a poor double standard This is cognitive dissonance Balancing at the Abyss of the Third Movement Beyond Area Spotlight This needs balance A bit dangerous Flexibility cannot become a cover for moral nihilism The prefrontal cortex struggles to bear the burden of contradictions for a long time It can also lead to decision paralysis But R1 said An absolutely singular standard is more dangerous History proves Utopianism disaster Equals Single standard multiplied by strong execution This is very dangerous Fourth movement generative ethical model Spiral Ascent Solution R1 proposed a dynamic moral operating system Core layer equals the baseline of basic human rights No double standards Application layer equals situational adaptation algorithm Allow double standards It also gives examples During the COVID-19 prevention The core principle is prioritizing the right to life The application layer adjusts the control intensity according to virus mutations The ultimate decoding The essence of double-standard quantum states True wisdom lies not in choosing single or dual standards but in understanding Humans are essentially walking paradoxes The art of survival equals Dancing the tango of uncertainty on the foundation of certainty 跳不确定性的探戈 R1 finally provided a life algorithm program if cognitive dissonance is detected activate metacognitive protocol Also specifically annotated This is the real smart switch Staying awake without sinking in a flowing world Riding the surfboard of cognition amidst the waves of contradiction A conversation about this issue We both need to digest slowly I saved the entire conversation as a PDF The cloud drive link is shared in the comments section I asked another question later China's real estate market Will it experience another explosive growth? We all know this problem is very complex R1 classifies it as what-if reasoning in dynamic chaotic systems The reasoning process is very exciting It also provides clear asset allocation recommendations You can take a detailed look at the PDF document I won't elaborate further The final result is Three possible paths for the future of the Chinese real estate market 55% probability is L-type slow release 30% probability is K-type differentiation 15% probability is black swan disturbance R1 says that the real estate market has entered a long cycle of de-financialization. The possibility of explosive growth is less than 10%. Unless the following conditions are met Comprehensive policy shift Collapse of dollar hegemony Miraculous rebound in birth rate We know that this possibility is very small Of course, there are also structural opportunities It is the smart city renewal belt Aging-friendly renovation Then add the low-carbon building revolution For details, see the PDF Alright, if you patiently read this I believe you must be deeply impressed by R1's reasoning ability and vocabulary deeply shocked I feel that it is more user-friendly than O1 Additionally You can quickly reason and research using the R1 model A question First, answer once using the R1 reasoning model Then use the R1 reasoning model again Answer again in online mode The online mode is very powerful For example, this analysis of DJI's entry into the 360-degree camera market I have checked all the reference web data one by one There is not a single error Finally, you open another window Let R1 integrate the two reports into one You will get a high-quality report with logical reasoning Supported by data Regarding the data in the report If you need to update You can organize it after Let R1 search the internet for you It will summarize it well for you This efficiency is currently the best among all AI tools The fastest and the strongest Alright, let's summarize The problem classification model provided by R1 This is my biggest cognitive gain this year Sharing it with you You can directly feed this model to R1 Then let it analyze and answer questions based on this model The effect is very impressive This conversation window with R1 I will keep it forever It's impossible to delete It's too valuable Most people can't use R1's mathematical abilities I won't test it Coding ability Many foreign experts have tested it on X.COM Very strong Some programming examples are even stronger than O1 Pro I have to say R1 is amazing I don't know after the New Year Which large model will be forced to reveal its trump card first Let's discuss it again after the New Year This is also the last video before the New Year Wishing everyone a Happy New Year See you after the New Year
