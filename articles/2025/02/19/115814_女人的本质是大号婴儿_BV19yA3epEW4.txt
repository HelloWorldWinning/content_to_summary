Content:
 Most women's minds are like big babies, when arguing their brains are hijacked. Trying to reason is like typing on a crashed computer. In my book Beyond Belief, I said to avoid argument traps. Don't try to change her. Instead, shift the focus from being right or wrong to her feelings. Say something like, compared to who's right, I care more about whether you feel okay right now. She'll feel understood and valued. The tense atmosphere will ease, creating room for better communication. Ignoring emotions makes her think you're cold. Focusing on feelings makes her feel you get her. The book has more examples and solutions for handling these situations.
