Yo, I'm here. Welcome to the Speculation Lab. Smart Money Concept Indicators and Pivot Point Indicators can be said to be the two best trading indicators so far. Unlike other lagging indicators, they will show the price movement in advance. In the chart, you will get more trading opportunities with super high accuracy. Believe me, this is definitely the last issue that price action traders should not miss. Next, I will tell you all their secrets. For the first five minutes of the trader, you must hit my subscribe button. Yes, it is now. As usual, the details of the indicator will be listed in the description column below the video and in the top comment. The first thing to say is of course the smart money concept indicator Smart Money Concepts [LUX] We open the indicator search bar, enter the full name of the indicator, click to save and add to the chart. This is an all-round comprehensive indicator that can automatically mark the market structure, including high and low points of order blocks, fair areas, discount premium areas, etc. These are often used to judge price behavior The classic method of trading with smart money is the most respected concept by price action traders. They believe that institutional or large-capital group traders are smarter than retail investors. They try to find traces of these participants in the market as much as possible, and the probability of following them to make a profit is higher than To do your own trading, you need to be more reliable. The mode in the indicator settings can choose the default history or current. The current display only displays the latest data in the chart. The style can choose the default color or monochrome. The internal structure function will be automatically marked with dotted lines and labels Whether the bid price breaks through the market structure to determine the trend of the market. The BOS label refers to the price breaking through the high point of the previous uptrend or falling below the low point of the previous downtrend. CHOCH is the price that fell below the higher low point in the uptrend, or A breakout of a lower high in a downtrend. This gives a potential reversal indication. Swing Market Structure Shows a larger level of market structure. The labels are the same markers, but the lines are shown as solid lines to differentiate them. If you turn on Show Swing Points, higher highs, higher lows, lower highs, lower lows These information describing the trend will be marked on the chart, and the trend will be clear at a glance. The order block is similar to the concept of the supply and demand zone we often say. The order block is regarded as a generalized supply and demand area. The order block is also the price area that people think that large institutions and large capital groups are easy to participate in. It can not only be used as a position selection for support and resistance, but also can be used to find potential stop profit and stop loss in bitcoin dollars. Take the 15-minute chart as an example. When the price is near the red order block, we can have two trading options. For example, after the price breaks through the red order block and pushes back, we can choose to go long at this position according to the price behavior, or we can wait for the price to fall below the red order block. Choose an opportunity to enter the market and go short. The stop loss is set near the recent high point or the upper edge of the order block. The take profit can be selected near the blue order block below. The equal height and equal low point functions will be displayed in the chart Similar to double-top or double-bottom structure, if you need this function, you can also open it and look down. The fair value gap is also a very important function. It can mark the unbalanced area on the chart, and the real big K-line gaps in any time period or some The continuous rising and falling k-lines belong to the category of unbalanced liquidity. We can open the fixed-range trading volume distribution chart and select the part of the k-line to see the part that marks the supply value gap. The internal trading volume is relatively small, indicating this area There is a serious shortage of sell orders or buy orders. Orders must match sell orders upward or buy orders downward before they can continue to move. Liquidity imbalance is an obvious signal for large funds to enter the market. The trading algorithm of large institutions and large capital groups has a high probability of guiding prices. Immediately or It is to partially or completely fill these areas at a certain time in the future to keep the market in balance. These price areas will also make it easier to have good profit opportunities. It is worthy of attention. Monthly highs and lows are marked. These levels are useful as references for support and resistance. If you are an intraday trader, the previous day's highs and lows can provide you with some good trading opportunities. If you are doing an hourly trade Short-term traders at the 4-hour level can also choose the highest price and lowest price of the previous week or month as a reference. The last function is the premium discount area. As the name suggests, if the price discount is very cheap, someone will buy at the discounted price. When the price rises too high, some people will start to sell again because the premium is too high, and institutions will always operate like this. There is an essential difference from retail investors chasing ups and downs. We understand the concept before being smart, and we can also be in an upward trend. Only buy at a discount and only sell at a premium in a down market We can see how important these price levels are What a profitable price action indicator The indicator covers almost every concept of smart money including market structure Flow Sex and price movement behavior This is really the indicator you should have the most. The only downside is that the smart pre-concept indicator still lacks a pivot point function. This is a strategy that should not be ignored. We open the indicator search bar and enter Pivot Points Standard will The pivot point standard Pivot Points Standard is added to the chart. The indicator is composed of a pivot point P and several supports S resistance R. The trend can be judged according to the rise, fall or sideways of the pivot point P, and the P point can also be used as the price may change The support and resistance positions faced When the price moves to these specific areas, there is a high probability that it will react. This is a very powerful trading tool. The reason why the pivot point indicator is reliable is that it is purely based on the aggregated data of price movements. I am used to only using The color of pivot point P and support level S1 resistance level R1 can refer to my settings. Other functions that are not used can be ticked off. Take the 15-minute Bitcoin USD trading pair as an example For intraday trading within 15 minutes, the pivot time frame can be set to one day. When the P point and S1 point of the pivot point indicator are all higher than the previous P point in a row, it means that the short-term trend is upward. When the price falls to P point, you can go long with the trend The stop loss can be placed near S1 or the short-term low point. The stop profit is best placed at a position with a profit-loss ratio of 2: 1 or more. The rule of shorting with the trend is just the opposite. When the P point and R1 point of the pivot point indicator are all lower than the previous P point in a row It indicates that the short-term trend is downward. When the price returns to point P, you can enter a short position. The stop loss can be placed near S1 or the short-term high point. The stop profit can also be placed at a position above the profit-loss ratio of 2: 1. The pivot point indicator is applicable It is applicable to the stock, foreign exchange and cryptocurrency markets and is suitable for any cycle. We only need to analyze the price behavior based on these positions drawn. Near these positions, possible reversal or breakthrough signals have been found. It is enough to find a trading opportunity with strong certainty. Well, check whether I clicked the subscription button so as not to miss a more profitable trading system.
