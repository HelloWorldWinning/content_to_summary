that's right guys there is a new AI in town and it's called Deep seek R1 okay and it's a free AI everyone is going bananas about it including me because the question that I have is is it good for creating trading strategies because that's what we are all about on this channel right creating improving and automating trading strategies and as you know I have a test suit with easy medium and hard challenges for creating trading strategies for the AI okay we already tested many of them and we always going to continue testing the newest ones which is this one right so is it better than the rest is it better than chat GPT than Gemini than Claude and all these other guys right listen the thing is it's free okay and if it's free it can help a lot of people has the potential to help a lot of people but only if it actually gives good results otherwise it's a waste of time right so I invested my time to figure out if this AI is any good for trade automation strategies and the results are in this video okay we're going to run the pr you have full access to the prompts by the way check this out there is document that you can open right now there's a link down below to a Google sheet not the Google sheet a Google Document and you have all the prompts and all the code that all of these AIS have created that's even better because then you can actually take the code and try it yourself and that's basically your basis for building a trading strategy right for improving it even so with all of that in mind remember this is not Financial advice crypto is risky you can lose lose all of your money okay but that's why you subscribe to this channel you like the videos you massage actually the like button because I need a good massage so give it a good massage all right and also you watch the algo trading knowledge playlist which is actually a free course on algo trading creating strategies using AI automation it's like you will see it's amazing it's in my opinion lifechanging so with all of that in mind let's see how to create trading strategies with deep seek how to fix potential issues that happen along the way how to put the strategy in trading View and also what the results are are they good or bad is it any good for trading strategies let's check it out okay guys let's get into this this is super exciting right also for me because AI is making steps very very quickly this is a free Ai and I'm quite excited about the results remember we have a test suit we're not just winging this we have a process of testing these AIS if there any good for creating trading strategies right so the easy difficulty is to take an indicator and convert it into a strategy by giving it exactly when to buy when to sell based on the indicator right so we have deep seek i1 and we will find out if it was any good if it managed this challenge then the medium difficulty is to take a strategy that already exists and improve it by adding another indicator to it now this is harder right because there is code already it has to add new code to it and make the strategy better we tell it how to add the indicator right but we want it to do it right so this is harder let's see how it performed over there as well and for the hard difficulty we well it's very hard we give it the prompt to create a completely new trading strategy from the scratch we don't give it any code it has to figure it all out itself and because this is so hard we have two different versions of this right we have the version where we give it less input and the version where we give it more input to make its life a bit easier the funny thing is that more input is not always better but you will see right you will see that here in the video and again let's see how well it performed was it actually better than 01 which is a paid model and definitely important was it better than Gemini 1. 5 Pro because that thing is free right Gemini is free okay so if this is better then it's free and better know it's perfect so we want to figure this out we want to figure out if it actually made even better profits than the other ones Ultra exciting stuff and let's get started with the easy difficulty and you will see how I do it right you'll see the result we're going to check it out together in real time well I will speed up some of the thing because otherwise it takes forever let's get started all right let's go to our test document right this is the document that has all the prompts and this is what I use to test the AIS right so we can actually compare them with each other so the easy prompt here you can just take it and copy paste it you will have access to view only right you cannot edit but you don't need to edit anyway right you just need to copy paste it and you can edit in your own editor okay and keep in mind again that we have the full result of the o1 code that It produced using this prompt Claude Horizon and so on right and we're going to add deeps now together right so you see this in real time so I will copy this right and this is basically a prompt where what do you need to change here well you need to change only the indicator right so this is the stuff actually let me make it red here so you remember that this is what you change and you also change this because you tell him when to buy and when to sell but everything else it does itself right so it's the easy prompt because you give it more input and you give it what you want it to do it's just doing it for you right so it's a developer as an AI right okay so we copy this right just copy the whole thing and you go to deep seek by the way you go to the website you click on start now and then you click on create new chat you make sure to click on deep think because otherwise it's not thinking long enough to give you proper answer and you just paste the whole prompt okay and just do it okay so this is something that you do to figure out how this whole thing works right of course then you take it and you make your own strategy okay but first take this prompt right or the prompts I show you in this video to learn the process and to get to the same result and then you get the confidence to continue and build your own okay so as you can see here it tells me what it's thinking about right I'm not going to read this stuff right but it's cool like you can check it right it makes its own reasoning about how to build the whole thing and then we get the result and we can copy it into trading view I will show you how to copy that code put it in a strategy add it to the chat it's very easy to do and well I will speed this up until we get the code what is happen happening mate hopefully this result is good all right if I wait that long okay I want a good result the code is coming yeah this is a Ballinger band strategy doesn't matter the thing I want is that it creates the same output right the same profit and draw down like the other AIS right because that's how you compare if it does the right thing okay so I copied the code right I just click here copy okay then I go to trading View and in trading view I basically let's delete this right and in trading view I go here to pinescript and here I click on this arrow and create new strategy okay so it's completely new delete everything that you have here and paste the whole code in there and click save all right and then it will ask you whatever yeah click save and we don't have any coding errors which is awesome because that would be bad and then click here on add to chart let me see if I'm on yeah I'm definitely in the way so here click add to chart okay and once you've done that you can see the numbers and I'm in the way again so let me put me in the other corner so here you see the net profit is this the Max draw down is this and so on I already know that this is correct okay those are the numbers that we also get from the other AIS now let me show you what I mean by that right so here you can see I already have that here right because I've did that before but it's the same exact result I got three times in a row without changing code it works perfectly fine so those are exactly the results and when you go here to for example the Gemini it's also the same exact result you go to the other ones they're all the same right so here exactly the this is I think the clawed one it gave me exactly the same results and 01 of course is awesome but it's a paid model right so that's why so all of them give the same result so I would say that deeps manages the easy difficulty prompt I mean that's cool right all the other guys manage that as well so that's not a big surprise okay let's let's go to the medium one and for that we go back here and okay before that let me actually paste the whole code here because I want you to have access to the resulting code of this strategy okay so where was it here copy this and put it here right this is the result and maybe close it so that is not uh taking so much space okay so that's the thing right then we go to the medium prompt so you need to give it the indicator that you want to add to an existing strategy let me make this red as well so that's what you need to change right then you need to tell it when to buy and when to sell and so on and you need to give him the whole code of the existing strategy in this case is the Gan channel strategy right hint hint if you want the code for that this is the code for that right so I'm going to make it red as well because I just want to I forgot to do that before in the other video These are the parts you need to change okay the red parts right you can also change here but just you know have fun with it right this is to be creative right this is the whole point of this is that you're fully free to create your own thing right okay so I copy the medium prompt and it's quite long and then I go to the AI I create a new chat I cannot even decide which model to use okay there is only one model it seems the latest one I guess R1 whichever I post it here make sure that deep thinking is on okay and I let it run and you might expect that it will take forever yes it will take forever so I will speed this up quite a lot I mean proper strategy needs proper thinking so that's okay right make a coffee come back later where is my coffee by the way what the hell why don't I have a coffee prepared for this video because yeah because I'm not in my home and I don't have a coffee machine right now yeah code is coming that's great let's stop the watch it took well it took a long time so let's wait until the code is fully deployed here in front of me come on man I have to say those are a lot of variables that the AI can easily mess up so well let's see okay and uh I think this part here might be an issue let's see okay copy this go to trading view pin script right okay actually let's click on the code to make sure in the pinescript editor we have exactly this strategy open delete whatever is there put the new code click save and yeah you will have an issue and the issue is actually quite easy to fix and I might be able to give it to the AI to fix it for for me actually let's try that but the problem is that it's calling a function that is defined on the bottom and you simply have to copy the whole functions take them from here and put them above the line that has the problem because the functions have to be defined before you call them because this compiler is the way it is right so if I save this then it will work right but okay right so this is the strategy this is the result we're going to check if the result is correct very soon but in order to fix this let's try to fix this without you having to edit the code okay so let's try to do that I will undo this and I will tell him to fix it himself so let's save it to get the error again I will copy this error message right and it's in line 35 I will tell him I have an error in line 35 please fix it and um let's hope it can fix it actually I can see here it says I remember that in pinescript the order of functions matters exactly right so hopefully it understands now that it has to put the functions on top actually it does exactly this you see the functions are on top and hopefully the rest of the code is not changing to not mess up the strategy performance ah the rest of the code Remains the Same okay I mean it's not yeah it's smart actually that's pretty smart to be honest but um let's tell him give me the whole code please let's see if that works out okay those are the functions let's see inputs Okay cool so it's continuing that's great that's actually it looks promising let's say calculations all right trading logic I like the commenting also that's cool all right great let's copy this it looks promising okay so it should be working let's delete the whole thing again put the new code click save pray to God or to whatever you like all right actually that's funny actually so first of all coding errors are gone but second of all it has better results right like before it had somehow 800% net profit now it has way more let's check quickly the settings because it has to be 100% of equity okay yeah cool so it's not wrong 2018 okay cool great amazing result results right so I had to tell him a couple of times what to do but not that hard right and so let's copy this uh screenshot because I want to make sure to update my diagram over in mirror and uh definitely now you saw it in real life right it manages to solve the problem but I had to fix the code either manually or with what I just showed you with telling him how to fix it so let's put the screenshot here let's make sure that we place it properly and let's compare the net profit and draw down with the other strategy with the other AIS right to figure out if this is actually a better strategy right all right so 2, 000% profit 2, 500 with 14% draw down right that's pretty good so let's go here what do we have here well here we have issues so that didn't work out right here we have 1, 800 the thing is that um when I made this the Bitcoin price was uh lower okay so you know that's fine I guess the draw down is the same so I would say those are the exact same results to be honest if I would run these again I would pretty much get to the same result and also we can see 24 trades and here we had 22 trades so okay fine right so the strategy actually made more money over time that's even better so I would say this is a success I don't put it green because it didn't give it to me in the first try but it's very good right so amazing still free AI completely free solves the problem nicely whereas Gemini failed all right in this medium difficulty task which is unfortunate so definitely forget Gemini go to deeps for this type of problem this is so exciting guys because now we're going to the hard difficulty where it has to create strategies from scratch I give it only very little information and I'm super excited to see what it will do with that so let's go back to our document right oh by the way before I forget of course I have to put the medium difficulty code over here right so yeah let me quickly do it and deep seek I copy this right so I have the same formatting go to the medium put it here right and then I copy the code that I had so that you all have the code right later on when you need it and I paste it here and oops not like that like this because otherwise it creates issues okay so you have the Deep seek code as well for medium let's go to the hard one and well let's actually already create that section here so that we can easily paste it later so this is deep seek for the hard question version one and deep seek for the hard question version two right all right cool so hard prompt version one let's copy it and well actually this yeah the The Prompt is like not a lot okay honestly it's that's the whole point of being hard right because it doesn't give it a lot of information it says only it's a strategy based on G and channel and stochastic RSI right because the idea is can it create the same strategy or a similar strategy as we created above in the medium one right but in the medium one we gave it more code right we gave it the code that it has to combine so you know but now we don't give it any code we just say make it happen right so this is very very hard so let's see what it does with that so I will copy this prompt here and I will go to the AI create a new chat make sure the deep thinking is on paste it here and let it think actually I'm quite excited to see what it knows about the Gan Channel because that's something I know about you know about but does the AI even know what that is right so um the user wants long only strategy so entries are when the Gan Channel conditions are met interesting yeah okay that's true but then what does it know that here wait the original request says to use goshan channel strategy for entries and stochastic RSI to avoid bad trade so perhaps the entry is when the price is near the lower Channel indicating a potential bounce and stochastic RSI is not in a bad State whatever that means right so yeah it's it's thinking quite uh logically about this okay so let's see do we have code or not is it still thinking oh my God it's still yeah because I mean I didn't give it a lot of context it has to figure a lot of stuff out itself also I don't know how long it would think right does it think for an hour or like I don't know but um it thought for at least 60 seconds right so that's uh that's cool quite excited to see the results of this to be honest because um I mean this is not a lot of code right and uh the stochastic RSI let's see is it even the stochastic or not let me check so it calculates the stochastic RSI in a let's say interesting way the Gan channel is not really the Gan channel in my opinion okay let's see anyway what it did that's the whole point of this right so I go here I delete all of that I put the new code I click save and let's see we have no coding errors but okay I mean the profit is not amazing you know the draw down is okay but um yeah 66 profitable trades percent profitable trades it's awesome um it made some interesting trades but then it missed out also on a lot of stuff like this you know but um if you chat with it a bit more right you can basically tell him to be smart and to actually enter on different conditions right because now you can zoom in I mean you should you have to do that right because thei will not do absolutely 100% everything for you you have to have some idea on what you want right so if you zoom in now you can see Hey listen it sold here it made a small profit but it did never buy back right which is maybe not smart so you can say hey buy back when this condition happens or when it crosses this line or whatever and just tell him in words you can say upper line middle line lower line and stuff like that and basically you also want to add the stochastic RSI right on the bottom and you want to make sure that you're using the same values here uh as the strategy is using itself because otherwise you see different things and then you can say okay if the stochastic is above whatever number then you know consider an entry right so this is something you could do but let me actually take the screenshot and update my diagram because this is the result I got for basically the hardest problem that I have for the AI so I would go here and this was the this was the hard problem right that I gave it very little information right and it created a profitable strategy I mean that's already awesome right but let's compare it with the other profit and draw Downs to see if it was any good right so let's put the newest freshest screenshot here the reason I do this live with you is because I want you to see in real time what thei really does right without any kind of messing around in the background or fixing the code or any of that okay so this is the screenshot we remember that we have here about 50% profit about well 19% Max draw down 66% profitable trades okay not bad what do we have here okay about to double the profit but then also massive draw down so that's not great then here way less profit actually huge draw down not happy with that at all then this not didn't even make profit I mean this is pretty bad and then this is 800% profit with 40% draw down this is actually quite good okay this is 01 right so H still the best model right but still I mean actually I would say 01 is number one in this case and this is number two but this is a free model I mean I mean pretty nice right okay so that is awesome let's see what it does if I give it a bit more information about how to actually trade when using these two indicators right Goan Channel and also the stochastic RSI so let's take the prompt oh now I always forget that right copy the code update the document so after this video you have exactly the same code than I have right you have exactly the same thing to work with so it's hard prompt version one deep seek this is the code this is the code right okay perfect and now let's go to hard prompt version two and it has this additional information on the bottom right so let's take this and let's put it into the AI open a new chat make sure deep think is on and let it think again this can take a while okay so um see you [Music] soon all right do we have code or what yes we have some code let's copy it from here and let's put it over here let's click save and drum roll please okay we have coding errors because stochastic RSI is not defined like this again let's try to fix it by telling him what the problem is and then hopefully it knows what to do okay I got a phone call in between this recording so yeah let's continue on this and let's copy this error message here and also remember on which line the problem was 26 and go back to the AI and tell him I have an error online 26 and this is the error okay that's it let's see what it can do with this it's thinking again yeah so that will take some time as you are already used to okay we're getting some more code here actually it's more code than before which is good I guess so let's copy this and try it out Delete all of that put the new code in save it and okay cool we get a result no coding errors success right um the result is not the best right I mean the profit is not very high the draw down is okay but not when you compare with the profit in any case let's take a screenshot and update the diagram but hey it made it but with a little bit of help right so let's go back to the diagram and in the diagram we want to update the screenshot here and to to put the latest information in there and we want to compare of course how these results compare to the other AI results and see if they made more profit or had less draw down we'll see right so let's zoom in and remember it had 9% profit is not a lot 21% draw down okay right let's go here okay those were coding errors that I could not fix so this is fully screwed up and this was the other AI that was free right so unfortunately it's not really helping the other one made 70% with 30% draw down much better right so this is actually immediately better than the new one the Deep SE one 70 as well 30 that's actually interesting both of them created the same exact result when it comes to you know these two AIS CLA and Horizon AI let's see what open AI did 300% profit with 40% drone down I mean yeah the ratio is much better right I mean open AI wins right because best result and no coding errors but then you know deep seek is okay I would say but in this case it's not on place number two I would say that you know these guys here because they both created the same exact result right they are on place number two place number three on this very hard very very hard example here of how to create a strategy so overall deep seek is not the best one right but it's actually better than Gemini in the free version right and that's what matters because if you now know that you can take deep seek to create trading strategies and you don't need to pay anything for that and also you know that this is just the beginning Because deep seek came out is fully free it's actually open source right so people can take it and improve it right and you will see improvements every single month in my opinion so keep that in your mind and stay up to date right because this market and this kind of technology is moving very very fast okay of course we have to copy the code and update the document so that you have have access to all of this code as well after I put this video online oops I have to paste it like this all right so you have everything you need in this document the link is obviously down below yeah everyone can access you can see people are already accessing this because well I already have a video where I tested the other AIS and you can do the same right so if you find a new AI you don't really need to wait for my video okay that's why I'm teaching you all of this so just go here take the prompt right and then just you know put it in the AI that you want to test and see what happens because you have all the examples here already and you see the also the profit and the draw down in this video so you can compare and see did it do better or worse and also keep in mind and that's something that I really want to zoom in and and I want to make sure that you don't forget right so you have to try until you get a profitable result without coding errors right I mean don't expect it to work from the first try it doesn't make any sense this is AI okay it's a lot of probability when it when it thinks when it goes through its neural network right then it can take this path or that path right it's about probabilities so depends which words you're putting in your prompt and you know even if you try with the exact same prompt twice you might not get the same result right because the AI decided with random numbers right there are Randomness built into to that so that you you you know you have the chance to get better results next time so you have to try multiple times okay so try at least three times if you don't get a good result the first first time and don't give up right CU this is like talking to a human but it's an AI so a human will also not give you the exact same perfect answer every time right AI is the same so don't give up okay if you get coding errors don't give up if it doesn't work the first time just continue to do it right and come to our telegram group it's very helpful to be there right the link is down below because we have now five different moderators they are helping people 24/7 thank you very much for that by the way you're awesome all of you guys I will put you here on the screen these people will help you there also other members of telegram group will help you and everyone is like a big Collective creating strategies improving strategies learning from each other right so if you are interested in trading strategies automation right then this is the place to be right to watch this channel of course but to be in telegram because that's where we talk more right that we talk every day we answer people's questions we help people right also keep in mind that you have a big benefit because we have trading strategies here in Signum Signum is the automation software that we use right for automating all of these strategies and these two strategies are pretty powerful you can already use them out of the box you don't need to code anything and then also we have public strategies that are also good and we're going to add more strategies here into the list so you're going to have more and more strategies to experiment with to use on your crypto coins and so if you stay you know up to date first of all in my channel but also stay up to date what happens in Signum by being in the telegram group then you will not miss out on very good trading strategies that you can use for your yourself right so you have all the options in the world now right so you can create your own trading strategy with what I just showed you with completely free AI right you can join telegram to get help with that you can use Signum and have the free strategies already readymade strategies that you can start using right now okay I mean it doesn't get much easier than that so I hope you see the value and if that's the case then make sure to like this video massage the like button yes massage the like button and also subscribe to this freaking channel right because I add value to your life make sure to watch the playlist that is called Alo trading playlist Alo trading knowledge playlist this is basically a free course on algorithmic trading and strategies and automation it changed a lot of people's lives so it might change yours so check it out below share this video okay share this video so other people can also get the benefit they can learn they can do better right so they don't get screwed in the next bare market right they have good strategies they have automation so you see my passion for this is massive all right so make sure to share this help others as well and I see you in the next video and if you want to learn how to exactly automate the trading strategy then this is the next video you should [Music] watch yeah strates we know what to do yeah do yeah yeah stop L said watch the bus
