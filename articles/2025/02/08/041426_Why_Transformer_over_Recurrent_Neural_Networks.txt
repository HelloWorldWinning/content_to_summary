Description:
**Summary:**

**I. Problems with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):**

*   **A. Slow Processing:** RNNs process words sequentially, leading to longer processing times for longer sentences.
*   **B. Limited Contextual Understanding:**
    *   RNNs primarily learn from preceding words.
    *   Bi-directional RNNs concatenate left-to-right and right-to-left context, lacking true integrated understanding.

**II. Advantages of Transformers:**

*   **A. Parallel Processing:** Transformers process input words and generate word vectors in parallel, significantly speeding up training and inference.
*   **B. Improved Contextual Understanding:** The attention mechanism in Transformers facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of bidirectional context, resulting in better word vector representations.

**Core Point:** Transformers overcome the limitations of RNNs by enabling parallel processing and enhancing contextual understanding through the attention mechanism, leading to faster training/inference and improved word representations.

**Fundamental Point:** The shift from sequential processing in RNNs to parallel processing with attention in Transformers fundamentally improves efficiency and contextual comprehension in natural language processing.

**Overarching Framework:** Comparison of RNNs and Transformers, highlighting the shortcomings of RNNs in terms of speed and contextual understanding, and showcasing how Transformers address these issues through parallel processing and the attention mechanism.

why Transformers over recurrent neural networks rnns are slow to train and to infer this is because words are processed one at a time so longer sentences take longer time rnns also don't truly understand the context of a word normally these recurrent neural networks just learn from words that come before it but the context of a word depends on the words that come booked before and after it even bi-directional rnns suffer from this as it simply learns left right and right to left context separately and then concatenates them so it isn't learning the true meaning of the word Transformers can solve both problems they can take input words in parallel and the encoder can generate word vectors in parallel this can speed up processing training and inference also the attention mechanism can help learn bi-directional context in a more true sense so the word vectors that are generated after the encoder are so much more better at encapsulating the true meaning
