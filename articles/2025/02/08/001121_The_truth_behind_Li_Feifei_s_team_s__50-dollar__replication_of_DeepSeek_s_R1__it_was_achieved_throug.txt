When it comes to legendary figures in the investment world, the name of Warren Buffett, the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, is definitely unavoidable. $Berkshire Ha 今日有报道称李飞飞等斯坦福大学和华盛顿大学的研究人员以不到50美元的云计算费用，成功训练出了一个名为s1的人工智能推理模型。该模型在数学和编码能力测试中的表现，据称与OpenAI的O1和DeepSeek的R1等尖端推理模型不相上下。记者调查后发现，s1模型的训练并非从零开始，其基座模型为阿里通义千问（Qwen）模型。s1用50美元训练出新的具有推理能力的模型，实际上只是用从谷歌模型中提炼出来的1000个样本，然后对千问模型进行微调而成。 Today it was reported that researchers from Stanford University and the University of Washington, including Li Feifei, successfully trained an AI reasoning model named s1 with cloud computing costs of less than 50 dollars. The model's performance in mathematics and coding ability tests is reportedly comparable to cutting-edge reasoning models such as OpenAI's O1 and DeepSeek's R1. After investigation, it was found that the training of the s1 model did not start from scratch; its base model is Alibaba's Qwen model. The s1 model, trained for 50 dollars to create a new reasoning-capable model, was actually just fine-tuned from the Qwen model using 1000 samples extracted from the Google model.
