Description:
好的，我将为您总结并生成相应的概念图。

**总结要求：**

1.  **核心结论 (单句):** Transformer模型通过并行处理和注意力机制，克服了循环神经网络（RNN）在训练和推理速度以及上下文理解方面的局限性。
2.  **根本结论 (单句):** Transformer 的优势源于其并行处理能力和更有效的双向上下文学习方法，从而能够更快地训练和生成更具语义信息的词向量。
3.  **总体框架:**  内容对比了 Transformer 和 RNN，重点解释了 Transformer 在训练速度、推理速度和上下文理解方面的优势。

why Transformers over recurrent neural networks rnns are slow to train and to infer this is because words are processed one at a time so longer sentences take longer time rnns also don't truly understand the context of a word normally these recurrent neural networks just learn from words that come before it but the context of a word depends on the words that come booked before and after it even bi-directional rnns suffer from this as it simply learns left right and right to left context separately and then concatenates them so it isn't learning the true meaning of the word Transformers can solve both problems they can take input words in parallel and the encoder can generate word vectors in parallel this can speed up processing training and inference also the attention mechanism can help learn bi-directional context in a more true sense so the word vectors that are generated after the encoder are so much more better at encapsulating the true meaning
