Description:
Here's a structured summary of the provided text:

**1. Core Ideas:**

*   **Identifying Lies:** The text focuses on three signs to supposedly identify when a woman is lying.
*   **Sign 1: Over-Explanation:** Liars tend to provide excessive explanations instead of simple "yes" or "no" answers.
*   **Sign 2: Subject Change:** Liars avoid direct answers by changing the topic of conversation.
*   **Sign 3: Accusation Reversal:** Liars deflect by accusing the questioner of mistrust or disrespect.
*   **NLP Solution (Responsibility Reset):** The "Mastering Love" book suggests using NLP to address the situation by emphasizing the importance of honesty for building trust and calmly resolving misunderstandings.

**2. Core Point:**

Identifying lies is challenging, but recognizing specific behavioral patterns (over-explanation, subject change, accusation reversal) and addressing them with a calm, trust-focused approach can help.

**3. Overarching Framework:**

The content presents a framework for identifying potential deception, followed by a suggested approach to address the perceived dishonesty constructively. It is essentially a "problem-solution" framework applied to relationship communication.

**Simplified Chinese Response (If the original content was in Chinese, this is how the response would look):**

**1. 核心观点：**

*   **识别谎言：** 本文着重于识别女性说谎时可能出现的三个迹象。
*   **迹象 1：过度解释：** 说谎者倾向于提供过多的解释，而不是简单的“是”或“否”。
*   **迹象 2：转移话题：** 说谎者会通过转移话题来避免直接回答。
*   **迹象 3：反过来指责：** 说谎者会通过指责提问者不信任或不尊重来转移焦点。
*   **NLP 解决方案（责任重置）：** 《掌控爱情》一书中建议使用 NLP 来解决这种情况，强调诚实对建立信任的重要性，并冷静地解决误解。

**2. 核心结论：**

识别谎言具有挑战性，但识别特定的行为模式（过度解释、转移话题、反过来指责）并以冷静、信任为中心的方式解决这些模式会有所帮助。

**3. 总体框架：**

内容提出了一个识别潜在欺骗的框架，然后提出了一个建设性地解决感知的欺骗的方法。 本质上是将“问题-解决方案”框架应用于关系沟通。

Content:
 When women lie there are three signs, 99 pieces of men can't tell. First, if someone lies, they won't just say yes or no. Like if you ask, did you drink last night? She'll say no, I never drink before work. Truth tellers just say yes or no. Liars give reasons to make it sound real. Second, they change the subject. They avoid the main question by going off topic. Just stick to the original question. Tell her, I get you want to talk about B, but we need to agree on A first. Third, she might turn it around on you. She'll say you don't trust her or disrespect her. In my book Mastering Love, I said you can use the NLP Responsibility Reset. Tell her, building trust needs honesty. My questions are to clear up misunderstandings. Your anger shows this issue matters. We need to calmly sort it out.
