A possible ideal process is: working from 9 to 5 or 996 to get an increase in the bank card balance every month on "payday"; living a stable and ordinary life; getting promoted and developing, and luckily getting through the 35-year-old crisis; working in the same field day after day for 30 years until retirement; those who do well and have spare energy can develop a few side jobs for themselves to earn some "extra money". Although such a model can bring a certain sense of economic security, it is still far from the real freedom of wealth. Nawal believes that if you want to obtain financial freedom, the first thing you need to do is to understand the principles of wealth creation of ordinary people. Money and wealth are often confused by us, but in fact they are essentially different. Money is the reward we get for working hard and moving bricks every day. It can meet our daily expenses and short-term needs, but you can never get rich by renting out your time. Wealth is a more profound and lasting accumulation of assets. In Nawal's words, it means that after you sleep, it continues to create money for you, which is "post-sleep income. " Imagine if you own a house that you rent out and receive a stable rental income every month. This house is your wealth. You don't need to worry about it or take care of it every day. It can bring you a continuous cash flow. Or the link or "little yellow car" under your video can still earn commissions through the purchases of viewers even a long time after the video is released. "Survive within eight hours and develop outside eight hours" is an ideal state for ordinary people like us. In addition, knowledge, skills and even interpersonal relationships are all wealth. After understanding the principles of wealth creation for ordinary people, what we are most concerned about is how to get rich after removing the factor of luck? Nawal pointed out that the key to creating wealth is just six short words: "Productize yourself. " These 6 words contain two key points, one is "self" and the other is "productization". "Self" is not difficult to understand. It means finding your own uniqueness, expertise and sense of responsibility. If you want to make money, you must provide society with values ​​that are in demand but in short supply. "Productization" is a little more abstract. It means leveraging. What are the levers? For example, labor, capital, media, code, etc. We will talk about this in detail later. In summary, Nawal said that the core of wealth creation is "productizing yourself", which simply means finding your own expertise, cultivating a sense of responsibility, and then using the leverage effect to maximize your benefits. This process takes a long time, and this time is not used for execution. Instead, most of the time should be spent on thinking: What unique value can I provide? : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : Under the title of wealth in the first chapter of "Navar's Guide", there is a sentence "How to get rich without luck". Navar used a certain amount of space to analyze the matter of luck. He divided the ways to get good luck into 4 categories. The first is the most uncontrollable, unexpected "good luck". This kind of luck is like winning the lottery, which is completely random. The second kind of luck is the result of personal initiative. For a certain thing, some people choose to give up after trying the 100th time, but some people succeed at the 101st time. This kind of luck is to use hard work to exchange for the opportunity of success. The third way to get good luck is to be good at discovering good luck. In fact, this kind of discovery is essentially insight. When you are experienced and skilled in a field, you have a full understanding and experience. In this way, when a new window of opportunity appears, you will be more sensitive and one step ahead to make better and faster judgments and actions. The last and most rare one is to create a unique personality and mentality and let luck find you. When you are the best in a field, you don't need to go out to find opportunities. Luck will come to you on its own. After Navar's analysis, you may ask such questions: Is this still called luck? But the fact is that except for the uncontrollable situation of windfall, other luck does not come overnight. It requires growth and accumulation. Therefore, getting rich can never rely solely on "good luck". : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : How does this situation help me? The answer is usually obvious. When we realize that desire is the source of pain, we need to be sober and cautious about desire and abandon it appropriately. Charlie Munger once said: The first rule of a happy life is low expectations. We should remember this equation: Happiness equals what you have divided by what you expect. If you want to have a happy life, you need to learn to manage your expectations. In addition to desire, happiness has another enemy, which is jealousy. "I hope you live well, but not better than me", "Compared to failure, the success of friends is more heartbreaking", this sentence reveals the true thoughts of many people. Social comparison theory proposes that when we lack objectivity, we tend to evaluate our own value and status by comparing with others. In such a comparison, when others' advantages and treatment surpass our own, it will threaten our self-cognition and it is easy to feel jealous. When we were studying, we compared grades, after working, we compared jobs, after getting married, we competed for children, and even after retirement, we would inquire about how much other people's pensions were. We are like living in a multiplayer competitive game. Navar taught us a way: If you can exchange lives with the person you envy, would you be willing? Are you willing to accept not only all the aspects of the other person that you envy, but also all other aspects? : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :
