[Music] what's going on guys come inside what's up everybody Austin here and today I'm going to show you guys my state-of-the-art day trading office trade Club along with the setup that I use on a daily basis to day trade the Futures markets so excited to show you guys what we got going [Music] on so this is it guys this is trade club and my headquarters for all business operations and day trading activity uh this has been a revised video since the original walkthrough of trade club and just a day trading setup overview so figured I'd give you guys the refresh look not just of what I'm using to trade with but also the awesome place where I come to and call my office every single day so this is trade club guys we have everything that a Trader would need to succeed here you know we give them the hardware the monitors everything that you would need to come in and execute trade at a higher level we have amazing internet speeds here we have two service providers in case one goes down we have another backup so everybody stays connected all the machines are on battery backups if power goes out it's really the place to be if you are looking for that camaraderie that Community kind of like a Wei work for Traders so this is the trading floor this is where all the trading gets done by everybody else that's in here everyone's here is free to trade you know whatever they want everyone has different experience levels and different backgrounds so it's really a cool unique spot to connect Traders and overall just grow as a Trader not just mentally and with a community but also take advantage of pretty much the best technology on the market to get things done and then upstairs that is my personal setup uh where I come every single day and execute my Futures trades so this is just a little Quick Glance of the downstairs area got the lounge got the car trading floor the whole vibe is complete and uh now let's take a look upstairs and see what we got going on over there [Music] all right guys so we are upstairs this is where my personal setup is and we just really gave it a nice facelift since the last video and created a dope [Music] Vibe so this is it guys this is my day trading setup where I place all my orders on the Futures Market every single day do my analysis in live stream with the atg fam and uh let's just jump right into it so this is 53219 U monitors from Dell they're 4K display 32in all on Factory monitor stands you literally just tilt them flip them however you want horizontal or vertical and you just get the job done like there um but I will show you guys what we have kind of cooking on the screens and what all this information is used for and um just give you guys a little bit of an update so aside from just you know the monitors this is all powered by a custom Falcon uh trading PC so this PC is custom built for day trading it has like eight monitor display ports I'm only using five but I think it's more than enough um but I'll show you guys kind of what we got going on here all right guys so we're going to break down kind of what it is that I look at um on these five 32in screens um and everything pretty much serves a purpose so down below here we got the atg community on Discord that's where I just uh you know stay in contact with the atg community send the live streams out every morning um just kind of talk about what I'm doing for the day and uh above that we have Sierra charts that is where I'm actually executing my trades um that is where everything is pretty much taking place um besides the analysis so the analysis is what we have on the screen here this is just executions and Discord um and here we have a bunch of different windows up pretty much all of the same stuff though so this is uh Nasdaq futures here up top and then below we have the es S&P 500 futures and then just sitting above there on these three um horizontal charts is Apple Amazon Microsoft I mainly trade NASDAQ so I need to know what it is um you know that built builds up the index that I'm trading how it's moving if it's coming into any important levels that gives me some good information to kind of pair with this chart here so it all flows in together um up top here we have Nasdaq futures with a linear regression Channel um just on a 1 minute time frame and then we have uh again another really low time frame NASDAQ chart right next to the vix above that we got Nasdaq futures again on a higher time frame just with some levels here we're just trading in this range so it's nice to be able to look at things from a zoomed out perspective on the same screen that you're looking at it on an intraday perspective as well so it just kind of lets you know where you are sitting um in terms of an environment on a higher time frame as you come into the trading session or into a new week or anything like that next as well some more higher time frame charts that is what this screen is made up of it's all analysis um for intraday decision- making and intraday trading uh I do day trade futures I don't hold any positions overnight uh so this is the main screen that I'm giving a lot of attention to and then I just manage all the orders and talk to the atg fam down below so it's a really nice operation on that screen here sitting to the right we have a bid assk Delta chart these are volume bars on the NASDAQ and the es and this is like a visual uh sense of order flow a visual tape uh we got some cumulative Delta there on the bottom very very useful screen whenever trades actually are getting executed to see um inner market participations then above that just a trading view screen where I test out some of the tools um you know that I've been developing for a while and this is where I kind of just use those as a reference for one of the alos that I run it will identify setups on that screen there and then also send a Alert in the Discord whenever it pops up so if a alert is being fired there I want to check why it's firing the alert make sure it's good to go um but I also use that as a reference in my trading to confirm the validity um or existence of a particular trading setup so very very useful screen but not as heavily relied upon as the one here in the middle this is all um you know the nuts and bolts of what I'm using for my decision- making process intraday but that's just a great confirmation and a way for me to double check what's popping out in the Discord now moving on to the screen here we have daily charts so daily charts and tweet deck this is where I'm able to kind of assess what's going on in the session from a fundamental standpoint see any type of u news articles that are coming out any economic data releases well I'll pop out on this screen through tweet deck and I also kind of just double check and see if anything's going to be coming out uh through this economic calendar here I use the myfxbook economic calendar just what I've always used for a really long time and is really really quick I've used the market watch one I've even paid for some in the past but I think for a really uh you know cheap option that works phenomenally and is very very on point I would definitely recommend that one over some of the other uh ones out there that you know are much more expensive gets the job done phenomenally and by no means is a step down from any type of calendar either it's very very effective as well so mainly tweet deck though is on there uh throughout the day and then I use the daily charts and my pre-market plans and uh just to kind of see where we are on the higher time frames so got a whole bunch of stuff on here key levels channels just a good way for me to reference you know what type of environment we're in if any obstacles are coming up on the downside or the upside I'm able to see if anything could potentially impact price direction for the new session so important screen there um and then to the left of that this is the final screen this is where I have my algo running I'm able to watch its performance and we can see it had some executions here so I pay attention to that on this screen and then above is a multi hour chart it's a 2-hour chart uh for Nasdaq features so I mainly trade NQ the NASDAQ features and this is where I'm paying attention to 24-Hour uh session profiles and U key levels so I also have like a Channel or two there but nothing you know that's overlapping like this chart just like you know one that's very recent and could potentially be in play so that's what I use that for and sitting above that is the Daniels trading features uh position size calculator I'm able to do mental math I know roughly what my trades are going to cost me when I put them on from a risk perspective but it's always good to double check and make sure you know exactly how much each position uh carries worth of risk so that's what I have going on on that chart there very very useful and this is all a functional setup all this stuff helps me in its own way and I don't really need uh you know to essentially do anything else or move any Windows all these kind of just remain here constantly and give me bits and pieces of information that I'm able to use to make better trading decisions so when I'm on the go I usually just have trading View and Sierra charts up maybe one little uh window for Blue Water Trader but I don't really look at many uh other things you know besides tweet deck just to see if anything's popping out but usually on the go I'll have different tabs for everything but since we have all the screen real estate I'm really able to spread it out and just be able to glance at it whenever I need so don't have to worry about switching tabs or anything everything is pretty much here to stay and um it runs absolutely without a hiccup thanks to this PC it's it's actually it's a beast so this is the setup that I use on a daily basis guys hope this provided a nice little inside look at what I use to you know to to make happen in the market but this is it this is the spot and um if you have any questions comments about any of the hardware we got going on here feel free to drop it in the comment section give it a a look and give you my opinion uh if possible but this is uh you know been a great setup I'd recommend it to anybody that's looking uh to really upgrade their setup or use uh you know a very capable setup got all the monitors here beautiful clean crisp displays and I actually got this from the homie mic so shout out to him but great great great computer um and yeah this is it guys so hope you enjoyed this little overview of the setup here um it's been absolutely uh you know Flawless and I continue or I look forward to continue using um this in the future and then even upgrading it as technology gets better and better but I think I'm good with the screens for now um the PC so far state-ofthe-art everything's good love it no complaints
