Description:
**核心观点:**
Rust凭借其编译时内存安全、并发保障和现代化包管理系统，正逐渐成为系统编程的未来，而C++将主要聚焦于维护现有的大量遗留代码。

**总框架:**
本文通过比较Rust和C++在系统编程领域的相似性与关键差异（包括内存管理、并发安全、包管理、生态系统和宏系统），探讨了两种语言的优劣及其未来发展趋势。

---

### **总结大纲**

**I. 引言：Rust与C++的共同点**
    A. 均为系统编程语言，适用于底层（如操作系统内核、固件）到高级（如游戏、Web应用）开发。
    B. 均不使用垃圾回收机制，代码更具可预测性、效率更高。

**II. Rust的显著优势与创新**
    A. **内存安全保障**
        1.  **C++的挑战：** 虽有智能指针缓解，但内存相关错误（如段错误、未定义行为）风险仍存，保证有限。
        2.  **Rust的解决方案：** 引入“借用检查器”（Borrow Checker），在编译时确保引用不会超出其指向数据的生命周期，从根本上杜绝大量内存安全漏洞。
    B. **并发安全与数据竞争预防**
        1.  Rust通过其丰富的类型系统（包含Sync和Send特性），在编译时检查多线程操作的安全性。
        2.  编译器会阻止不安全的数据共享或变异，强制要求使用同步原语（如Mutex）来安全地在多线程间修改共享变量，有效预防数据竞争。
    C. **“安全Rust”与“不安全Rust”**
        1.  **安全Rust：** 提供内存安全和无未定义行为的强大保证。
        2.  **不安全Rust：** 允许开发者绕过安全检查，主要用于：
            *   与操作系统或硬件进行底层交互（这些操作本质上不安全）。
            *   在编译器过于保守时，开发者确信操作正确，并需优化性能。
        3.  **与C++的对比：** 不安全Rust在功能上与C++有相似之处，但Rust社区强烈建议最小化不安全代码的使用，显著减少了内存问题的发生面。
    D. **包管理系统：Cargo**
        1.  Rust拥有官方且易用的包管理器Cargo，简化了依赖管理和项目构建，体验现代化。
        2.  C++：外部库管理复杂，缺乏统一标准，现有尝试（如Conan、vcpkg）远不及Cargo便捷。
    E. **强大且安全的宏系统**
        1.  **卫生宏：** 类似于C/C++宏，但能避免命名冲突和意外的副作用。
        2.  **过程宏：** 更强大，可作为编译器插件在编译时直接操作程序的语法树，实现代码生成、注解等高级功能。

**III. C++的当前优势与挑战**
    A. **庞大的生态系统与库资源**
        1.  C++：凭借数十年发展，拥有比Rust庞大得多的库生态，在许多特定领域仍无可替代。
        2.  Rust：生态系统相对较小，但通过良好的外部函数接口（FFI）可以轻松与C代码互操作，从而间接利用C++库（通过C API）。
        3.  有项目（如Google Chrome团队的Odo CXX）正尝试简化Rust与C++之间的绑定。

**IV. 未来展望**
    A. **Rust：** 被认为是系统编程的未来，微软、谷歌、苹果等大公司正逐步将其整合到产品中。
    B. **C++：** 绝不会消亡，其庞大的遗留代码基础确保其在未来很长一段时间内依然重要。
    C. **趋势预测：** 未来十年，C++的工作可能更多集中于维护现有软件，而Rust将主导新产品的开发。

 Rust versus C++, which is better and why. This question comes up a lot lately, especially when considering whether learning Rust is worth it or not. And so I thought it could be a wonderful opportunity to make a new video, discussing the differences between the two, as well as what they share in common. So without further ado, let's dive right into it. Both Rust and C++ are system programming languages, which means they can be used to write low-level code like operating system kernels, as well as firmware for microcontrollers. But compared with C, they offer a lot of abstractions that make it possible to go high level as well, for example, writing games and web applications. Another similarity between C++ and Rust is that neither of them uses a garbage collector to manage memory, which makes the code much more predictable, efficient, and in many cases, faster. Of course, if you ever use C, you will know that managing memory yourself is hard. Besides the cognitive overhead, you're also running the risk of causing segmentation faults and undefined behaviors. For this reason, modern C++ introduced concepts like smart pointers as a way to mitigate those memory-related bugs. But despite the significant improvements, they are limited in the number of guarantees they can offer. Rust takes it a step further and introduces the concept of Borrow Checker, a component bundled within the compiler itself that makes sure that a reference does not outlive the data they refer to, preventing entire classes of memory and safety bugs. Another big selling point for Rust is its rich type system, which makes it possible to prevent data races at compile time. It does so by introducing two special traits, Sync and Send, which are used by the compiler to determine whether a multi-threaded operation is safe or not. And while sharing some memory between threads is possible in Rust, the compiler will stop you from building a program that does so unsafely, preventing data races even before the program starts. So for example, if you want to mutate a variable from multiple threads, the compiler will require you to wrap it with a mutex or something equivalent, because in general, mutating an unsynchronized variable from multiple threads is unsafe, unless a synchronization primitive or atomic operations are used. Up to this point, we discussed the features of the so-called safe Rust, which provides guarantees like memory safety and prevents undefined behavior. But there is also another version of the language known as unsafe Rust, which basically gives you superpowers at the price of losing all those safety guarantees. Are you wondering why this is needed? Well, there are mainly two reasons. If you want to interact with the low-level aspects of the operating system or hardware, those operations are inherently unsafe. So the safe Rust compiler, which is the one that tries to give you guarantees, is not able to do so. Therefore, if you still want to execute them, you will have to explicitly tell the compiler to trust you and give up those safety guarantees, entering the unsafe side of Rust. The other reason is that when analyzing the code, the compiler is very conservative. From a guarantees point of view, it's much better to block a valid program than to make an incorrect one pass the compilation step. Thus, there are times in which we might want to bypass those checks, and in order to do so, we need to enter the unsafe side of Rust as well. In a way, unsafe Rust and C++ are very similar. The main difference is that Rust programmers usually avoid the unsafe side as much as possible, unless interfacing with the low-level aspects of the operating system, or when absolutely certain that an operation is correct. And this greatly reduces the surface for memory problems. An area in which Rust is arguably better than C++ is package management. If you have ever worked with Python or JavaScript, you will feel right at home with Cargo, the official package manager for Rust. Installing a package is just a matter of adding a line into the dependency files, whereas in C++, using an external library can be a huge pain, especially if targeting multiple operating systems. There are some attempts to bring modern package management to C++, such as Conan and VC package, but they are far from being standardized or easy to use as Cargo. With that being said, the C++ ecosystem is huge, much bigger than the Rust counterpart, as the former has been around for multiple decades. As a result, there are many more libraries for C++, and thus, there might be cases in which a suitable library is not available for a specific task when working with Rust. The good news is that Rust has a very good foreign function interface, which means you can interface with C code very easily from Rust, and thus also interface with C++ libraries by exposing a C API from them. Unfortunately, this is not always possible, especially in complex cases. There are some ongoing attempts to make it easier to create bindings between the two. An example is the Odo CXX library, which is being developed by the Google Chrome team to investigate whether parts of the browser could be developed in Rust in the future. Another interesting difference between the two languages is the macro system, which in Rust is much more powerful and safer. First of all, Rust ships with two kinds of macros, the Clarity and Procedural. The former type is similar to the traditional C and C++ macros, with the difference that macros are hygienic, meaning they cannot interfere with variables outside their scope, and therefore don't cause any unwanted side effects. On the other hand, procedural macros are completely different, much more powerful and also complex. They can be basically thought of as compiler plugins that receive the program syntax tree as input, manipulate it, and then return the enriched syntax tree as an output. This makes it possible to create annotations, similarly to Java, that enrich the code at compile time. To conclude, which of the two languages is better? As always, it depends, but these are the most important takeaways. Rust is likely the future of system programming, and the proof is that many of the big players, such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple, are moving in that direction, gradually integrating Rust with their products. Don't get me wrong, C++ is far from being dead, and it's not going away anytime soon, due to the incredibly vast amount of legacy code built with it, but an increasing number of companies are choosing Rust over C++ for new products. My theory is that in 10 years time, most C++ jobs would be focused on maintaining legacy software rather than creating new products. But of course, that's only my opinion, and I might be wrong. With that being said, thank you very much for watching, I hope you liked the video. If you did, please consider leaving a like and subscribing to the channel, and I hope to see you in the next one.
