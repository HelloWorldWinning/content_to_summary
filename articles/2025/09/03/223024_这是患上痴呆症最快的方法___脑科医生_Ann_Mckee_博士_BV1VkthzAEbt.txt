## 总结

### 1. 核心观点

这段对话强调了大脑健康是一个整体性的概念，指出生活方式选择在预防阿尔茨海默病等神经退行性疾病中扮演着关键角色，同时管理接触性运动的风险也至关重要。

### 2. 总体框架

理解神经退行性疾病：病因、预防策略与风险管理。

### 3. 大纲化总结

1.  **痴呆症与阿尔茨海默病的区别**
    *   **痴呆症**：是一个广义术语，指心智能力（认知）的丧失。
    *   **阿尔茨海默病**：是痴呆症最常见的病因，尤其与年龄相关的痴呆症。
    *   **其他痴呆症类型**：包括路易体病型帕金森病、额颞叶变性、进行性核上性麻痹和慢性创伤性脑病（CTE）等。
2.  **如何预防或减轻阿尔茨海默病症状**
    *   **增强认知储备和大脑韧性**：保持社交活跃，持续挑战和锻炼大脑。
    *   **保持身体健康**：进行体育锻炼，维持良好的心血管健康。
    *   **健康饮食与血糖控制**：饮食均衡，避免高血糖和糖尿病。
    *   **保证充足优质睡眠**：睡眠是清除大脑有害物质的关键过程。
3.  **酒精对大脑健康的影响**
    *   酒精以不同于阿尔茨海默病或CTE的方式损害大脑。
    *   虽然与阿尔茨海默病没有直接联系，但长期饮酒不利于大脑健康，可能加重认知症状。
4.  **对脑部疾病认知的提升**
    *   神经退行性疾病的发病率不一定在增加，但社会对其的认识和重视程度显著提高。
    *   这些疾病被视为“异常老化”或“病理性老化”，而非正常衰老过程。
5.  **关于大脑疾病的关键理论（专家观点）**
    *   **炎症**：是脑部疾病和神经退行性变的关键促进因素，阿尔茨海默病和CTE中存在大量炎症。
    *   **小血管疾病**：大脑中微小血管的健康至关重要，其损伤会加速疾病进程。
    *   **早期关注**：血管变化和炎症是疾病最早期的改变，需要更多关注。
6.  **导致脑部炎症和血管损伤的因素**
    *   任何对大脑的损伤。
    *   **血管损伤**：导致血脑屏障渗漏，有害物质进入大脑引发炎症。
    *   **创伤**：尤其是头部创伤，如脑震荡。
    *   **不良生活习惯**：高血压、高胆固醇、高血糖（糖尿病）。
    *   **压力**：导致皮质醇水平升高，也可能影响血管健康和炎症反应。
7.  **给接触性运动儿童家长的建议**
    *   **评估孩子需求**：思考孩子是否必须参与接触性运动，或是否能从非接触性运动中获得同等快乐。
    *   **优先选择**：推广非接触性或低风险运动。
    *   **风险管理**：若选择接触性运动，确保教练充分了解脑震荡及其后果，对球员、队友和教练进行良好教育。
    *   **延迟参与**：尽可能延迟参与全面接触性运动，直到孩子身体强壮，颈部肌肉发达，能更好地抵抗冲击。

 You mentioned that you've looked at lots of brains of people that have Alzheimer's, bit of a dumb question, but what is the difference between Alzheimer's and dementia, or is it the same thing? Yeah, it's a great question because everybody's confused. So, dementia is sort of this general term. It's dementia, which means the loss of your mental abilities, you know, de-mentating. So, loss of cognition, cognitive abilities, dementia. There are many subcategories of dementia, causes of dementia. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. It's the most common age-related cause of dementia. But then, under Alzheimer's, there's also Parkinson's disease with Lewy body disease. There's something called frontotemporal low bar degeneration. Then there's, you know, you get into otter and rare diseases, progressive superl nuclear palsy, chlamine and dementia. And somewhere down there is also CTE. So, CTE is a cause of dementia. Okay. And how do I avoid getting Alzheimer's? Well, you know, it's a very common disease. It's supposedly in over 50% of people that live to the age of 85. If you looked at their brains, half of them would have Alzheimer's disease. Not everyone gets the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease at 85, but they'd have the pathology. Now, things you can do to lessen the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are, you know, staying socially connected, using your brain, challenging your brain, because high cognitive reserve, high cognitive ability gives you strength, brain strength, brain resilience against these diseases. So even if you have pathology, you can circumvent the areas of injury, the areas that aren't working well, and not experience the symptoms. So that's one thing. You know, physical activity, fitness, but also mental fitness, challenging your brain, keeping an active, developing a high cognitive reserve. And then the other things you can do is, you know, stay fit, eat right. Cardiovascular health is intimately connected to Alzheimer's disease. You want to avoid high blood sugar, diabetes, because that can definitely hasten Alzheimer's disease. So it's really a story of staying healthy. Alcohol? Well, alcohol can damage your brain and alcohol damages it in entirely different ways than Alzheimer's or CTE. But if you do drink alcohol, it can exacerbate your symptoms. It can make your symptoms worse. And, you know, we don't have any direct connection between alcohol and Alzheimer's. But, you know, we do know that it's not good for your brain health. It damages parts of the brain that can lead to cognitive problems. All these diseases are increasing. No, I think our awareness of these diseases is increasing. You know how we used to call it senile dementia? Like, oh, yeah, he's just getting old. So, you know, we sort of dismissed it as just old age. But there are some people that lived to very old ages that are perfectly intact. So these are abnormal aging. These are pathological aging. And we're much more aware of it than we were, say, 40 years ago. 40 years ago, we really had no concept how common this disease was. Is there anything that you believe about the brain that most people disagree with? Still to this day? I can't think so. As it relates to Alzheimer's and CTE, it's only sort of fundamental beliefs that you're currently trying to prove out through your testing and the things you're doing at Boston University. Well, I do. I have my own theories. I don't know if other people don't believe them. But I do feel that inflammation, anything that causes inflammation in your brain, and I think what a lot of people would agree with me. The inflammation is one of the key promoters of brain disease and neurodegeneration. So there's tremendous inflammation in Alzheimer's disease, tremendous inflammation in CTE. And if we could figure out sort of this bad inflammation, we might be able to prevent or at least stave off these terrible diseases. And the other thing that I think is very important is small vessel disease, vascular disease. The health of these small blood vessels that are so important to in terms of giving oxygenating our brain, if they become damaged or injured through a variety of mechanisms, then we also see these diseases being accelerated. So I think there needs to be a lot more attention to the earliest changes that are associated with these diseases. And in my mind, those are vascular changes and inflammation. And what kinds of things cause inflammation in the brain? Really any insult to the brain, certainly if the blood vessels are damaged and they become leaky, you get substances leaking into the brain that irritate the brain and cause tremendous inflammation. The brain blood brain barrier is a very tight barrier. You can have all sorts of toxins in your blood, but they're not getting into your brain because you have such a tight barrier between the blood and the brain. We keep out all sorts of noxious substances. But if you injure the blood vessels, they leak and all those things that we are trying to keep out of our brain, leak into the brain, and promote inflammation, those changes can facilitate neurodegeneration. And the things that may cause those blood vessels become injured. Well, trauma, that back and forth, but also things that affect vascular health, like high blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, exactly. High cortisol. Yeah. Yeah. Leetune for stress, I guess. Stress, you want to reduce stress, you want to stay physically fit, you want to eat, right? We all know that what you need to do is just the things that sleep, you know, sleep is so important because at the end of the day, you're asleep. You're actually clearing bad substances out of your brain. You have a clearance system in your brain that is most active when you sleep. And so, when you're sleeping, it's pulling out the noxious chemicals, it's draining them into your system, so you can get rid of them. So sleep is also critically important. We probably have a few million parents listening at the moment, this conversation. And those parents, you know, their kids are saying, I want to play rugby, I want to play soccer, I want to play American football, I want to do hockey, all these kinds of things. What would you say to those parents? Well, you know, every parent is different, every child's different. You have to really understand your child. Is it that they need to play that particular sport? Or could they be as just as easily, you know, could they be just as happy in a non-contact sport? There are plenty of non-contact sport, there are plenty of sports that have low risk. So I would promote all of those. And then if they're playing, they choose, if they think, you know, this is a decision that they want to make despite the risks, then, you know, make sure the coach is very, very well, you know, versed in some of the adverse consequences of concussions and those hits to the head, even the non-concussive hits. Make sure that there's good education, good education of the player, as well as the teammates, as well as the coach. And then, you know, try to delay playing full contact as long as possible. I think you should delay it until the person's physically robust, with a musculature, with a strong neck, they're able to, you know, resist hits. There's, you know, a blindsided hit is much more damaging than a hit that you're expecting because you set your neck, you're expecting the hit, and it doesn't cause the whiplash that a blindsided hit caused.
