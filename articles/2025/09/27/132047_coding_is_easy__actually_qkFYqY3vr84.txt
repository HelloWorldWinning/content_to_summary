成为一名熟练的程序员需要经历一个实用的三步过程：即刻开始学习，通过实际项目积累经验，并最终为技术面试做好准备，其中实践经验远比理论痴迷更为关键。

**Overarching Framework**

成为熟练程序员的三步实用路线图

**详细大纲**

1.  **引言**
    *   编程的巨大价值：代码能够创造巨额财富，AI技术进一步放大其影响力。
    *   纠正误区：市场上充斥着由初学者提供的、过于复杂且不切实际的编程建议。
    *   核心主张：真正的学习需要坐下来亲自动手，本文旨在提供一个清晰、简化的学习路径。

2.  **第一步：立即开始 ("Just Start")**
    *   成功的前提：所有成功的程序员都曾迈出第一步。
    *   免费自学资源：推荐 `Roadmap.sh` 网站，提供涵盖前端、后端、网络安全等多种技术领域的详细学习路线图。
    *   结构化学习选择：
        *   传统学位教育。
        *   训练营（Bootcamp）。
        *   **特别推荐**本视频赞助商 `Triple Ten`：
            *   优势：为初学者提供必要的技能，确保获得高薪科技工作。
            *   涵盖领域：软件工程、数据科学、网络安全等。
            *   特色：实习机会、项目经验、导师指导、代码审查和职业辅导。
            *   结果：87%的毕业生在六个月内找到工作，并提供10个月内未就业全额退款保证。
            *   优惠：使用代码 `easy` 可享30%折扣，最高节省3400美元。
    *   编程语言：不应执着于精通某一种语言，先从 `Python` 入手，一旦掌握一种，其他语言的学习会变得相对容易。

3.  **第二步：动手实践 ("Make Stuff")**
    *   避免理论陷阱：不必深入学习路线图上的所有理论知识，关键在于通过实践积累经验。
    *   学习模式的转变：从“教程地狱”阶段（被动观看）迈向“项目天堂”（主动创造）。
    *   实践方法：
        *   利用所学知识构建自己感兴趣的实际项目（例如，制作一个计算高压清洗车道费用的网站）。
        *   初期项目可能远比想象中复杂，会遇到挫折，但完成第一个项目是重要的里程碑。
        *   通过谷歌搜索、阅读他人代码、复制粘贴等方式解决问题。
    *   推荐资源：`Roadmap.sh` 网站的项目区，提供项目指南而非直接解决方案，鼓励独立思考和实践。
    *   心态调整：编程技能的提升是一个循序渐进的过程，不要因他人知识广度而气馁。

4.  **第三步：应对 `LeetCode` 挑战 ("LeetCode Limbo")**
    *   求职的必经之路：对于申请顶级科技公司而言，`LeetCode` 能力是不可或缺的“秘密握手”。
    *   练习内容：专注于数据结构和算法（如数组、哈希表、树等）。
    *   学习策略：
        *   将练习分散在几个月内，避免短期内大量刷题。
        *   理解这是评估编程能力的一种方式。
    *   鼓励：每个人都曾从最基础的问题开始，不要被高难度问题吓倒。

5.  **总结**

 I used to think it wasn't worth it to learn how to code until I realized that there were pieces of code out there that make more money per minute than I ever will in my lifetime. In fact, I can bet you that in the time you took to brush your teeth this morning, somewhere out there, some piece of code triggered a program to sell a few stock options and make some unknown Wall Street investment firm a couple million USD in profit. The truth is, if you know how to code, you can run laps around everyone else that doesn't, and if you learn how to use AI to help you, you can run even faster laps. But one thing is for sure, you actually have to sit down and learn how to code. Luckily, I'm going to save you from having to sift through all the overcomplicated advice on the internet, written by first your computer science students who took one intro to CS course, and then went on to buy this MacBook, this hoodie, these headphones, these laptop stickers, this coffee mug, and this iPhone to take late night pictures of their VS code setup. Of course, with only one line inside the actual code editor. Step 1, instead of listening to them, just start, because it's a well-known fact that 100% of successful programmers have at some point started. Crazy isn't it? If you have no money to start out and you want to learn slowly by yourself over a long period of time, I recommend this free website called Roadmap.sh. It's the first thing that comes up when you google coding Roadmap. For pretty much every technology world you can think of, like front-end, back-end, full stack, cyber security, and for pretty much every niche skill like system design, API design, and AWS, you get a solid road map which you can use to at least start learning. But if you're more of a structured learner who learns better with a solid curriculum, assignments, and support, you could get a degree, or you could jump into a bootcamp. Nowadays, a lot of companies don't really care if you have a degree, as long as you're good at building stuff and you have experience. And by the way, if you want a more affordable and reliable path to a high-paying, flexible tech job that doesn't take up four years of your life and a huge student loan, you would especially benefit from this video's sponsor, Triple Ten. Triple Ten helps literally anyone, even complete beginners, gain all the necessary skills to get placed into a high-paying tech job. You can pick from software engineering, data science, cyber security, and a bunch more. But the reason why I recommend them is because they give you extra-ship opportunities, they give you project experience, tutors, coaches, code reviews, and career help. Stuff that the average self-taught learner doesn't have access to, and I'm not saying the job market is bad, but this is what the average computer science student looks like nowadays after graduating, once they realized that 14 minutes of studying per week probably wasn't enough. So when I see that 87% of Triple Ten grads get hired within six months of completion, that's enough to convince me that something is working here. You can get a tech education and actually have a job to show for it. You can do the whole thing online remotely, on your own time, even if you have a busy schedule. And on top of that, they guarantee that if you won't find a job within 10 months of finishing the course, you'll get 100% of your money back. Plus, if you use the code easy, you'll get 30% off on all of their courses and can save up to $3,400 on your education. So don't hesitate to click the link in the description or scan the QR code for a free career consultation. But anyway, let's go back to looking at the self-taught road map. Whatever you do, do not obsess over mastering a programming language. Programming languages are pretty easy to learn, and once you know one language, it doesn't take a whole lot of effort to learn other ones. Some are strongly typed, meaning you have to bench press at least 200 pounds to use them. Other languages are weakly typed, like JavaScript, because weak people use it. Sometimes the syntax is different. Some languages have faster performance in certain use cases. Some languages are easier for beginners. Some languages are used by only one company, and meant to be run on a specific type of machine. Some languages shouldn't exist. Some languages are low level, meaning they're harder for humans to understand, but easier for machines to read. And other languages are high level, meaning they're easy for humans to understand, but they give you a little bit less control over the actual machine. But yeah, just learn Python. You'll notice that the roadmaps they give you are pretty long and pretty detailed. But I'm gonna be honest, no actual developer needs to have deep knowledge about all of these topics, and you shouldn't try to do everything on the roadmap. That's like trying to learn how to make grilled cheese by reading a book on bread and a separate book on cheese. At some point, it's just faster to make the thing and see what happens. Experience is what you need. But the nice thing about this website is that it always gives you somewhere to start. No nonsense, no fluff, no filler, no watching thousands of videos called if I wanted to be a thoughtful engineer in 2079, here's what I would know. All you need to do is start on the roadmap, learn some of the stuff in the yellow boxes, maybe take a course or two and read a couple articles and watch a couple videos, and then immediately move on to step two, make stuff. Think to yourself, how can I use what I just learned to make something that I actually want to make? For example, if you're a beginner in web development and you really like pressure watching driveways, then guess what? You can make a website where a user can input how big their driveway is, the surface type, and where they live, and it'll estimate how much they would have to pay to get a pressure washed. It sounds simple, but I guarantee you it'll be way more complicated than you expect. You'll have to look up pretty much everything and you will 100% be tempted to give up halfway through when your eyes are getting dry, your posture is deteriorating into freeform shapes, and the backs of your thighs are sticking to your chair. But ask anyone who's actually gotten good at coding and they'll tell you, once you can get that first project done, you have now ascended from what's known as tutorial hell into the far superior project heaven, which is where all the accomplished developers live and grieve. Just look at Neil.fun. This collection of little mini-games was made by a college student practicing coding, and if you look at the first couple of websites he made many years ago, they're pretty basic, something a beginner can make in a few days. But when you look at the newer ones, it's pretty easy to tell that its coding skills got a little bit more advanced, and you can do the exact same thing as long as you put in the time and don't give up, even when business school starts to look real tempting. One big reason you might feel disappointed in yourself when you first start learning to code is because everyone else seems to know way more than you, and they talk about concepts you don't even know exist as if they're common sense. Sometimes you'll hear your favorite coding youtubers talking about API calls and weird systems, and acronyms, and niche technologies and protocols that just make no sense, because none of those things show up in an 8-hour Python for beginners YouTube tutorial. And although it may seem like some people were born knowing how to set up servers and backend databases and web sockets and how to create bots out of thin air, it's really just a gradual learning process that takes a long time. You probably won't learn this stuff in school, you probably won't see it in textbooks, and it probably won't get recommended on your YouTube homepage, but you will learn it through projects and googling and reading people's code and copying and pasting other people's code until you've created a fully functional final product. You won't become a programming expert slogging through 11-hour YouTube tutorials back to back to back. At the same time, one big issue is that everyone tells you to just build projects you're passionate about, but what if you're not passionate about anything? What if you're just coding to pay the bills and your only hobby is watching YouTube? Luckily, there's an easy solution. Hover over to the top left menu of this website and click on projects. Based on whatever language you know or whatever skill you're trying to practice, they have actual useful projects that you can test your skills with. And the best part is that they give you general guidelines on what to make, how to put your project on a GitHub, and where to find help. But unlike most places, they don't just give you the solution. Unlike a YouTube tutorial where you're just watching someone build a project and then copying down every single line of code one by one, this forces you to actually learn. And if you can't find a good project on this website, don't overthink it. Just start. Just do Google search and pick whatever sounds the most fun. By now, you may be thinking, if tutorial hell is step one and project-based heaven is step two, then what's step three? Lead code limbo. If you don't know, lead code is website where you can practice staring at a computer screen with a coding problem and not understanding anything for weeks in a row. Unless you're applying to a company where you're the firstborn child of the CEO, you're going to have to accept that the code is law. When you're applying to a top tech company, being good at solving lead code problems is like a secret handshake between you and your interviewer. There's a secret handshake that existed all companies. They want you to be able to jump through a set of hoops to show that you are good enough to be there. And so we don't have like a really good way to gauge how good someone actually is at coding in 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 50 minutes. So instead it's like, hey, you come in here. I'm going to do that secret handshake. You better have done 300 lead code problems. You've done 300 lead code problems. You walk in, you know how to use arrays, maps, sets, you understand trees. We just know that you can do all the things. Now, is it the best way to test people? Probably not. There's no best way to grind lead code. You can find many roadmaps for lead code online. And ideally, you would space it out over at least a few months instead of trying to do 75 problems in a week. But the important thing is you just have to do it. It might be intimidating to see people on YouTube coding up solutions to lead code hards before you've even finished reading the problem. But it's important to know that everyone once started by solving two sum in O of N squared. And if all else fails, you can just tell yourself McDonald's is a new meta. Anyway, if that helped, I'm collecting donations in the form of subscribes to fund the next video.
