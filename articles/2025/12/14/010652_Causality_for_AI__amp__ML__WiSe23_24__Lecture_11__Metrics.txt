Description:
好的，这是根据您提供的文本内容精心提炼的摘要、框架、核心观点和概念图。

### **内容核心思想摘要**

#### **一、 引言：为何及如何“度量”因果关系**

*   **基本概念**：首先回顾了数学中“度量（Metric）”的严格定义（满足非负性、同一性、对称性、三角不等式），并说明在因果科学中，“距离”或“分数”的用法可能更宽泛，不一定严格满足所有度量公理。
*   **核心任务**：本次讲座的目标是介绍三种前沿方法，用于**量化（Quantify）**因果结构或因果表征之间的相似性与差异性，重点在于如何从不同层面捕捉“因果”的内涵。

#### **二、 论文一：基于证据与反事实的图相似性度量**

*   **背景**：比较两个给定的因果图（DAGs）有多相似。
*   **1. 证据距离 (Evidential Distance, ED)**
    *   **层面**：统计/观测层面。
    *   **方法**：计算两个图所蕴含的**条件独立性集合**的对称差。它衡量的是两个图在“数据证据”层面的一致性。
    *   **关键特性**：当且仅当两个图属于同一个**马尔可夫等价类**时，它们的证据距离为零。这为判定马尔可夫等价提供了一个计算工具。
*   **2. 反事实距离 (Counterfactual Distance, CD)**
    *   **层面**：因果/干预层面。
    *   **方法**：计算两个图所蕴含的**因果优先关系**（哪个变量是哪个变量的（直接或间接）原因）集合的对称差。
    *   **作用**：能够区分那些在观测上等价（ED=0）但在因果结构上不同的图。
*   **3. 组合与应用**
    *   通过对 ED 和 CD 进行加权平均，可以综合评估两个图在统计和因果两个维度上的相似度。

#### **三、 论文二：结构干预距离 (SID)**

*   **背景**：同样是比较因果图，但侧重于它们在“干预”下的功能性后果。
*   **1. 基准：结构汉明距离 (Structural Hamming Distance, SHD)**
    *   **方法**：一个简单的、非因果的度量，仅计算两个图之间**边的差异数量**（例如，边的增/删/反向）。
    *   **局限**：对因果影响的严重性不敏感。一条无关紧要的边的改变和一条核心因果路径的改变，SHD 可能都记为1。
*   **2. 核心：结构干预距离 (Structural Intervention Distance, SID)**
    *   **方法**：计算在两个图中，使得**干预分布的推断结果不一致**的变量对（(i, j)）的数量。换言之，它衡量的是“如果我相信图A，对变量i进行干预后j的分布是什么？”与“如果我相信图B...”这两个问题的答案有多少个是不同的。
    *   **关键洞察**：SID 更能捕捉因果差异的**功能性重要性**。一个微小的结构变化（低SHD）可能导致巨大的干预后果差异（高SID），反之亦然。SID 因此成为评估因果发现算法更具意义的指标。

#### **四、 论文三：干预鲁棒性分数 (IRS)**

*   **背景**：从比较“已知”图结构转向评估机器学习模型（特别是深度学习）所学到的**隐变量表示**的因果性质，尤其是在**解耦（Disentanglement）**任务中。
*   **1. 核心概念：解耦因果过程 (DCPs)**
    *   假设存在一组独立的、现实世界中的**生成因子**（如物体的颜色、形状、位置），它们共同导致了我们观测到的高维数据（如图像）。
*   **2. 构建模块：干预后分歧 (Post-Interventional Disagreement, PIDA)**
    *   衡量当对一个生成因子（如颜色）进行干预时，再额外干预另一个因子（如形状），模型学习到的某个隐变量（特征）会发生多大变化。
*   **3. 最终度量：干预鲁棒性分数 (Interventional Robustness Score, IRS)**
    *   基于 PIDA 构建的、归一化到 [0, 1] 区间的评估分数。
    *   它量化了一个学习到的特征在多大程度上能够**鲁棒地、独立地**表征某一个生成因子，而不受其他生成因子变化（即干预）的影响。
    *   **应用与价值**：实验表明，使用 IRS 训练的模型能学习到更清晰、更独立的因果表征，效果优于互信息（MI）等传统的非因果关联性度量。

### **核心结论点**

为了有效量化和比较因果结构，必须超越表面的统计或结构差异，采用基于干预或反事实的度量标准，因为它们能更深刻地揭示因果机制的功能性后果。

---

### **内容 overarching framework**

本次讲座介绍的三种因果度量方法遵循一个共同的递进框架：

1.  **定义一个基准度量**：首先引入一个较为简单、通常基于**统计关联**或**表面结构**的度量方法（如 ED、SHD、互信息MI）。
2.  **引入因果视角**：接着，提出一个更复杂的、核心的度量方法，该方法明确地基于**干预（Intervention）**或**反事实（Counterfactual）**推理。
3.  **展示优越性**：最后，通过实例或理论分析证明，这种基于因果的度量能够捕捉到基准度量所忽略的关键信息，从而更准确、更有意义地评估因果关系或因果表征的质量。

finally we get the triangle in equality, finally we get the triangle in equality, finally we get the triangle in equality, inequality which is um if we have now, inequality which is um if we have now, inequality which is um if we have now, this third Point l in here then the, this third Point l in here then the, this third Point l in here then the, distance from M to L is going to be, distance from M to L is going to be, distance from M to L is going to be, bounded by the sum of the distance from, bounded by the sum of the distance from, bounded by the sum of the distance from, M to n and then n to L right and that, M to n and then n to L right and that, M to n and then n to L right and that, essentially forms a triangle right so if, essentially forms a triangle right so if, essentially forms

typically it's the, ukian distance right so if we have um X, ukian distance right so if we have um X, ukian distance right so if we have um X, XY and we compare two points point which, XY and we compare two points point which, XY and we compare two points point which, have both of these Dimensions so we have, have both of these Dimensions so we have, have both of these Dimensions so we have, X1 X2 y1 and Y2 then we simply look at, X1 X2 y1 and Y2 then we simply look at, X1 X2 y1 and Y2 then we simply look at, the square difference here take the sum, the square difference here take the

the moment yeah and so we want to, capture this notion of how similar to, capture this notion of how similar to, capture this notion of how similar to, graphs are right so that's going to be, graphs are right so that's going to be, graphs are right so that's going to be, our distance we're going to define a, our distance we're going to define a, our distance we're going to define a, distance a metric on on graphs on on, distance a metric on on graphs on on, distance a metric on on graphs on on, graph pairs but before we can do that or, graph pairs but before we can do that or, graph pairs but before we can do that or, that's what the authors did and I think, that's what the authors did and I think, that's what the authors did and I think, it makes a lot of sense is to ask the, it makes a lot of sense is to ask the, it makes a lot of sense is to ask the, question what information is really, question what information is really, question what information is really, already contained in a graphical, already contained in a graphical, already contained in a graphical, representation of a CM model that we, representation of a CM model that we, representation of a CM model that we, could use to develop our, could use to develop our, could use to develop our, metric so um let's start simple so here, metric so um let's start simple so here, metric so um let's start simple so here, we have just uh three variables and I'm, we have just uh three variables and I'm, we have just uh three variables and I'm, actually just keeping an abstract here, actually just keeping an abstract here, actually just keeping an abstract here, so HD and I think of it as whatever you, so HD and I think of it as whatever you, so HD and I think of it as whatever you, want h be height and D could be diet of, want h be height and D could be diet of, want h be height and D could be diet of, a person or something I don't know what, a person or something I don't know what, a person or something I don't know what, i is and in this example um if this was, i is and in this example um if this was, i is and in this example um if this was, the true causal structure now right so, the true causal structure now right so, the true causal structure now right so, so we have this causal Edge from D to I, so we have this causal Edge from D to I, so we have this causal Edge from D to I, and then no Edge from H to any of the, and then no Edge from H to any of the, and then no Edge from H to any of the, nodes then H and D should really be, nodes then H and D should really be, nodes then H and D should really be, probabilistic in independent right, probabilistic in independent right, probabilistic in independent right, that's what this graph is telling us if, that's what this graph is telling us if, that's what this graph is telling us if, it's a true graph because there should, it's a true graph because there should, it's a true graph because there should, be no correlation between the respective, be no correlation between the respective, be no correlation between the respective, values of two variables when there's, values of two variables when there's, values of two variables when there's, absolutely no cause of relationships in, absolutely no cause of relationships in, absolutely no cause of relationships in, the sense saying that to have causation, the sense saying that to have causation, the sense saying that to have causation, you need correlation but not the other, you need correlation but not the other, you need correlation but not the other, way around right like if you have, way around right like if you have, way around right like if you have, correlation it doesn't imply causation, correlation it doesn't imply causation, correlation it doesn't imply causation, and so that's really what you can read, and so that's really what you can read, and so that's really what you can read, off just from this graph if you know, off just from this graph if you know, off just from this graph if you know, this the causal graph and in fact if you, this the causal graph and in fact if you, this the causal graph and in fact if you, know this the true graph obviously these,

typically what, we have is this you know causal Mark of, we have is this you know causal Mark of, we have is this you know causal Mark of, condition right there's a lot of these, condition right there's a lot of these, condition right there's a lot of these, names we have seen this in very early, names we have seen this in very early, names we have seen this in very early, lectures uh so if we have these two, lectures uh so if we have these two, lectures uh so if we have these two, graphs G and G G Star then both would, graphs G and G G Star then both would, graphs G and G G Star then both would, imply that H is problemistic independent, imply that H is problemistic independent, imply that H is problemistic independent, of both D and I I right so there's no, of both D and I I right so there's no, of both D and I I right so there's no, connection whatsoever there cannot be, connection whatsoever there cannot be, connection whatsoever there cannot be, even a correlation up up to

there's information, there's an edge there's information, there's an edge there's information, flowing and what we call this typically, flowing and what we call this typically, flowing and what we call this typically, is Mark of equivalent right like we, is Mark of equivalent right like we, is Mark of equivalent right like we, cannot just with observational data, cannot just with observational

class, yeah okay so we have seen now a single, yeah okay so we have seen now a single, graph what it can reveal now if you look, graph what it can reveal now if you look, graph what it can reveal now if you look, at multiple graphs in tandem what they, at multiple graphs in tandem what they, at multiple graphs in tandem what they, can reveal and with this we are going to, can reveal and with this we are going to, can reveal and with this we are going to, start with our first distance measure of, start with our first distance measure of, start with our first distance measure of, the day this is what the authors call, the day this is what the authors call, the day this is what the authors call, the evidential distance so here's the, the evidential distance so here's the, the evidential distance so here's the, definition we have a variable set we fix, definition we have a variable set we fix, definition we have a variable set we fix, it right it's it's it's v v bold here, it right it's it's it's v v bold here, it right it's it's it's v v bold here, and then NP is going to denote the size, and then NP is going to denote the size, and then NP is going to denote the size, the

and so on and so, forth then this evidential distance, forth then this evidential distance, forth then this evidential distance, right so we have just seen that graphs, right so we have just seen that graphs, right so we have just seen that graphs, describe these evidential relationships, describe these evidential relationships, describe these evidential relationships, then we can define an evidential, then we can define an evidential, then we can define an evidential, distance as this function de here which, distance as this function de here which, distance as this function de here which, takes the two graphs that we're looking, takes the two graphs that we're looking, takes the two graphs that we're looking, at as an input and is evaluated as this, at as an input and is

relationships that we, evidential Rel relationships that we, evidential Rel relationships that we, just talked about so to give an example, just talked about so to give an example, just talked about so to give an example, here the distance on two graphs is going, here the distance on two graphs is going, here the distance on two graphs is going, to be exactly zero if and only if they, to be exactly zero if and only if they, to be exactly zero if and only if they, are in the same Mark of equivalence, are in the same Mark of equivalence, are in the same Mark of equivalence, class so if we just remember two slides, class so if we just remember two slides, class so if we just remember two slides, back we had the two graphs where we had, back we had the two graphs where we had, back we had the two graphs where we had, the same variables we had the same, the same variables we had the same, the same variables we had the same, number of edges but the edges were just, number of edges but the edges were just, number of edges but the edges were just, reversed right and they are part of the, reversed right and they are part of the, reversed right and they are part of the, same Mark

distance going to be zero, evidential distance going to be zero, right and that's what we mean really the, right and that's what we mean really the, right and that's what we mean really the, Ed should be a tool for characterizing, Ed should be a tool for characterizing, Ed should be a tool for characterizing, for capturing the fact that you know, for capturing the fact that you know, for capturing

about the mark of equivalence, talked about the mark of equivalence, class but now you can just take two, class but now you can just take two, class but now you can just take two, graphs put it into this very simple, graphs put it into this very simple, graphs put it into this very simple, formula and if it's zero you can for, formula and if it's zero you can for, formula and if it's zero you can

right but any, the same mark to L Glass right but any, graph you get I think that's pretty cool, graph you get I think that's pretty cool, graph you get I think that's pretty cool, but now um let's also do an example on, but now um let's also do an example on, but now um let's also do an example on, on just how to uh you know get these, on just how to uh you know get these, on just how to uh you know get these, numbers right and so on the left here, numbers right and so on the left here, numbers right and so on the left here, now we have a table where we're looking, now we have a table where we're looking, now we have a table where we're looking, for three different graphs right these, for three different graphs right these, for three different graphs right these, are going to be different graphs from, are going to be different graphs from, are going to be different graphs from, what we saw before so G1 is going to be, what we saw before so G1 is going to be, what we saw before so G1 is going to be, XY z a chain pointed from X to Z then, XY z a chain pointed from X to Z then, XY z a chain pointed from X to Z then, we're going to have the fork on y so y, we're going to have the fork on y so y, we're going to have the fork on y so y, pointing to X and to Z and then we have, pointing to X and to Z and then we have, pointing to X and to Z and then we have, the the Collider as we know obviously, the the Collider as we know obviously, the the Collider as we know obviously, from you know desparation and all these, from you know desparation and all these, from you know desparation and all these, things uh these two graphs fall in the, things uh these two graphs fall in the, things uh these two graphs fall in the, same category the colliders always, same category the colliders always, same category the colliders always, separate and actually this we also see, separate and actually this we also see, separate and actually this we also see, if we evaluate the distances so if you, if we evaluate the distances so if you, if we evaluate the distances so if you, look at G1 and G2 same Mark of, look at G1 and G2 same Mark of, look at G1 and G2 same Mark of, equivalence class it's zero but if we, equivalence class it's zero but if we, equivalence class it's zero but if we, look at G2 to G3 or G1 to G3 they behave, look at G2 to G3 or G1 to G3 they behave, look at G2 to G3 or G1 to G3 they behave, the same way but they are both different, the same way but they are both different, the same way but they are both different, right they in different Mark for GL test, right they in different Mark for GL test, right they in different Mark for GL test, and relates to one over three right so, and relates to one over three right so, and relates to one over three right so, the three would be all the possibil, the three would be all the possibil, the three would be all the possibil, and and one would be just uh what you, and and one would be just uh what you, and and one would be just uh what you, get out here and essentially you can, get out here and essentially you can, get out here and essentially you can, just derive this from this table right, just derive this from this table right, just derive this from this table right, you look at X being inde theend of Y, you look at X being inde theend of Y, you look at X being

um, yeah now this was just evidential things, yeah now this was just evidential things, yeah now this was just evidential things, right this is nothing that hello um this, right this is nothing that hello um this, right this is nothing that hello um this, is nothing that we have not nothing that, is nothing that we have not nothing that, is nothing that we have not nothing that, is causal per se right so this was just, is causal per se right so this was just, is causal per se right so this was just, the statistical part of it right but now, the statistical part of it right but now, the statistical part of it right but now, let's look at how we can generate more, let's look at how we can generate more, let's look at how we can generate more, insights from the graph so here we're, insights from the graph so here we're, insights from the graph so here we're, taking a a third example we are having, taking a a third example we are having, taking a a third example we are having, this graph bttf TR and PC here's the, this graph bttf TR and PC here's the, this graph bttf TR and PC here's the, little Legend right this is kind of a, little Legend right this is kind of a, little

reading will be correct or whatever the, reading will be correct or whatever the, reading will be correct or whatever the, reading actually would be and then you, reading actually would be and then you, reading actually would be and then you, know a pill consumption maybe if you, know a pill consumption maybe if you, know a pill consumption maybe if you, know you're trying to reduce fever, know you're trying to reduce fever, know you're trying to reduce fever, because the reading is actually showing, because the reading is actually showing, because the reading is actually showing, that it's

referring to is that really these are, referring to is that really these are, the causes of for example TR and TR is, the causes of for example TR and TR is, the causes of for example TR and TR is, the cause of PC they receding in the, the cause of PC they receding in the, the cause of PC they receding in the, order right and if I were to change one, order right and if I were to change one, order right and if I were to change one, of these variables counterfactually then, of these variables counterfactually then, of these variables counterfactually then, uh this would be the order I'm getting, uh this would be the order I'm getting, uh this would be the order I'm getting, and so what we can get out of this is, and so what we can get out of this is, and so what we can get out of this is, that BT and TF you know directly preced, that BT and TF you know directly preced, that BT and TF you know directly preced, TR and so on and so forth so our, TR and so on and so forth so our, TR and so on and so forth so our, evidential distance just covered these, evidential distance just covered these, evidential distance just covered these, evidential relationships but now we want, evidential relationships but now we want, evidential relationships but now we want, to also have something for these, to also have something for these, to also have something for these, counterfactual dependencies again don't, counterfactual dependencies again don't, counterfactual dependencies again don't, think of the pean sense now in the sense, think of the pean sense now in the sense, think of

doing interventions think of it only, and doing interventions think of it only, now as as the the parent causes, now as as the the parent causes, now as as the the parent causes, really and so to extend our example now, really and so to extend our example now, really and so to extend our example now, let's look at two graphs right because, let's look at two graphs right because, let's look at two graphs right because, we're always comparing graphs now we are, we're always comparing graphs now we are, we're always comparing graphs now we are, trying to quantify the similarity and so, trying to quantify the similarity and so, trying to quantify the similarity and so, I just copied the same graph and added, I just copied the same graph and added, I just copied the same graph and added, this Arrow here so an arrrow which, this Arrow here so an arrrow which, this Arrow here so an arrrow which, directly goes from BT to PC and now, directly goes from BT to PC and now, directly goes from BT to PC and now, here's the interesting observation I, here's the interesting observation I, here's the interesting observation I, added this Arrow but on the contactual, added this Arrow but on the contactual, added this Arrow but on the contactual, note there's no difference these two, note there's no difference these two, note there's no difference these two, graphs are equivalent why because the, graphs are equivalent why because the, graphs are equivalent why because the, information that you know BT is, information that you know BT is, information that you know BT is, preceding PC is mediated via this TR, preceding PC is mediated via this TR, preceding PC is mediated via this TR, node and because it's mediated it was, node and because it's mediated it was, node and because it's mediated it was, already part of our ordering right so it, already part of our ordering right so it, already part of our ordering right so it, doesn't give give you any more, doesn't give give you any more, doesn't give give you any more, information so we can claim that they in, information so we can claim that they in, information so we can claim that they in, that regard equivalent similar to how, that regard equivalent similar to how, that regard equivalent similar to how, the evidential relationship was, the evidential relationship was, the evidential relationship was, capturing something about the mark of, capturing something about the mark of, capturing something about the mark of, equivalence and how graphs could be, equivalence and how graphs could be, equivalence and how graphs could be, equivalent there and so let's try to, equivalent there and so let's try to, equivalent there and so let's try to, characterize this mathematically now so, characterize this mathematically now so, characterize this mathematically now so, this is where we introduce now the, this is where we introduce now the, this is where we introduce now the, counterfactual distance and it's going, counterfactual distance and it's going, counterfactual distance and it's going, to be also apparent why we used the, to be also apparent why we used the, to be also apparent why we used the, before because it's going to have a very, before because it's going to have a very, before because it's going to have a very, similar structure so we again fix our, similar structure so we again fix our, similar structure so we again fix our, variable set our uh endogenous variables, variable set our uh endogenous variables, variable set our uh endogenous variables, V and now we are going to denote not by, V and now we are going to denote not by, V and now we are going to denote not by, NP but by NC simply the size the, NP but by NC simply the size the, NP but by NC simply the size the, cardinality of all possible, cardinality of all possible, cardinality of all possible, counterfactual independencies Right like, counterfactual independencies Right like, counterfactual independencies Right like, these uh precedings that we just saw um, these uh precedings that we just saw um, these uh precedings that we just saw um, that could hold in principle in all, that could hold in principle in all, that could hold in principle in all, those variables of V now given a CA, those variables of V now given a CA, those variables of V now given a CA, structure G CG is going to denote what, structure G CG is going to denote what, structure G CG is going to denote what, is entailed by this graph and again the, is entailed by this graph and again the, is entailed by this graph and again the, causal Mark of condition then we can, causal Mark of condition then we can, causal Mark of condition then we can, simply Define CD equivalently to or, simply Define CD equivalently to or, simply Define CD equivalently to or, analogously to Ed as the symmetric, analogously to Ed as the symmetric, analogously to Ed as the symmetric, difference between the sizes of these, difference between the sizes of these, difference between the sizes of these, two uh parameters of the graphs and then, two uh parameters of the graphs and then, two uh parameters of the graphs and then, divided or normalized again over all, divided or normalized again over all, divided or normalized again over all, possible of these contaction inde, possible of these contaction inde, possible of these contaction inde, dependencies so again super simple, dependencies so again super simple, dependencies so again super simple, formula structurally speaking right if, formula structurally speaking right if, formula structurally speaking right if, we were to take a category Theory point, we were to take a category Theory point, we were to take a category Theory point, of view these are very much the same, of view these are very much the same, of view these are very much the same, they describe different things right, they describe different things right, they describe different things right, counterfactuals versus evidence and and, counterfactuals versus evidence and and, counterfactuals versus evidence and and, this one obviously is then causal, this one obviously is then causal, this one obviously is then causal, because it considers interventions and, because it considers interventions and, because it considers interventions and, things like that but ultimately the, things like that but ultimately the, things like that but ultimately the, formula ends up being the same so so you, formula ends up being the same so so you, formula ends up being the same so so you, learn two formulas for the price of one, learn two formulas for the price of one, learn two formulas for the price of one, and I think that's a good, and I think that's a good, and I think that's a good, deal so the example again we are, deal so the example again we are, deal so the example again we are, plotting the same table really again, plotting the same table really again, plotting the same table really again, also for the same graphs so we are, also for the same graphs so we are, also for the same graphs so we are, keeping the the chain the fork and the, keeping the the chain the fork and the, keeping the the chain the fork and the, collider but now we're looking at these, collider but now we're looking at these, collider but now we're looking at these, ordering relations which is really just, ordering relations which is really just, ordering relations which is really just, the direct cause of the other, the direct cause of the other, the direct cause of the other, essentially or or apparent cause a root, essentially or or apparent cause a root, essentially or or apparent cause a root, cause and so here we just marking this, cause and so here we just marking this, cause and so here we just marking this, for example X is preceding Y in this, for example X is preceding Y in this, for example X is preceding Y in this, graph right in in G1 uh in G3 but not in, graph right in in G1 uh in G3 but not in, graph right in in G1 uh in G3 but not in, G2 because it would be a vector and this, G2 because it would be a vector and this, G2 because it would be a vector and this, you can do for all of these rows and, you can do for all of these rows and, you can do for all of these rows and, then it is not hard to show that if you, then it is not hard to show that if you, then it is not hard to show that if you, look now at G1 and G2 that's going to be, look now at G1 and G2 that's going to be, look now at G1 and G2 that's going to be, the same as G1 and G3 and they are both, the same as G1 and G3 and they are both, the same as G1 and G3 and they are both, nonzero and they are both a half in this, nonzero and they are both a half in this, nonzero and they are both a half in this, case so here we have now a separation of, case so here we have now a separation of, case so here we have now a separation of, the graphs G1 and G2 previously they, the graphs G1 and G2 previously they, the graphs G1 and G2 previously they, were treated the same because they ended, were treated the same because they ended, were treated the same because they ended, up being in the same Mark of equivalence, up being in the same Mark of equivalence, up being in the same Mark of equivalence, class because this is what we wanted but, class because this is what we wanted but, class because this is what we wanted but, here counteract speaking they're, here counteract speaking they're, here counteract speaking they're, actually different G1 and G3 are more, actually different G1 and G3 are more, actually different G1 and G3 are more, similar now and so this is what we, similar now and so this is what we, similar now and so this is what we, really see now in this formulation right, really see now in this formulation right, really see now in this formulation right, and again simple formula and we can, and again simple formula and we can, and again simple formula and we can, somehow quantify causality, somehow quantify causality, somehow quantify causality, yes yes of, course yes it's it's sorry it's not, course yes it's it's sorry it's not, factual it's a typo yeah I'll just, factual it's a typo yeah I'll just, factual it's a typo yeah I'll just, correct it thank, correct it thank, correct it thank, you mhm, you mhm, you mhm, anything else so we have seen Ed now and, anything else so we have seen Ed now and, anything else so we have seen Ed now and, CD and next really I want to somehow, CD and next really I want to somehow, CD and next really I want to somehow, compare them, the so the distance is just a function, the so the distance is just a function, in this case defined on the set of all, in this case defined on the set of all, in this case defined on the set of all, of the graphs which means that you take, of the graphs which means that you take, of the graphs which means that you take, as input two graphs right and then what, as input two graphs right and then what, as input two graphs right and then what, it captures what this formulation, it captures what this formulation, it captures what this formulation, specifically captures is at the zero, specifically captures is at the zero, specifically captures is at the zero, point the graphs which are part of the, point the graphs which are part of the, point the graphs which are part of the, same Mark of equivalence class so it's a, same Mark of equivalence class so it's a, same Mark of equivalence class so it's a, characterization of the mro equivalence, CL when I look at graph one of the, CL when I look at graph one of the, graphs first and then the other doesn't, graphs first and then the other doesn't, graphs first and then the other doesn't, matter right I can just reverse, [Music], [Music], that uhhuh, that uhhuh, that uhhuh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I this one no no no the first, I this one no no no the first, I this one no no no the first, um, um, um, yeah the first point our distance of a, yeah the first point our distance of a, yeah the first point our distance of a, point to itself uh I think that's just, yeah but wait like I mean one graph the, yeah but wait like I mean one graph the, same graph is in the same Maric fence, same graph is in the same Maric fence, same graph is in the same Maric fence, test, right oh you're oh you're saying because, right oh you're oh you're saying because, ah the always positive thing yeah yeah, ah the always positive thing yeah yeah, ah the always positive thing yeah yeah, yeah oh yeah that's actually correct, yeah oh yeah that's actually correct, yeah oh yeah that's actually correct, yeah um do the author's comment on, this okay so so I think now I'm playing, this okay so so I think now I'm playing, again the advocate of the authors, again the advocate of the authors, again the advocate of the authors, essentially right, essentially right, essentially right, um as I was putting here when you look, um as I was putting here when you look, um as I was putting here when you look, at the, at the, at the, literature metric and these things right, literature metric and these things right, literature metric and these things right, I mean these words get thrown around, I mean these words get thrown around, I mean these words get thrown around, sometimes right and so maybe the, sometimes right and so maybe the, sometimes right and so maybe the, author's interpretation of distance is, author's interpretation of distance is, author's interpretation of distance is, not that of a metric and then you don't, not that of a metric and then you don't, not that of a metric and then you don't, have to evaluate the second point which, have to evaluate the second point which, have to evaluate the second point which, is being uh always positive right and, is being uh always positive right and, is being uh always positive right and, then then you're fine and you can still, then then you're fine and you can still, then then you're fine and you can still, call it distance right if you say, call it distance right if you say, call it distance right if you say, distance is equal to metric then it's, distance is equal to metric then it's, distance is equal to metric then it's, then it would be a, yeah uhuh so this, yeah uhuh so this, one uhuh on the on the CD you, one uhuh on the on the CD you, one uhuh on the on the CD you, mean yeah well, possible, possible, POS independencies, POS independencies, POS independencies, independencies go exponentially the, independencies go exponentially the, independencies go exponentially the, number of but do we have any or do we, number of but do we have any or do we, number of but do we have any or do we, assume that the number, assume that the number, assume that the number, of, so what are you trying to get at I don't, so what are you trying to get at I don't, see where the question part, yes oh you're just asking the question, yes oh you're just asking the question, whether the number of counterfactual, whether the number of counterfactual, whether the number of counterfactual, growth exponentially, growth exponentially, growth exponentially, within any oh, okay, okay, number so okay so so you're saying it's, number so okay so so you're saying it's, number so okay so so you're saying it's, a fact we know that conditional, a fact we know that conditional, a fact we know that conditional, dependencies grow as sure and now you're, dependencies grow as sure and now you're, dependencies grow as sure and now you're, asking whether it also applies to, asking whether it also applies to, asking whether it also applies to, confects no I ask this, confects no I ask this, confects no I ask this, appes, appes, appes, so, have can someone help me with the, have can someone help me with the, question I really don't get the, yeah same, yeah same, when no I think The Rao actually goes, when no I think The Rao actually goes, when no I think The Rao actually goes, down because the, number oh so so you oh so so you want to, number oh so so you oh so so you want to, understand, understand, understand, okay so so wait when

the ratio and and what what is growing, the ratio and and what what is growing, faster yeah oh that you're trying to ask, faster yeah oh that you're trying to ask, faster yeah oh that you're trying to ask, okay, okay, okay, um do we know anything about this Mo you, um do we know anything about this Mo you, um do we know anything about this Mo you, Al invited to think about, Al invited to think about, Al invited to think about, [Music], more to get graphs are super exponential, more to get graphs are super exponential, so I think the the ratio would you know, so I think the the ratio would

just the number of all, here is um really just the number of all, here is um really just the number of all, the edges possible in in in v v is, the edges possible in in in v v is, the edges possible in in in v v is, shared obviously between these graphs, shared obviously between these graphs, shared obviously between these graphs, which satisfy the edge type condition, which satisfy the edge type condition, which satisfy the edge type condition, and what is the edge type Condition it's, and what is the edge type Condition it's, and what is the edge type Condition it's, really just saying that they do not have, really just saying that they do not have, really just saying that they do not have, the same type of edge between I and J, the same type of edge between I and J, the same type of

right and so not the, have directed edges right and so not the, same Edge time then we count, same Edge time then we count, same Edge time then we count, this so let's make an example as we, this so let's make an example as we, this so let's make an example as we, always do so in the top you can see the, always do so in the top you can see the, always do so in the top you can see the, true graph we have what five five nodes, true graph we have what five five nodes, true graph we have what five five nodes, X1 X2 and then y1 to Y3 and now we have, X1 X2 and then y1 to Y3 and now we have, X1 X2 and then y1 to Y3 and now we have, two modified graphs right so we have one, two modified graphs right so we have one, two modified graphs right so we have one, graph where we add an edge between y1, graph where we add an edge between y1, graph where we add an edge between y1, and Y2 so G is a subset and we have here, and Y2 so G is a subset and we have here, and Y2 so G is a subset and we have here, where we reverse the edge between X2 and, where we reverse the edge between X2 and, where we reverse the edge between X2 and, X1 everything else stays the same Al, X1 everything else stays the

and we do this typically with for, um and we do this typically with for, um and we do this typically with for, example adjustment sets right so X and Y, example adjustment sets right so X and Y, example adjustment sets right so X and Y, are two different nodes in our graph G, are two different nodes in our graph G, are two different nodes in our graph G, now we can differentiate two cases Y

look at an example again, intuition let's look at an example again, so here we have the graphs we have seen, so here we have the graphs we have seen, so here we have the graphs we have seen, previously I've just taken the two now, previously I've just taken the two now, previously I've just taken the two now, so the original graph and the modified, so the original graph and the modified, so the original graph and the modified, one where we have the additional Edge, one where we have the additional Edge, one where we have the additional Edge, between Y and, between Y and, between Y and, Y2 so shd was one here right because, Y2 so shd was one here right because, Y2 so shd was one here right because, just this one edge here what we going to, just this one edge here what we going

distances looked similar but you know, distances looked similar but you know, distances looked similar but you know, they're checking for different things so, they're checking for different things so, they're checking for different things so, of course we expect different things and, of course we expect different things and, of course we expect different things and, so now how do we go about checking this, so now how do we go about checking this, so now how do we go about checking this, and verifying this so obviously they, and verifying this so obviously they, and verifying this so obviously they, have implemented an algorithm of this, have implemented an algorithm of this, have implemented an algorithm of this, and and it works and it's nice um, and and it works and it's nice um, and and it works and it's nice um, checking this manually even for for, checking this manually even for for, checking this manually even for for, small graphs like this is already very, small graphs like this is already very, small graphs like this is already very, tedious right so we're just going to do, tedious right so we're just going to do, tedious right so we're just going to do, one part um also because here we have, one part um also because here we have, one part um also because here we have, the subset graph it goes a lot quicker, the subset graph it goes a lot quicker, the subset graph it goes a lot quicker, so all nodes uh except for Y2 have the, so all nodes uh except for Y2 have the, so all nodes uh except for Y2 have the, same parents between the graphs right so, same parents between the graphs right so, same parents between the graphs right so, this we can verify so they have the same, this we can verify so they have the same, this we can verify so they have the same, adjustment and and there we are already, adjustment and and there we are already, adjustment and and there we are already, done right in that sense it's just, done right in that sense it's just, done right in that sense it's just, identical so what we now need to do is, identical so what we now need to do is, identical so what we now need to do is, we need to focus on Y 2 and essentially, we need to focus on Y 2 and essentially, we need to focus on Y 2 and essentially, any of the other nodes whether it agrees, any of the other nodes whether it agrees, any of the other nodes whether it agrees, on the intervention level across the, on the intervention level across the, on the intervention level across the, graphs and so let's do this we have, graphs and so let's do this we have, graphs and so let's do this we have, three cases to cover so on this slide we, three cases to cover so on this slide we, three cases to cover so on this slide we, have case one and two you have as a, have case one and two you have as a, have case one and two you have as a, reminder the graphs X1 and X2 are, reminder the graphs X1 and X2 are, reminder the graphs X1 and X2 are, parents of Y2 in both of the graphs, parents of Y2 in both of the graphs, parents of Y2 in both of the graphs, right so in that sense check we we we, right so in that sense check we we we, right so in that sense check we we we, have uh the Interventional agreement as, have uh the Interventional agreement as, have uh the Interventional agreement as, well because the parents are the same, well because the parents are the same, well because the parents are the same, and the the adjustment will work out, and the the adjustment will work out, and the the adjustment will work out, with at those now in h however we have, with at those now in h however we have, with at those now in h however we have, this additional Edge right uh of of y1, this additional Edge right uh of of y1, this additional Edge right uh of of y1, so so what we now need to check is this, so so what we now need to check is this, so so what we now need to check is this, thing here right so if we intervene on, thing here right so if we intervene on, thing here right so if we intervene on, Y2 how does Y3 behave and specifically, Y2 how does Y3 behave and specifically, Y2 how does Y3 behave and specifically, we're going to check this adjustment set, we're going to check this adjustment set, we're going to check this adjustment set, now X1 and X2 are the same plus y1 and, now X1 and X2 are the same plus y1 and, now X1 and X2 are the same plus y1 and, we don't need to go now in detail into, we don't need to go now in detail into, we don't need to go now in detail into, this derivation but really it starts, this derivation but really it starts, this derivation but really it starts, here at H1 at this graph right we are, here at H1 at this graph right we are, here at H1 at this graph right we are, trying to check for this causal effect, trying to check for this causal effect, trying to check for this causal effect, here it ends up in the other graph with, here it ends up in the other graph with, here it ends up in the other graph with, the same causal effect though and here, the same causal effect though and here, the same causal effect though and here, we have the transition happening and how, we have the transition happening and how, we have the transition happening and how, is the transition happen happening you, is the transition happen happening you, is the transition happen happening you, can see for example that we are, can see for example that we are, can see for example that we are, introducing those here we can do that, introducing those here we can do that, introducing those here we can do that, because well we are just marginalizing, because well we are just marginalizing, because well we are just marginalizing, over them um then we are uh rewriting, over them um then we are uh rewriting, over them um then we are uh rewriting, this here in terms of joint distribution, this here in terms of joint distribution, this here in terms of joint distribution, and conditional uh then we are dropping, and conditional uh then we are dropping, and conditional uh then we are dropping, some things because we know that there's, some things because we know that there's, some things because we know that there's, an, an, an, independence um and then we really, independence um and then we really, independence um and then we really, already have this final transition going, already have this final transition going, already have this final transition going, to here yeah again we're not going to, to here yeah again we're not going to, to here yeah again we're not going to, explain this now in detail if if if, explain this now in detail if if if, explain this now in detail if if if, you're interested let's do this offline, you're interested let's do this offline, you're interested let's do this offline, in the interest of time let's move on um, in the interest of time let's move on um, in the interest of time let's move on um, and then the final case so so we have, and then the final case so so we have, and then the final case so so we have, seen X1 X2 we have seen uh y y 3, seen X1 X2 we have seen uh y y 3, seen X1 X2 we have seen uh y y 3, essentially and now we want to also do, essentially and now we want to also do, essentially and now we want to also do, y1 right so we want to check y1 causal, y1 right so we want to check y1 causal, y1 right so we want to check y1 causal, effect if we change Y2 and here because, effect if we change Y2 and here because, effect if we change Y2 and here because, we know that y1 and Y2 are

I want to do next is look a little bit, I want to do next is look a little bit, I want to do next is look a little bit, into some of these properties of s right, into some of these properties of s right, into some of these properties of s right, because it seems to be a very, because it seems to be a very, because it seems to be a very, interesting characterization of what, interesting characterization of what, interesting characterization of what, graphs can reveal about interventions, graphs can reveal about interventions, graphs can reveal about interventions, and and how we compute them because, and and how we compute them because, and and how we compute them because, again remember adjustment sets right I, again remember adjustment sets right I, again remember adjustment sets right I, mean there's the parents in the, mean there's the parents in the, mean there's the parents in the, formulation and the parents I mean, formulation and the parents I mean,

choose your graph you render your causal, choose your graph you render your causal, inferences differently again we remember, inferences differently again we remember, inferences differently again we remember, from causal effect estimation and so on, from causal effect estimation and so on, from causal effect estimation and so on, that some people just see causality as, that some people just see

be very, actually even be drastic can be very, actually even be drastic can be very, valuable so yeah let's look at some, valuable so yeah let's look at some, valuable so yeah let's look at some, properties so um yeah I've just have, properties so um yeah I've just have, properties so um yeah I've just have, this little overview of some of these, this little overview of some of these, this little overview of some of these, properties that that you know Sid is, properties that that you know Sid is, properties that that you know Sid is, known to have so for example uh it's, known to have so for example uh it's, known to have so for example uh it's, actually bounded by the number of, actually bounded by the number of, actually bounded by the number of, variables so P so Sid is always going to, variables so P so Sid is always going to, variables so P so Sid is always going to, be between zero and uh P * P minus one, be between zero and uh P * P minus one, be between zero and uh P * P minus one, um for equal graphs I mean ideally you, um for equal graphs I mean ideally you, um for equal graphs I mean ideally you, have them right that if you know the, have them right that if you know the, have them right that if you know the, graphs are the same that Sid is the same, graphs are the same that Sid is the same, graphs are the same that Sid is the same, um for subgraphs I think this is one of, um for subgraphs I think this is one of, um for subgraphs I think this is one of, the more interesting ones if a graph is, the more interesting ones if a graph is, the more interesting ones if a graph is, a subgraph which was the case for the, a subgraph which was the case for the, a subgraph which was the case for the, first one right we just added an edge, first one right we just added an edge, first one right we just added an edge, then Sid is actually zero right and it's, then Sid is actually zero right and it's, then Sid is actually zero right and it's, not just it's really the equivalence, not just it's really the equivalence, not just it's really the equivalence, here and then finally what I've listed, here and then finally what I've listed, here and then finally what I've listed, here is that, here is that, here is that, well we talked about distances in metric, well we talked about distances in metric, well we talked about distances in metric, metrics earlier and how you know maybe, metrics earlier and how you know maybe, metrics earlier and how you know maybe, it's used sometimes Loosely or maybe, it's used sometimes Loosely or maybe, it's used sometimes Loosely or maybe, very precisely and then you know, very precisely and then you know, very precisely and then you know, distance is not the same as a metric but, distance is not the same as a metric but, distance is not the same as a metric but, Sid is actually not a metric it's a Prem, Sid is actually not a metric it's a Prem, Sid is actually not a metric it's a Prem, metric because of the fact that it's not, metric because of the fact that it's not, metric because of the fact that it's not, symmetric so not the positivity part but, symmetric so not the positivity part but, symmetric so not the positivity part but, the the symmetric part so if you put in, the the symmetric part so if you put in, the the symmetric part so if you put in, G and H you might get you know nonzero, G and H you might get you know nonzero, G and H you might get you know nonzero, while H and G gives you zero actually, while H and G gives you zero actually, while H and G gives you zero actually, any non-empty graph with the empty graph, any non-empty graph with the empty graph, any non-empty graph with the empty graph, combined would would yield this result, combined would would yield this result, combined would would yield this result, right so this is a very simple counter, right so this is a very simple counter, right so this is a very simple counter, example to show that it's not a metric, example to show that it's not a metric, example to show that it's not a metric, in in the classical mathematical, in in the classical mathematical, in in the classical mathematical, sense however there is ways of, sense however there is ways of, sense however there is ways of, extending um Sid to make it symmetric, extending um Sid to make it symmetric, extending um Sid to make it symmetric, right like simple harmonization, right like simple harmonization, right like simple harmonization, approaches and stuff like that so uh no, approaches and stuff like that so uh no, approaches and stuff like that so uh no, Rous about that yeah but I'm not showing, Rous about that yeah but I'm not showing, Rous about that yeah but I'm not showing, this here on the slides, this here on the slides, this here on the slides, now um now as we have done before with, now um now as we have done before with, now um now as we have done before with, Ed and CD how can we combine or how can, Ed and CD how can we combine or how can, Ed and CD how can we combine or how can, we maybe not combine let's just compare, we maybe not combine let's just compare, we maybe not combine let's just compare, shd and Sid so combine maybe in the, shd and Sid so combine maybe in the, shd and Sid so combine maybe in the, sense that when you do a paper you, sense that when you do a paper you, sense that when you do a paper you, should ideally plot both of them not, should ideally plot both of them not, should ideally plot both of them not, just one of them which favors your, just one of them which favors your, just one of them which favors your, results and um yeah so there's the zero, results and um yeah so there's the zero, results and um yeah so there's the zero, relation this is interesting right, relation this is interesting right, relation this is interesting right, because here so shd Zer actually implies, because here so shd Zer actually implies, because here so shd Zer actually implies, that Sid is zero um but not the the, that Sid is zero um but not the the, that Sid is zero um but not the the, other way around and you can actually, other way around and you can actually, other way around and you can actually, bound Sid you cannot easily bound shd, bound Sid you cannot easily bound shd, bound Sid you cannot easily bound shd, but you can bound Sid so um say shd is, but you can bound Sid so um say shd is, but you can bound Sid so um say shd is, equal to one as in our previous example, equal to one as in our previous example, equal to one as in our previous example, then you have this sharp Bound 2 * P, then you have this sharp Bound 2 * P, then you have this sharp Bound 2 * P, minus one um sure I, minus one um sure I, minus one um sure I, mean it's it's a good thing to know, mean it's

causal mechanism right so so looking at, causal mechanism right so so looking at, causal mechanism right so so looking at, you know verification of uh deep models, you know verification of uh deep models, you know verification of uh deep models, essentially things that we really care, essentially things that we really care, essentially things that we really care, about in practice use a lot, about in practice use a lot, about in practice use a lot, nowadays so just a quick reminder I, nowadays so just a quick reminder I, nowadays so just a quick reminder I, guess we have seen nuances of this at, guess we have seen nuances of this at, guess we have seen nuances of this at, least in the lecture that was held by, least in the lecture that was held by, least in the lecture that was held by, Floria on representation learning but, Floria on representation learning but, Floria on representation learning but, disentanglement is this kind of I don't, disentanglement is this kind of I

this caal, moment yeah which somehow has this caal, moment yeah which somehow has this caal, notion because it's about being semantic, notion because it's about being semantic, notion because it's about being semantic, it's about being controllable which, it's about being controllable which, it's about being controllable which, amounts to interventions but on the, amounts to interventions but on the, amounts to interventions but on the, other hand there was never really a, other hand there was never really a, other hand there was never really a, proper definition everyone had their own, proper definition everyone had their own, proper definition everyone had their own, thing or at least say consistent, thing or at least say consistent, thing or at least say consistent, definition and and then again it's it's, definition and and then again it's it's, definition and and then again it's it's, it's a lot more biased towards machine, it's a lot more biased towards machine, it's a lot more biased towards machine, learning about even even towards, learning about even even towards, learning about even even towards, specific models like variational Auto, specific models like variational Auto, specific models like variational Auto, encoders which structure the Laten space, encoders which structure the Laten space, encoders which structure the Laten space, and stuff like that um but yeah just, and stuff like that um but yeah just, and stuff like that um but yeah just, briefly what does this integr really do, briefly what does this integr really do, briefly what does this integr really do, so we try we in the regime of, so we try we in the regime of, so we try we in the regime of, representation learning right so these, representation learning right so these, representation learning right so these, nodes should represent now our latent, nodes should represent now our latent, nodes should represent now our latent, code our latent space the kind of thing, code our latent space the kind of thing, code our latent space the kind of thing, that we learn from data yeah remember in, that we learn from data yeah remember in, that we learn from data yeah remember in, causal representation learning we know, causal representation learning we know, causal representation learning we know, the causal variables but we we don't, the causal variables but we we don't, the causal variables but we we don't, know the uh and we uh we don't um we, know the uh and we uh we don't um we, know the uh and we uh we don't um we, don't know the causal variables and we, don't know the causal variables and we, don't know the causal variables and we, don't know the causal graph of course, don't know the causal graph of course, don't know the causal graph of course, and we try to kind of uh yeah learn both, and we try to kind of uh yeah learn both, and we try to kind of uh yeah learn both, things in the same time right and um, things in the same time right and

weights right again this might not be, weights right again this might not be, weights right again this might not be, practically feasible right but you know, practically feasible right but you know, practically feasible right but you know, for the synthetic stuff we can always do, for the synthetic stuff we can always do, for the synthetic stuff we can always do, this and conceptually I change all these, this and conceptually I change all these, this and conceptually I change all these, different things and that's really, different things and that's really, different things and that's really, capturing our causal notion, capturing our causal notion, capturing our causal notion, here so it's really assessing the degree, here so it's really assessing the degree, here so it's really assessing the degree, to which ZL is robustly isolate from any, to which ZL is robustly isolate from any, to which ZL is robustly isolate from any, of the extra, of the extra, of the extra, causes and now a very cool result here I, causes and now a very cool result here I, causes and now a very cool result here I, think also very important result which, think also very important result which, think also very important result which, really proves that you know this thing, really proves that you know this thing, really proves that you know this thing, is uh sensible you know there's, is uh sensible you know there's, is uh sensible you know there's, obviously different BCS also in the, obviously different BCS also in the, obviously different BCS also in the, disentanglement literature which are, disentanglement literature which are, disentanglement literature which are, non-causal whatsoever right for example, non-causal whatsoever right for example, non-causal whatsoever right for example, scores like Mi which are based on Mutual, scores like Mi which are based on Mutual, scores like Mi which are based on Mutual, information yeah and what we're plotting, information yeah and what we're plotting, information yeah and what we're plotting, here on the x-axis is now you know, here on the x-axis is now you know, here on the x-axis is now you know, Mutual information and then on the y-, Mutual information and then on the y-, Mutual information and then on the y-, axis against it the robustness code the, axis against it the robustness code the, axis against it the robustness code the, IRS that we just defined yeah and we're, IRS that we just defined yeah and we're, IRS that we just defined yeah and we're, kind of looking at the relation here, kind of looking at the relation here, kind of looking at the relation here, and all these samples which end up here, and all these samples which end up here, and all these samples which end up here, now right so these are you know for, now right so these are you know for, now right so these are you know for, whatever data set you're looking at, whatever data set you're looking at, whatever data set you're looking at, right uh these are just the samples and, right uh these are just the samples and, right uh these are just the samples and, then evaluated how robust are they in, then evaluated how robust are they in, then evaluated how robust are they in, the light of Mi and how robust are they, the light of Mi and how robust are they, the light of Mi and how robust are they, in the light of of IRS and these samples, in the light of of IRS and these samples, in the light of of IRS and these samples, here in the red box all the ones where, here in the red box all the ones where, here in the red box all the ones where, IRS actually disagreeing with Mi right, IRS actually disagreeing with Mi right, IRS actually disagreeing with Mi right, Mi is saying like oh high Mutual, Mi is saying like oh high Mutual, Mi is saying like oh high Mutual, information very robust but IRS is, information very robust but IRS is, information very robust but IRS is, saying like no it's yeah so it's, saying like no it's yeah so it's, saying like no it's yeah so it's, really a nice discussion between the two, really a nice discussion between the two, really a nice discussion between the two, here and to give this uh visual example, here and to give this uh visual example, here and to give this uh visual example, right uh let's do this I I think this is, right uh let's do this I I think this is, right uh let's do this I I think this is, always what I what I like most uh when, always what I what I like most uh when, always what I what I like most uh when, when looking at this particular work so, when looking at this particular work so, when looking at this particular work so, there's also for example the D Sprites, there's also for example the D Sprites, there's also for example the D Sprites, data set it's very similar to this, data set it's very similar to this, data set it's very similar to this, entanglement lip but really just in 2D, entanglement lip but really just in 2D, entanglement lip but really just in 2D, less complex in that sense yeah uh you, less complex in that sense yeah uh you, less complex in that sense yeah uh you, have you know color shape scale, have you know color shape scale, have you know color shape scale, orientation X position y position this, orientation X position y position this, orientation X position y position this, animation is really showing you all the, animation is really showing you all the, animation is really showing you all the, different images you could have at least, different images you could have at least, different images you could have at

actually changing okay no not for, everything and um what you're seeing, everything and um what you're seeing, everything and um what you're seeing, here now are violent plots of density, here now are violent plots of density, here now are violent plots of density, estimations uh of the conditional, estimations uh of the conditional, estimations uh of the conditional, distributions for your learned, distributions for your learned, distributions for your learned, representations at L given a generative, representations at L given a generative, representations at L given a generative, Factor J GJ so let's look at the left, Factor J GJ so let's look at the left, Factor J GJ so let's look at the left, one here so shape there's three, one here so shape there's three, one here so shape there's three, different shapes so I don't know heart, different shapes so I don't know heart, different shapes so I don't know heart, uh ellipsoid and maybe a square yeah and, uh ellipsoid and maybe a square yeah and, uh ellipsoid and maybe a square yeah and, then you choose any of those shapes and, then you choose any of those shapes and, then you choose any of those shapes and, this is now the distribution right this, this is now the distribution right this, this is now the distribution right this, is the the the distribution of the, is the the the distribution of the, is the the the distribution of the, values of Z6 now right um for any of, values of Z6 now right um for any of, values of Z6 now right um for any of, those shapes and we can see for example, those shapes and we can see for example, those shapes and we can see for example, that z uh Z6 is very stable around, that z uh Z6 is very stable around, that z uh Z6 is very stable around, almost like 0o, almost like 0o, almost like 0o, 0.1 uh for for all of these different um, 0.1 uh for for all of these different um, 0.1 uh for for all of these different um, shapes uh and then now for example if, shapes uh and then now for example if, shapes uh and then now for example if, you look at scale we see you know scale, you look at scale we see you know scale, you look at scale we see you know scale, actually affects

uh apart from having a very nice, well uh apart from having a very nice, and thorough analysis is this result, and thorough analysis is this result, and thorough analysis is this result, here same model just trained differently, here same model just trained differently, here same model just trained differently, how is it trained well also with IRS, how is it trained well also with IRS, how is it trained well also with IRS, right with their scope so it's also uh, right with their scope so it's also uh, right with their scope so it's also uh, taking care of all the samples where you, taking care of all the samples where you, taking care of all the samples where you, know IRS is saying it's right and, know IRS is saying it's right and, know IRS is saying it's right and, it seems that IRS was doing the right, it seems that IRS was doing the right, it seems that IRS was doing the right, job with these samples because what do, job with these samples because what do, job with these
