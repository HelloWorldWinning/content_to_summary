好的，这是根据您的要求，对所提供文本进行的核心思想提炼、总结与可视化。

### **撰写研究论文的核心策略与流程**

#### **1. 核心理念：创作与编辑分离**
*   **创作阶段（撰写初稿）**:
    *   **目标**: 快速生成一份**完整**的初稿，而非**完美**的初稿。
    *   **心态**: 这是创造性工作。要抑制住随时修改、纠正错误的冲动，避免因追求完美而中断思路，浪费时间。
*   **编辑阶段（修改完善）**:
    *   **目标**: 将初稿打磨成清晰、简洁、连贯且科学准确的终稿。
    *   **心态**: 这是批判性、分析性的工作。在拥有完整初稿后，再进行系统性的修改。

#### **2. 写作前的准备工作 (Preliminaries)**
*   **内容准备**: 回顾自己阅读相关论文时做的笔记，并重新进行一次全面的文献检索，确保背景知识最新、最全。
*   **受众分析**:
    *   明确论文类型（研究、综述、教学等）。
    *   确定目标期刊及其读者群（本科生、研究人员等）。
    *   **最关键的受众是审稿人（Reviewers）**，必须在初稿中尽可能预见并解决他们可能提出的问题。

#### **3. 高效写作算法 (The Algorithm)**
这是一个非线性的、从易到难的写作流程，旨在克服拖延、保持动力。

1.  **制定大纲 (Create an Outline)**:
    *   将论文研究所得的**图 (Figures) 和表 (Tables)** 按照逻辑顺序排列。
    *   这个有序的图表清单本身就是最有效、最直观的论文大纲。

2.  **写作顺序 (Writing Order)**:
    *   **第一步：实验部分 (Experimental)**
        *   这是最熟悉、最容易写的部分，从这里开始可以轻松地启动写作进程。
    *   **第二步：结果与讨论 (Results and Discussion)**
        *   遵循图表大纲，逐一描述并讨论每个图表所展示的结果。这是论文的核心内容。
    *   **第三步：结论 (Conclusions)**
        *   清晰地总结研究的主要发现。推荐使用编号列表（如 1, 2, 3...）的形式，使贡献一目了然。
    *   **第四步：引言 (Introduction)**
        *   在完成核心内容后，再来写最难的引言。引言必须回答两个核心问题：
            *   **为什么要做这项研究？（研究动机与目的）**
            *   **读者需要哪些背景知识来理解本研究？（提供必要的背景信息）**
    *   **第五步：参考文献 (References)**
        *   在撰写初稿时，可以在相应位置做引用标记，但不要停下来整理格式。
        *   在全文基本完成后，集中处理参考文献，确保格式正确、信息无误，以免激怒审稿人和读者。

#### **4. 最终建议 (Final Advice)**
*   **遵守规则**: 务必严格遵守目标期刊的稿件要求，否则论文可能会被直接退回。
*   **精益求精**: 写作是科学研究中最严谨、最考验逻辑的环节，它能将科学家的思考变得精确。
*   **借鉴学习**: 阅读优秀的书籍和文章（如 Royce Murray 的《如何写一篇糟糕的科研论文》）来学习写作技巧。

Content:
Hi, I'm Professor Carr, University of Minnesota Department of Chemistry. I'd like to talk to you this afternoon about how to go about writing a research paper. Over the years, I and my group have produced about 400 papers, and in working with new graduate students, I've learned that there's a lot of fear and trepidation, and at the same time excitement about writing a research paper, especially the first one. And I want to see if I can make it an enjoyable and productive experience for you. I believe that it doesn't take that much time to produce a first draft, and that's what I'm going to focus on this afternoon, is how to produce a first draft, which is really important. I think one of the biggest problems in writing a research paper, certainly the first one, is suppressing the urge to procrastinate and put off beginning the work. And that's part of my strategy in the way I approach writing research papers. So before you get ready to write the paper, there are some important preliminaries. Number one, you should review your own notes that you've taken on papers that you've read that are relevant to the work that you're writing up, and you should renew your literature search. This is very important to have this done before you start writing your paper. The second preliminary issue is very important, and it goes back to high school, and that is you need to determine who your audience is. I'm sure you were taught this way back when. And this is important in writing up a research paper. You need to know what the purpose of the paper is. Is it a research paper? Is it a review paper? Is it a tutorial paper? What journal is it intended for? Are the primary readers of the paper going to be undergraduates or researchers? But as always with any paper, the real primary reader is the reviewer. These are the gatekeepers, and it is very important that you address their concerns, and the more you can get them addressed in the first draft, the better off you are in finally getting the paper published. So preliminaries don't count for the weekend that you're going to write your paper. You've got to have your preliminaries done. Now before getting into the details, I want you to understand what I consider to be the big picture. First of all, producing your initial draft is the creative part of the job, and what I want you to do, what I think you need to do, is resist the temptation to correct mistakes as you produce this first draft. Your job now is to produce a complete first draft, not a perfect first draft. Editing is the second stage of the work. It is the critical thinking, analytical part of the job, and editing at this point before you've completed your first draft is a waste of time. Fixing a sentence and making it perfect, if it never appears in the paper, because it turns out to be irrelevant, is a waste of time. Okay, so over the years I've developed an algorithm, and I've talked to a number of my colleagues, and many of them use the same algorithm. And it runs roughly as follows. Number one, just get started. Don't procrastinate. Get something down on paper. Number two, you need to work from an outline. The reason an outline is important is you may not finish the paper in one sitting. You probably won't finish the paper in one sitting. And if you've got an outline, you can pick the work up back where you finished before, you're not going to have to read it over. You're going to know where to begin. The third part of this is that the outline is easy to do, so it's actually fun to write an outline. Before you have a paper to write in your head, you've got your data. You've got your tables of data. You've got your figures. Take those and put them in order. Arrange them in some logical sequence, much like you might arrange them for a talk. And that list of figures and tables in order is really the outline for the paper. Now the next point is the following. Do not write the introduction to the paper at this time. The introduction is the hardest part of a paper to write. So don't start there because the urge to procrastinate is going to kick in again. The easiest part of a paper to write is the experimental. It's the part of the paper that you're most familiar with. You've done the experiments. You know how they were done. So write the experimental and you will be moving forward. It's an easy part to write. The next part of the paper that I would focus on would be the results in discussion, following the outline that you created from your list of figures and your list of tables. And this is a little bit more difficult to write than the experimental, but you're really getting started now. So basically you've got a draft consisting of the experimental results in discussion. Once that's done, the really hard part of writing kicks in and that's doing the hard critical editing, but you've got a first draft and that's the important thing. Now the critical part is when you convert that into clear, concise and coherent English and make sure that the science that you've written is correct. The final part of the algorithm is the cleanup. Write the conclusions. Personally, I like conclusions or summaries that is a numbered format. Conclusion one, conclusion two, conclusion three, where these are quite clearly separated from one another and it's easy to see the contributions of the work. Now we have to do the introduction. And there are two very important things that need to be covered in the introduction. Number one, why was the study done? What is its purpose? Number two, you've got to collect the relevant essential background information and put that together in the introduction. You need to be able to give the readers a sufficient background to understand what you did. So the very last step in following this algorithm is producing the references for the paper. Actually, I think it's a good idea for you to write some notes as you go through the first draft and manuscripts indicating what references might be needed, what they would be about, but not to stop and collect the references at that time because it's just going to interrupt the entire flow of the work. But when the manuscript is just about finished, you need to get the exact references so that the reviewers and the readers can really find the information without trouble. It's extremely annoying to reviewers and readers when these are not done properly. So basically you've got the job done now and I want to leave you with a few final words. There's an old saying attributed to Sir Francis Bacon, reading Make at the Full Men, Conference of Ready Man and Writing in Exact Man. And each of those things that we do in doing science, we talk to our fellow scientists, we go to conferences, a lot of reading, but in producing a paper for publication, that's when we want to focus on our critical skills, when we want to make sure that our scientific arguments are correct and logical. So writing is the most exacting part of what we do as a scientist. Some final points always review the manuscript requirements for the Journal of Interest. There's no point in the paper that doesn't follow the manuscript requirements. It will probably be returned, unreviewed, with a semi-nasty note from the editor. And really finally, I want to leave you with a few references on writing. There are some classic books here. There are some books very relevant to writing a paper on chemistry. And I want to point out a wonderful short paper by Professor Royce Murray, the former editor of the Journal Analytical Chemistry, skillful writing of an awful research paper, seven rules to follow. This little paper is a gem. It will, in mock style, tells you the worst things you can do in writing a manuscript. I hope that you'll find this helpful. And it was a pleasure being here. Some reviewers get really bent out of shape, especially if it's one of their papers. .
