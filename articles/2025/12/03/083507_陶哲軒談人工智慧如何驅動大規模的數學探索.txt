好的，以下是根据您提供的文本内容提炼的核心思想摘要。

### 核心思想摘要

#### 一、 提纲式总结

**I. 机器辅助数学的演变历程**
*   **A. 历史渊源：** 数学辅助工具的历史长达数千年，从算盘到作为一种职业的“人类计算机”（尤其是在战争期间），其核心是执行大规模计算。
*   **B. 传统计算机应用：**
    1.  **构建数据库与制表：** 通过计算和整理庞大数据表（如素数表、对数表）来发现规律，并催生重要猜想（如素数定理）。现代的例子是在线整数序列百科全书（OEIS）。
    2.  **科学计算与数值模拟：** 执行大规模、高强度的数值运算，解决从流体力学到代数几何的复杂问题。
    3.  **暴力穷举与逻辑求解：** 利用SAT/SMT求解器，通过海量案例分析来证明特定问题，例如“毕达哥拉斯三元组问题”产生了一个长达200TB的计算机证明。

**II. 现代机器辅助数学的三大前沿**
*   **A. 形式化证明助手 (Formal Proof Assistants)**
    1.  **核心目标：** 将人类的数学证明翻译成计算机可严格验证的代码，以确保其绝对正确性，消除人为错误和逻辑漏洞。
    2.  **关键案例：**
        *   **开普勒猜想：** Thomas Hales耗时12年将其复杂的证明完全形式化。
        *   **凝聚数学：** Peter Scholze的基础性定理在一个18个月的大型协作项目中被形式化，增强了整个理论的可信度。
    3.  **深远影响：** 这种方式催生了全新的大规模、分布式协作模式，通过“蓝图”分解任务，使得不同背景的专家可以共同完成一个庞大证明的验证。

*   **B. 机器学习 (Machine Learning)**
    1.  **核心作用：** 充当“灵感发现器”，通过分析海量数据，找出不同数学领域之间人类难以察觉的隐藏关联和模式。
    2.  **关键案例：** 在纽结理论中，机器学习模型成功预测了两种来源（代数拓扑和双曲几何）完全不同的不变量之间的关系，最终引导数学家提出了新的、可被证明的猜想。
    3.  **工作模式：** 它不直接提供证明，而是通过揭示相关性，为人类数学家指明最有希望的研究方向。

*   **C. 大语言模型 (Large Language Models - LLM)**
    1.  **现状与局限：** 能力极不均衡，有时能解决奥赛级别问题，但更多时候会在基础算术上犯错。它们基于概率生成文本，而非逻辑推理。
    2.  **当前价值：**
        *   **创意缪斯：** 作为头脑风暴的伙伴，提出人类可能忽略的解题思路（如建议使用生成函数）。
        *   **编程助手：** 在形式化证明等任务中，通过代码补全（如GitHub Copilot）极大提高工作效率。
    3.  **未来方向：** 将其与可靠的计算工具（如Python）或形式化证明语言（如Lean）结合，强制其生成正确、可验证的输出，以克服其“幻觉”问题。

**III. 未来展望**
*   **A. 近期定位：** 在可预见的未来，AI不会取代数学家，而是作为功能日益强大的“研究助手”存在。
*   **B. 革命性潜力：**
    1.  **自动生成猜想：** 通过分析庞大的数学数据集，自动提出有深度、有价值的新猜想。
    2.  **实现“规模化”数学：** 从证明单个定理，转向利用AI同时测试一种方法在一千个类似问题上的有效性，从而系统性地探索数学理论的适用边界和威力，这是一种前所未有的研究范式。

#### 二、 核心观点

虽然人工智能短期内无法取代数学家，但它正作为一种日益强大的辅助工具，通过形式化验证、模式发现和大规模协作，深刻地改变着数学研究的方法论与未来图景。

#### 三、 内容框架

本次演讲的框架遵循一条清晰的演进路径：从回顾计算机在数学中扮演的传统角色（如计算和数据制表）出发，深入剖析了当前三大革命性前沿技术（形式化证明、机器学习、大语言模型）如何重塑研究方法，最后对人机协作的未来进行了展望，强调了AI作为辅助工具而非替代者的核心定位。

is, um the vorono polytope of a sphere is, um the vorono polytope of a sphere is, just all the points which are closer to, just all the points which are closer to, just all the points which are closer to, the center of that sphere than to all, the center of that sphere than to all, the center of that sphere than to all, the other spheres okay so you can sort, the other spheres okay so you can sort, the other spheres okay so you can sort, of split up space into all these these, of split up space into all these these, of split up space into all these these, polytopes and these these polytopes have, polytopes and these these polytopes have, polytopes and these these polytopes have, certain volumes um they you can also, certain volumes um they you can also, certain volumes um they you can also, count their faces and the surface areas, count their faces and the surface areas, count their faces and the surface areas, and so forth and so they they all have, and so forth and so they they

I won't talk, areas of mathematics but I won't talk, areas of mathematics but I won't talk, about um and then there's these things, about um and then there's these things, about um and then there's these things, called hyperbolic inv variants which, called hyperbolic inv variants which, called hyperbolic inv variants which, come from geometry um you can take the, come from geometry um you can take the, come from geometry um you can take the, complement of the knot and that is, complement of the knot and that is, complement of the knot and that is, actually what's called it's usually um a, actually what's called it's usually um a, actually what's called it's usually um a, hyperbolic space it comes with a certain, hyperbolic space it comes with a certain, hyperbolic space it comes with a

these are invariant that are real or, um these are invariant that are real or, complex, complex, complex, numbers and so uh every knot comes with, numbers and so uh every knot comes with, numbers and so uh every knot comes with, some combinator invariance like, some combinator invariance like, some combinator invariance like, signatures um and it comes with these, signatures um and it comes with

the, called the hyperic volume and the, called the hyperic volume and the, homological cusp shape and so forth and, homological cusp shape and so forth and, homological cusp shape and so forth and, these are real and complex, these are real and complex, these are real and complex, numbers but no one knew of any link, numbers but no one knew of any link, numbers but no one knew of any link, between these two so there are these two, between these two so there are these two, between these two so there are these two, separate ways to create statistics of, separate ways to create statistics of, separate ways to create statistics of, knots and they didn't there was no there, knots and they didn't there was no there, knots and they didn't there was no there, was no connection between them uh so it, was no connection between them uh so it, was no connection between them uh so it, was only very recently that people, was only very recently that people, was only very recently that people, started using machine learning to um to, started using machine learning to um to, started using machine learning to um to, attack this problem so they created, attack this problem so they created, attack this problem so they created, databases of millions of knots which, databases of millions of knots which, databases of millions of knots which, actually was already slightly non your, actually was already slightly non your, actually was already slightly non your, task uh and they trained a new network, task uh and they trained a new network, task uh and they trained a new network, on this uh and they found that after, on this uh and they found that after, on this uh and they found that after, training the new network you you could, training the new network you you could, training the new network you you could, give it all the the hyperbolic geometry, give it all the the hyperbolic geometry, give it all the the hyperbolic geometry, invariance and like 90% of the time it, invariance and like 90% of the time it, invariance and like 90% of the time it, will predict it will guess the right, will predict it will guess the right, will predict it will guess the right, signature um so it created this black, signature um so it created this black, signature um so it created this black, box and it will tell you how the sign, box and it will tell you how the sign, box and it will tell you how the sign, the signature was somehow hidden, the signature was somehow hidden, the signature was somehow hidden, somewhere in these geometric invariants, somewhere in these geometric
