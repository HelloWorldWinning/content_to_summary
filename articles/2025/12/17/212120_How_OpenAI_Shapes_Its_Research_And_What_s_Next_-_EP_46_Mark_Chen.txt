好的，这是根据您提供的文本内容和要求整理的核心思想摘要。

### **核心思想摘要**

#### **I. OpenAI 的人才战略与企业文化**
*   **人才争夺与留存**：面对 Meta 等公司的激烈人才争夺（如“送汤”趣闻所展现的），OpenAI 并不采用“美元对美元”的薪酬匹配策略。其核心吸引力在于强大的使命感——即开发 AGI 的愿景和巨大的潜在价值，这使得员工愿意为共同的目标而奋斗。
*   **独特的组织文化**：OpenAI 致力于模糊“研究员”与“工程师”的界限。它强调构建大型模型本质上是一种深度的工程实践，优秀的“研究员”同样是杰出的工程师，这种文化避免了内部层级和隔阂，确保了从思想到实践的高效转化。

#### **II. OpenAI 的核心研究理念与管理**
*   **专注长期主义**：公司的核心是成为一家纯粹的 AI 研究公司。它避免陷入追赶竞争对手（如 Gemini 发布）的短期动态中，而是专注于进行能塑造未来技术方向的长期押注，例如早期对“语言模型上的强化学习（RLHF）”的投入。
*   **以研究为中心的资源调配**：公司通过明确的优先级排序和算力分配来管理众多研究项目。其重点始终是推动前沿的探索性研究，而非仅仅追赶或复现其他实验室的成果。

#### **III. 从竞技编程看 AI 的能力演进与未来**
*   **AI 能力的指数级飞跃**：以竞技编程为例，AI 模型在极短的时间内（一到两个月）从业余水平跃升至世界顶尖水平，其解决问题的方式与人类的模式识别和直觉不同，展现出惊人的、有时是反直觉的能力。
*   **对未来评估体系的颠覆**：AI 的崛起使得传统的评估方式（如编程作业、面试）逐渐失效。未来的人才评估可能需要创新，例如设计一种特殊的、无法被“越狱”的 AI 作为面试官，通过深度对话来评估候选人的真实能力。

On the recruitment wars, I mean, there's&nbsp;&nbsp;, Meta was quite aggressive. What exactly does this&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, everyone kind of knows who they are, and I think&nbsp;&nbsp;, ingredients, not the only important ingredient,&nbsp;&nbsp;, building a great AI lab is to get the best talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;, aggressively employing the strategy. We haven't&nbsp;&nbsp;, story from Open AI's point of view. I think that&nbsp;&nbsp;, this unidirectional flow of talent over to Meta,&nbsp;&nbsp;, gone after a lot of people quite unsuccessfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;, staff, within my direct reports, before they hired&nbsp;&nbsp;, of my direct reports and they all declined. And of&nbsp;&nbsp;, of capital per year to deploy towards talent,&nbsp;&nbsp;, like we've been fairly good about protecting our&nbsp;&nbsp;, to see it escalate [00:01:30] over time., &nbsp;, actually went and hand delivered soup&nbsp;&nbsp;, from us just to show how far he would,&nbsp;&nbsp;, and it was shocking to me at the time,&nbsp;&nbsp;, things can be effective in their own way. And&nbsp;&nbsp;, [00:02:00] recruiting from Meta. You're doing a, &nbsp;, Soup, soup counting., &nbsp;, I've thought&nbsp;&nbsp;, for my staff, I'm going to take them to a&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, there's something I've learned about recruiting.&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, and probably better than any soup I could cook.&nbsp;&nbsp;, I've learned about just how to go aggressively&nbsp;&nbsp;, been actually very inspired by is that at OpenAI,&nbsp;&nbsp;, heard anyone say a GI is going to be developed at&nbsp;&nbsp;, research program at OpenAI. And [00:03:00] one&nbsp;&nbsp;, whole research org is we don't counter dollar for&nbsp;&nbsp;, meta is offering that people are very happy to&nbsp;&nbsp;, people really believe in the upside and believe&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, be one of the math, the, &nbsp;, I'm, &nbsp;, Sure you guys hung, &nbsp;, Out. Well, yeah, I mean I have hung&nbsp;&nbsp;, we don't do much anymore. Yeah, I mean, yeah, &nbsp;, Why did soup become the thing? It just, &nbsp;, I don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp;, been anything you can think of under the sun,&nbsp;&nbsp;, adventure. I play into the meme., &nbsp;, Is there any poker strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, back to what I've said about the&nbsp;&nbsp;, to retain every single person in the org,&nbsp;&nbsp;, developing talent and to understand who the key&nbsp;&nbsp;, I think we've done a phenomenal job at that., &nbsp;, [00:04:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;, Chen is here from OpenAI. He's the chief research&nbsp;&nbsp;, the last couple of years. Thank you so much for, &nbsp;, Getting that. Yeah, no,&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, world working on this very important project and&nbsp;&nbsp;, cool to have a chance [00:05:00] to chat. Yeah, &nbsp;, Thanks for having me on., &nbsp;, It is my pleasure. And I mean there's&nbsp;&nbsp;, because I've gotten to know you, like we said over&nbsp;&nbsp;, a bit more about your biography, but I also know&nbsp;&nbsp;, to go deep on a couple of things there. So we&nbsp;&nbsp;, by giving people a feel for your job, which in my&nbsp;&nbsp;, any of this wrong, but Sam has been, he's really&nbsp;&nbsp;, the food chain, but then you and Jakob are working&nbsp;&nbsp;, And then you're in this additional part of this&nbsp;&nbsp;, [00:06:00] onto these projects. So you kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;, mechanics of how you're going to get there. And&nbsp;&nbsp;, picture people doing everything in their power to&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, backroom deals to get the GPUs they need. But&nbsp;&nbsp;, out the priorities for the research org and also&nbsp;&nbsp;, really to that first point, there's this exercise&nbsp;&nbsp;, we take stock of all the projects at OpenAI and&nbsp;&nbsp;, and we go and try to deeply understand each one&nbsp;&nbsp;, I think for a company of 500 people, it's&nbsp;&nbsp;, priorities are and for those to be communicated&nbsp;&nbsp;, also through the way that we allocate compute., &nbsp;, Alright, what do we do at Core Memory?&nbsp;&nbsp;, companies, which is why Core Memory is sponsored&nbsp;&nbsp;, platform for many of these companies. 30,000&nbsp;&nbsp;, corporations rely on Brex is technology for&nbsp;&nbsp;, high [00:07:30] yield business banking and expense&nbsp;&nbsp;, my expenses. And Brex is ais software run right&nbsp;&nbsp;, spending money and take care of so much stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;, yourself. Go to brex.com/core memory to learn more&nbsp;&nbsp;, Let's get out of this archaic finance software&nbsp;&nbsp;, and Brex. So you've got, when you're talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;, the research team in an organization now that's&nbsp;&nbsp;, that, when you're talking about this 300 projects&nbsp;&nbsp;, giant frontier models and then some are probably&nbsp;&nbsp;, do you possibly keep track of all [00:08:30] that&nbsp;&nbsp;, about what merits GPUs and what doesn't?, &nbsp;, Absolutely. So I think it is very important when&nbsp;&nbsp;, focus. And one thing that differentiates, I think&nbsp;&nbsp;, always had core exploratory research. At its core.&nbsp;&nbsp;, results of other labs, of catching up to other&nbsp;&nbsp;, really our bread and butter. We're always trying&nbsp;&nbsp;, willing to invest the resources to make sure that&nbsp;&nbsp;, might be surprised at this, but more compute&nbsp;&nbsp;, than it is to training the actual artifact., &nbsp;, It's still got to be&nbsp;&nbsp;, by someone because everybody's going to put,&nbsp;&nbsp;, [00:09:30] when I was at the New York Times, you&nbsp;&nbsp;, wants to be on page one. Everybody thinks their&nbsp;&nbsp;, doing their very best job to tell you why this&nbsp;&nbsp;, worked weeks, months on whatever they're pitching.&nbsp;&nbsp;, Yeah, I mean it seems so difficult for me., &nbsp;, Yeah, no, it is also a difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;, you have to make are this is a project that we&nbsp;&nbsp;, good leadership. You need to clearly communicate&nbsp;&nbsp;, we're going to talk about. These are the types of&nbsp;&nbsp;, And there can be other things, but those have to&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, to your competitors. When I was looking through&nbsp;&nbsp;, [00:10:30] quick enough, but I mean this was a&nbsp;&nbsp;, of the other companies are, well, you guys were&nbsp;&nbsp;, the bar for others, so they were reactive right to&nbsp;&nbsp;, this interview a few days after Gemini three came&nbsp;&nbsp;, at times. [00:11:00] I mean, there's this back&nbsp;&nbsp;, sort of controversial, how valuable they are,&nbsp;&nbsp;, you also as time has gone on maintain that luxury&nbsp;&nbsp;, we're just going to do what we're going to do?, &nbsp;, Yeah, I think AI research today,&nbsp;&nbsp;, ever been. And the important thing is to not&nbsp;&nbsp;, dynamic because you can always say, Hey,&nbsp;&nbsp;, me in front of my competitor for a couple weeks&nbsp;&nbsp;, long-term sustainable way to do research because&nbsp;&nbsp;, to matter so much more, you're going to shape the&nbsp;&nbsp;, the side research directions around that sphere of&nbsp;&nbsp;, as an example [00:12:00] of this, right? We bet&nbsp;&nbsp;, to crack RO on language models. And this was a&nbsp;&nbsp;, obvious, but back then the environment was, Hey,&nbsp;&nbsp;, great, there's this post-training machine that's&nbsp;&nbsp;, I think today everyone would tell you thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;, can't have, can't live without. And so we're&nbsp;&nbsp;, bets and to figure out how we can scale and&nbsp;&nbsp;, of magnitude more compute than we have today., &nbsp;, And I get that intellectually in my,&nbsp;&nbsp;, a pure research company. When you look at OpenAI&nbsp;&nbsp;, parts of OpenAI that look much more familiar&nbsp;&nbsp;, have product lines, you've got all these&nbsp;&nbsp;, typically. I feel like you guys are still young&nbsp;&nbsp;, pressures yet, but as those companies go on,&nbsp;&nbsp;, on the things that are serving the bottom&nbsp;&nbsp;, always seems to get dwindled down over time., &nbsp;, And I think that's really&nbsp;&nbsp;, at its core. We're pure AI research company,&nbsp;&nbsp;, [00:13:30] many other companies out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;, during that era. And I think the spirit is build&nbsp;&nbsp;, in a safe way, of course. But yeah, I actually do&nbsp;&nbsp;, value. If you focus and you win at the research,&nbsp;&nbsp;, trap of getting too lost into like, oh, [00:14:00]&nbsp;&nbsp;, if you do the best research, that part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, so you feel like that soul, that, &nbsp;, That core culture and that core nucleus,&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, shouldn't call any of you guys researchers. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, feel like once you have this hierarchy [00:14:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;, a thing beyond engineering, you've completely&nbsp;&nbsp;, building a big model, so much is in the practice&nbsp;&nbsp;, how you make your kernels that much faster. How&nbsp;&nbsp;, a deep engineering practice. And if you don't have&nbsp;&nbsp;, scale to the number of GPUs we use today, &nbsp;, Because I think there, well, okay, but there&nbsp;&nbsp;, an engineer. You know what I mean? So do you feel&nbsp;&nbsp;, Is that kind of what you're saying, or? Well, &nbsp;, I just feel like researchers,&nbsp;&nbsp;, Some of our best researchers, they're&nbsp;&nbsp;, billion ideas and many of them are not good,&nbsp;&nbsp;, person really worth it? They come up with some&nbsp;&nbsp;, executing on the clear path ahead. And so there's&nbsp;&nbsp;, and I think it's hard to just lump it into one&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, you with too many competitive [00:16:00] rival&nbsp;&nbsp;, out, I did wonder what happens with you personally&nbsp;&nbsp;, everybody go and look and see what it can do? Is&nbsp;&nbsp;, at these new models to see what they can do?, &nbsp;, Yeah, so to speak to Gemini&nbsp;&nbsp;, model. And I think one thing we do is try to&nbsp;&nbsp;, much, and just looking purely at the benchmarks,&nbsp;&nbsp;, internally that perform at the level of Gemini&nbsp;&nbsp;, release them soon and we can release successor&nbsp;&nbsp;, kind of the benchmarks only tell you so much,&nbsp;&nbsp;, in their own way. There is this math problem,&nbsp;&nbsp;, of them has quite cracked it, even the thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, here, maybe it gets trained on, but yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;, year. It's this, the 42 problem. So you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;, 42, and you have access to a bunch of primitives,&nbsp;&nbsp;, primes less than 42, and you want to make as&nbsp;&nbsp;, as possible. So it's a very cute puzzle, but&nbsp;&nbsp;, the optimal solution. But I haven't seen one&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, direction I want to ask you about, &nbsp;, Absolutely., &nbsp;, Just before we get there. So I know I've seen you,&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, just curious if this is at all right. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;, is coming out on a Thursday, I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;, at it? Or is it not quite that drastic?, &nbsp;, No, I mean, I think it's in long arcs&nbsp;&nbsp;, obsessions. [00:18:30] I think any endeavor you&nbsp;&nbsp;, been focusing on pre-training, specifically&nbsp;&nbsp;, last half year. And I think it's a result of some&nbsp;&nbsp;, building that muscle of pre-training at OpenAI,&nbsp;&nbsp;, making sure that all of the important areas&nbsp;&nbsp;, [00:19:00] That's what creates the artifacts&nbsp;&nbsp;, with Gemini through easily on pre-training., &nbsp;, Okay. I want to ask about the pre-training,&nbsp;&nbsp;, this a lot. Okay. But you're saying that you're&nbsp;&nbsp;, new models just when they appear and more at&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, puzzle [00:19:30] that you were at. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;, he was doing a coding competition. And I got super&nbsp;&nbsp;, guy, Kennedy, I don't know if he's still famous,&nbsp;&nbsp;, coding competitions. And so I went to watch&nbsp;&nbsp;, they still do, but they had an annual, &nbsp;, Hacker cup., &nbsp;, Yeah. Hacker cup. And that's&nbsp;&nbsp;, know you, I think did [00:20:00] math competitions&nbsp;&nbsp;, high school. And then did you also do i I, &nbsp;, Stuff. So I got into coding&nbsp;&nbsp;, that convinced me to take my first coding class,&nbsp;&nbsp;, at that time. Whereas math is the purest&nbsp;&nbsp;, prove your worth. I mean, I think I was probably&nbsp;&nbsp;, mean, it became this super [00:20:30] rewarding&nbsp;&nbsp;, keep in touch with my friends from college., &nbsp;, You went to MIT?, &nbsp;, Yeah, I went to MITI graduated, and every&nbsp;&nbsp;, just to keep in with each other. And over time,&nbsp;&nbsp;, started competing fairly well and then writing&nbsp;&nbsp;, eventually started coaching that [00:21:00] team.&nbsp;&nbsp;, I've met people like Scott that you know., &nbsp;, Yeah. Okay. So I think lots of people might be&nbsp;&nbsp;, kids going through that. The i I and these coding&nbsp;&nbsp;, it's so much better, but when I saw them, I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;, that's a puzzle, and you are trying to find the&nbsp;&nbsp;, that. And you're in this race against everybody&nbsp;&nbsp;, And then some people try to get there really fast,&nbsp;&nbsp;, problem and there's this trade off, right?, &nbsp;, Yeah, absolutely., &nbsp;, Right. And so you actually&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, the coach of the US National?, &nbsp;, Yeah, one of the coaches., &nbsp;, One of the coaches,&nbsp;&nbsp;, [00:22:00] the us? We hadn't won one in a&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, never predict what the makeup of top&nbsp;&nbsp;, very spiky team, I think two years ago., &nbsp;, And, &nbsp;, Yeah, I believe they won the olympiad, &nbsp;, Because I feel like usually it's like China&nbsp;&nbsp;, Yeah. So the big competition [00:22:30] takes&nbsp;&nbsp;, does it look like? How many people show up?, &nbsp;, So they take the&nbsp;&nbsp;, is as much of a competition as it is a social&nbsp;&nbsp;, all go on to do phenomenal things. And yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;, you get just three problems, five hours to solve&nbsp;&nbsp;, [00:23:00] all the pressure in the room. But it's&nbsp;&nbsp;, they make lifetime friends through it. And as, &nbsp;, A coach, I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;, you spend on this? What does that look like?, &nbsp;, Honestly, the kids are, so sometimes it's&nbsp;&nbsp;, strategy. I think you're going to have good days,&nbsp;&nbsp;, have good hours within the contest, bad hours,&nbsp;&nbsp;, head. There's a lot of similarities between&nbsp;&nbsp;, It's on a much longer timescale, but researchers&nbsp;&nbsp;, let those strings of failures get into your head&nbsp;&nbsp;, think a lot of it's morale management at a certain&nbsp;&nbsp;, that contests [00:24:00] have helped me realize&nbsp;&nbsp;, towards solving these contest problems, which&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 3:, &nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, different way from humans. We typically think&nbsp;&nbsp;, recognition. You can take any problem if it maps&nbsp;&nbsp;, to be able to solve it. But what I've noticed is&nbsp;&nbsp;, message is very ad hoc. [00:24:30] I didn't think&nbsp;&nbsp;, of the easier problems for the ai. So yeah, I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;, in Frontier research, it's going to do something&nbsp;&nbsp;, intuition for what's easy and what's not., &nbsp;, Okay. Is it vaguely, when D minded,&nbsp;&nbsp;, where it was doing things human, it was playing&nbsp;&nbsp;, of vaguely similar [00:25:00] to that or, &nbsp;, I think so. I think&nbsp;&nbsp;, an inflection point in frontier research,&nbsp;&nbsp;, this is I think three days after the launch,&nbsp;&nbsp;, he had been playing around with the models,&nbsp;&nbsp;, [00:25:30] And I challenged him with the ProModel,&nbsp;&nbsp;, latest paper, it thought for 30 minutes and just&nbsp;&nbsp;, moment, it was kind of seeing Lisa at all during&nbsp;&nbsp;, just going to keep happening more and more for&nbsp;&nbsp;, material science. The models [00:26:00] have&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, not very original because I think we've been doing&nbsp;&nbsp;, But yeah, just as somebody who had followed all&nbsp;&nbsp;, a sadness when you start seeing these models,&nbsp;&nbsp;, height of these achievement for these very&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, competitive programming. I was never at&nbsp;&nbsp;, way to get revenge, but I do think, no, there's&nbsp;&nbsp;, conscious performance while we were developing&nbsp;&nbsp;, of the program, they were not super great at&nbsp;&nbsp;, contest. And over time they just started creeping&nbsp;&nbsp;, you still remember that moment when you walk into&nbsp;&nbsp;, is, and then the models exceeded that. Man, that&nbsp;&nbsp;, automated to this level of capability so fast. And&nbsp;&nbsp;, within one or two months it was also surpassing&nbsp;&nbsp;, today. It's so clear by even through the results&nbsp;&nbsp;, top optimization competitive programmers in the&nbsp;&nbsp;, And so really it's jumped from hundredth place&nbsp;&nbsp;, we'll still be doing these competitions, &nbsp;, In 10 years?, &nbsp;, I think so. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;, of people who use it to had their resume or&nbsp;&nbsp;, people who've always excelled [00:28:00] at it&nbsp;&nbsp;, of it. And I don't think that'll go away., &nbsp;, When I was doing this story, I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;, or I don't, which countries that you basically&nbsp;&nbsp;, you want. I mean, I see the guys on the US team&nbsp;&nbsp;, okay, but it doesn't seem like the US has a, &nbsp;, Yeah, don't you think? Yeah. I mean interviews,&nbsp;&nbsp;, forward, and everyone's seeing this a little bit,&nbsp;&nbsp;, homework, it's all broken at this point. And I&nbsp;&nbsp;, and gauging who's performing what, who's learned&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, here where maybe for our interviews we&nbsp;&nbsp;, GPT, and it's a special kind of chat GPT,&nbsp;&nbsp;, the material [00:29:00] or whether you're at the&nbsp;&nbsp;, to have this conversation with it that convinces&nbsp;&nbsp;, can't be allowed to jailbreak it, and we look at&nbsp;&nbsp;, will more accurately reflect in the future., &nbsp;, So you don't do that yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, famous for doing the brain teasers during, &nbsp;, The interviews, &nbsp;, And everything. Yeah. [00:29:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;, I think, were you born on the East Coast?, &nbsp;, Yeah, born on the east coast., &nbsp;, And then you lived on the West Coast too, &nbsp;, On the west coast, &nbsp;, And then you lived in Taiwan for&nbsp;&nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;, Speaker 1:, &nbsp;, Speaker 2:, &nbsp;
