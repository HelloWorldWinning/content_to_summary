**一、核心思想提炼与总结**

本段文本围绕“时间揭示真相”的主题，通过引用戴维·艾克近30年前的预言和叙述者自身的经历，强调了在充满谎言的世界中识别可信信息来源的重要性。

**1. 戴维·艾克1996年的预言（近30年前）：**
    *   预见了一个“世界政府”的建立，国家将成为其行政单位。
    *   预测了“世界中央银行”将管理全球所有金融交易。
    *   提及“世界货币”将是纯粹的电子现金，对个人自由构成根本性威胁。
    *   预见了一个与全球计算机相连的“微芯片人口”。
    *   指出“世界卫生组织”会制造流行病恐慌（如麻疹），推动疫苗接种，并从中牟利。

**2. 叙述者个人经历与论证：**
    *   叙述者本人在几年前开始发声时，被广泛误解，遭受了“疯子”的称呼、仇恨和朋友的疏远，尤其在COVID期间因“说真话”而失去了许多朋友。
    *   强调“时间会揭示一切”的信念，并将其作为判断是非对错的永恒标准。
    *   认为现在是时候让人们看清谁在说真话，谁是值得信赖的。

**3. 对听众的建议与信任标准：**
    *   在当今充满谎言、欺诈和误导信息的复杂世界中，若想知道谁值得信任，应回顾过去三、四、五、二十甚至三十年来，那些无论当时听起来多么“疯狂”却坚持说出真相的人。
    *   指出这些人的预言现在已然成真或正在成为现实，因此他们才是真正值得信赖、并将继续引领方向的人。

**二、核心结论（一句话）：**
在充满谎言和虚假信息的世界中，值得信赖的人是那些长期以来坚持揭示“不受欢迎的真相”，且其预言如今已或正在被时间验证为现实的人。

**三、总体框架：**
“时间验证真相”：通过对比近30年前的预言与当今现实，结合个人受质疑的经历，论证了坚持说出“不受欢迎的真相”的重要性，并以此作为识别可信信息源和人物的框架。

 Take a look at this video from 1996, 28 years ago. David Eyeg speaking at an event. Take a look at this and tell me what you think. The creation of a one world government to which nation states would be principalities, administrative units, a world central bank which would administer all financial transactions on the planet, a world currency which wouldn't be coins and notes it would be merely electronic cash for society for which there are fundamental implications for freedom as we'll see as we go along tonight. And a microchip population linked to a global computer. So World Health Organization says there's going to be a measles epidemic next year. Get vaccinated. Get your children vaccinated. You're a bad parent if you don't. And the same people that organized that then stop blocking out the vaccine and make a fortune out of it. That was David Eyeg speaking almost 30 years ago and telling you what they were planning. Now listen guys, when I started speaking out a couple of years ago, I got called a lot of different names, a lot of hate came my way, a lot of people thought I was crazy. Everybody that was speaking out a few years ago, people thought you were crazy. I was speaking out during COVID. I lost so many friends. Like it was just crazy the people that turned on me for speaking the truth and trying to protect people that I cared about. They dropped off like flies. They turned their backs on me. It's now time. So I've let people, I've given people a couple of years to catch up and to see who was right, who was wrong. I don't care what people said. I don't care how many people were attacking, how loud the voices were that were coming at us. I don't care about his results. Time reveals all. I have a tattoo right on my arm because it never fails. It is always true. Time reveals all. So if you want to know who you can trust in today's crazy ass world full of liars and scammers and misinformation and purposeful misinformation, if you want to know who you can actually trust moving forward, look at the people over the last three, four, five, twenty years, thirty years that were speaking the truth, no matter how crazy it seemed to you at the time. And now it's all come true or is coming true as we speak. Those are the people that you can trust. Those are the people that are going to continue.
