### 总结要点

1.  **引言**:
    视频内容回顾了1996年大卫·艾克（David Icke）的一次演讲，其中他提出了一系列关于未来全球趋势的预言。

2.  **大卫·艾克的预言 (1996)**:
    *   **全球治理**: 预言将建立一个“一世界政府”，届时民族国家将沦为行政单位或“公国”。
    *   **全球金融**: 预言将出现一个“世界中央银行”，负责管理全球所有金融交易，并发行一种“世界货币”，该货币将仅以电子现金形式存在，这将对个人自由产生根本性影响。
    *   **人口控制**: 预言将出现“与全球计算机相连的微芯片人口”。
    *   **健康与利益**: 以世界卫生组织（WHO）推广疫苗接种为例（如麻疹疫情），指出其背后的组织者将从中获取巨额利润。

3.  **当前演讲者的论证**:
    *   **个人经历**: 演讲者分享了自己近年因“说出真相”而遭受的非议、仇恨、被视为“疯子”，尤其是在COVID期间因此失去了许多朋友和关系。他强调，早期那些发声的人都曾被认为“疯狂”。
    *   **核心信念**: 演讲者引用自己手臂上的纹身“时间揭示一切”，以此作为其核心信念。他认为，无论当初的反对声音多大，时间最终会证明谁是正确的。
    *   **识别可信赖信息源的标准**: 在一个充斥着谎言、欺骗和误导信息的“疯狂世界”中，演讲者建议，要识别真正值得信任的人，就应该回顾过去三、五、二十甚至三十年，那些当时看似“疯狂”却坚持说出真相、且其预言如今已被证实或正在实现的人。这些人才是真正可以信赖的信息来源。

### 核心观点

在一个充斥着谎言和虚假信息的世界里，真正值得信任的来源是那些多年来坚持说出当时看似疯狂但如今已被时间证明为真相的人。

### 总体框架

该内容通过对比历史预言与当前现实，倡导一种基于“时间验证真相”的批判性思维，旨在引导听众识别在复杂信息环境中真正可信赖的信息源。

 Take a look at this video from 1996, 28 years ago. David Eyeg speaking at an event. Take a look at this and tell me what you think. The creation of a one world government to which nation states would be principalities, administrative units, a world central bank which would administer all financial transactions on the planet, a world currency which wouldn't be coins and notes it would be merely electronic cash for society for which there are fundamental implications for freedom as we'll see as we go along tonight. And a microchip population linked to a global computer. So World Health Organization says there's going to be a measles epidemic next year. Get vaccinated. Get your children vaccinated. You're a bad parent if you don't. And the same people that organized that then stop blocking out the vaccine and make a fortune out of it. That was David Eyeg speaking almost 30 years ago and telling you what they were planning. Now listen guys, when I started speaking out a couple of years ago, I got called a lot of different names, a lot of hate came my way, a lot of people thought I was crazy. Everybody that was speaking out a few years ago, people thought you were crazy. I was speaking out during COVID. I lost so many friends. Like it was just crazy the people that turned on me for speaking the truth and trying to protect people that I cared about. They dropped off like flies. They turned their backs on me. It's now time. So I've let people, I've given people a couple of years to catch up and to see who was right, who was wrong. I don't care what people said. I don't care how many people were attacking, how loud the voices were that were coming at us. I don't care about his results. Time reveals all. I have a tattoo right on my arm because it never fails. It is always true. Time reveals all. So if you want to know who you can trust in today's crazy ass world full of liars and scammers and misinformation and purposeful misinformation, if you want to know who you can actually trust moving forward, look at the people over the last three, four, five, twenty years, thirty years that were speaking the truth, no matter how crazy it seemed to you at the time. And now it's all come true or is coming true as we speak. Those are the people that you can trust. Those are the people that are going to continue.
