Description:
**核心观点：**
生命追踪日志法是一种灵活、低摩擦的模拟日志系统，它通过结构化的月度习惯与目标追踪和自由形式的独立条目相结合，能有效促进自我反思、目标实现和对个人生活的长期记录。

**总体框架：**
该内容介绍了一种名为“生命追踪日志法”的混合式模拟日志系统，该系统融合了布莱特日志的结构化元素与个人化的灵活记录方式，旨在帮助用户系统性地追踪生活、优化习惯、实现目标并深入理解自我，最终构建一份丰富而持久的个人生命档案。

**总结：**

**1. 引言：生命追踪日志法**
*   一种高效且被低估的日志方法，是布莱特日志的改良版，专注于优化和追踪个人生活。
*   特点：摩擦力低，易于上手，已实践多年（作者已使用6年，填满5本，从20岁开始）。
*   偏好：选择实体日记本而非数字应用，认为其更能捕捉时间本质。
*   目的：系统地追踪睡眠、体重、习惯、阅读书籍等各类生活数据与思考。

**2. 工具与材料**
*   **推荐品牌：** Leuchtturm 1917 (灯塔 1917)。
*   **偏好格式：** 网格或点阵，因其模块化特性，便于绘制图表和捕捉多样化内容。

**3. 核心系统：月度页面（每月两页）**
*   **左页：日常追踪与亮点记录**
    *   **日期与星期：** 逐一列出当月日期及缩写（周一、周二等）。
    *   **习惯与指标追踪：**
        *   设置2-3行用于追踪每日习惯和指标（如体重、咖啡因摄入、锻炼、冥想）。
        *   追踪方式：通过填色（如喝咖啡）、画X（如跳过锻炼）等简单符号。
        *   益处：月末可直观评估习惯一致性，并分析其与特定指标（如体重）的关联。
        *   历史追踪示例：曾追踪睡眠时间（入睡与起床时间）。
    *   **每日亮点：**
        *   记录当天最值得记忆的一件事（如跑了10英里、PR、上传视频、与朋友聚会）。
        *   目的：快速回顾时能想起当天的主要事件。
    *   **益处：** 确保习惯的连贯性，并促使思考如何优化。
*   **右页：月度目标与计划**
    *   **月度目标/挑战：** 记录当月希望实现的目标或尝试的迷你挑战（如阅读五本书、30天挑战）。
    *   **提醒/计划：** 可记录重要的提醒或即将到来的行程。
    *   **特点：** 非待办事项清单，而是用来追踪正在做、正在思考和正在努力的事情。
    *   **益处：** 提供月度焦点，成为实验日志，便于长期回顾（可翻阅过去五年任何一天）。

**4. 辅助系统：独立条目（按需记录）**
*   **记录时机：** 随时随地，当有新的想法、需要思考某个问题或想捕捉所学知识时。
*   **格式：** 日期、时间，可自由发挥（如绘制图表、构思想法、总结书籍、捕捉所学）。
*   **灵感来源：** 达芬奇的日志，通过观察和学习记录一切。
*   **益处：** 增加精神清晰度，减少焦虑，优化生活；作为个人思想和学习的永久记录。
*   **无需强制：** 不必每天都写，月度页面是唯一尝试每日更新的部分（即使漏写几天也无妨，可事后回忆补齐）。

**5. 记录内容示例**
*   精力图、睡眠追踪、日本旅行步数与时间分配、日语沉浸式学习时长、吉他指法、钢琴笔记、书籍总结（如《从0到1》的关键学习点与引用）。

**6. 系统哲学与益处**
*   **起源：** 大学时期为捕捉想法和日常行动而创建，意识到记忆的短暂和不可靠。
*   **数字应用的局限：** 认为不存在“万能”的应用程序，因为个人兴趣和记录格式会不断变化。
*   **模拟日志的优势：** 格式灵活，可绘制图表、涂鸦、记录乐谱等，适应性强。
*   **目标实现：** 追踪目标进展是实现目标最有效的方式，量化指标越详尽，改进越容易。
*   **自我反思：** 物理记录能使人对习惯和行为更加自觉，促使贯彻目标。
*   **长期价值：** 渴望为生命中的每一年都留下一本日志，作为未来回顾不同年龄阶段思想的珍贵档案。
*   **遗憾：** 后悔未在20岁前开始。

**7. 使用建议**
*   无需担心是否能每日坚持，关键是开始。
*   坚持月度页面，并在各月之间按需添加独立日志条目或笔记。
*   购买一本笔记本，放在桌上，开始书写，直至写完。

 This is the life tracker system on the left you have the date Highlight of what you did and have a tracker and a metric tracker on the right You have your goal for the month and then after this you have One of the most powerful and also underrated things that you can do is actually journaling and today I want to share with you my journaling system, which I call the life tracker method It's a modification. I made to the bullet journal method to optimize and track my life I believe it's one of the lowest friction ways that you can start journaling and I've been doing this for the past six years. I filled five journals I buy a new one every single year and I've been doing this since I was age 20 There's just something about a physical journal that really captures the essence of that time I've tried using a bunch of different apps and digital ways of journaling and documenting my life, but I Always just come back to using pencil and pen I'm gonna show you the system that came up with to track things like my sleep my weight Different habits even the books that I'm reading but before we get into that Let me talk about my favorite journal brand that I actually use. Yeah, so I've tested a lot of different journal brands And I think the best one for my usage and for what I'm using for is this brand called LEC term 1917 I'm not actually sure how to pronounce it. I think it's a German word, but it's like L-L-E-U-C-H-T-U-R-M There's a bunch of different version and comes in like either grid or dotted and My favorite one is either a dotted one or a grid one And the reason for that is just because it's more modular when you have a grid or dotted like you can draw different diagrams You can capture a lot of different stuff. I'm gonna show you some of the stuff I've captured at the court of the system Every month I have a monthly page That is two pages. So I write the month on the left and the month on the right. So I just show you I'm gonna create Janneries page and then I'll have the number dates So I'll have the dates of Janner here on the left side and also put in in abbreviation for the day so Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday And then on the left side here, I'll have different metrics and habits that on track. So for example Right now I'm on a cut so I'll track my weight every day So I just put in like pounds here and I'll draw a line and then I can see my progress over different days And what I'll often do too is I'll track like two or three different habits Okay, so now we have three rows that we can use for tracking habits. So I'll just do one is like caffeine Maybe like work out And then meditation So If I drink caffeine, I'll just color it in and if I skip my workout, I'll just draw an X And I'll skip my if I skip my ratio And it's really cool because at the end of month you can just see how consistent you are with your habits And you can see how that correlates to any other metrics that you're trying So for a while I'll subtract my sleep times like I tracked when I went to bed when I woke up And that actually became like two whole pages But now I'm just tracking my weight and a caffeine usage workout meditation So like I'm only drinking caffeine every other day than maybe the next day. It's like this And the next day I'm like that And then on the left side here, I will write down the highlight of that day Like what made that day memorable? Like it could be like I ran 10 miles or I had a PR or I just uploaded a video But the point of this left side is just to kind of document the main highlight of that day So that if I read it, I can kind of see like oh, that's that's the day that I did that So like like hung out with friends This is pretty much it for the left side of the monthly page And then the next month I do this again And now I know like maybe I need to change my habits or I need to do a new strategy for these habits So this is a really effective way to really make sure that you're consistently the habits and also thinking about how to optimize for them So on the right side of the monthly page I usually I'll write down some of my goals for this month or some of the things I want to get accomplished I don't use my journal as a to-do list But I just use it to kind of track like what I'm doing what I'm thinking and some of the things I'm working on So I might have like you know read Five books And then maybe have the books here one two three four five and I'll write like so yeah super simple Just like something I want to keep in mind for the whole month It could also just be reminders or like trips coming up like once you actually start doing this and If you're like me you start actually doing this for multiple years It's really interesting because I can flip back to any given month in the past five years And you can see like on every single day like what is the highlight of that day? Did I follow through my habits on that day? And what were my goals on that year and that that date so This is like the easiest way to journal because rather than actually journaling every single day like what you did everything you did you're only journaling like one single line and Oh, so tracking like whether or not you hit your habits But after you've set up this page This is the page that I go to every single day in the morning or at night when I'm updating it Sometimes if I don't update it like for a week is totally fine too because I can usually just Think about like what I accomplished over the week So while you probably have your yearly goals or your decade long goals that you're working on These are just like monthly mini goals or like mini challenges that you want to try out and you can kind of like documents your experience kind of like a experiment log or a Laboratory journal so a lot of times I'll do like 30-day challenges like not for YouTube But like just for myself I'll do a 30-day challenge here and I'll track it and then I'll like journal about like my experience with doing that So after I set up the monthly page I'll usually have individual entries whenever I feel like journaling or there's something that I want to think about on paper And how I do that is that I'll just write like the date and then I'll write the time The beauty of a analog journal is that it can really be any format that you want So sometimes I'll be like drawing a diagram or for an idea that I have definitely the coolest thing is just being able to look back on any given date or Year and see what you were thinking about what kind of decisions you were trying to weigh and it really helps with increasing your mental clarity reducing anxiety and Just being able to optimize your life further It doesn't even have to be individual entries like sometimes I'll be summarizing a book that I read or capturing things that I've learned because this journaling system is really inspired by Leonardo da Vinci He's really known for his journals where he like writes down his observations or things that he's studying and it's really interesting Even now to look at some of the things that he's thinking about or some of the things that he was studying I think Bill Gates previously bought one of his journals for like 30 million dollars And you can create something like that for yourself too I also don't force myself to journal every day or even try to make it a habit I just write down stuff whenever some new thought comes to me or I just want to capture some sort of thing that I learned The monthly page is the only thing I try to update every single day But even I've missed a couple days It's still very fine because I can go back and think about what I did on that day and then fill it out I don't want to show the actual entries, but I want to show like some of the things that I've captured in my journals So like here's like an energy graph where I was like studying how I use my time And I noticed that I had this like different peaks and trough start the day And I kind of like raft this out that is an interesting thing just for myself to look at Here in July of 2021 I wrote down some my goals like read four books like do this new workout plan Sometimes I just doodle fun in my journals Here I actually like graphed out my sleep for I think this must be like around almost a month I graphed out my sleep like when I was going bed and when I was picking up And it was just really interesting to see like this kind of correlation based on like how much coffee I was making Sometimes I just like journal stuff just so I can document it and record it for the future because I know like Sometime in the future I'll look back and I'll be like nostalgic of this information Here I tracked like how many steps I was taking for a vacation to Japan and I wrote down like what I did every day Because he had many steps and I also like even tracked my time on the trips. I could see like it's been like 150 hours sleeping 23 hours exercising and still hit the gym Oh here I have a immersion tracker So this is also when I was studying Japanese I tracked like how many hours I was Spending on the language every day and you can see like on average just been being like almost three hours For these three weeks I was tracking you Yeah, I tracked down like a tar Riffs that I learned I also have some piano notes Sometimes when I finish a book that I think it's really good I'll also like write a one pager of everything that I learned and also just different quotes Um from there so this is after I finished the book zero to one I wrote down like a one pager of like some of the most impactful things that I learned from there I developed the system during college when I wanted to find a way to Capture not just the ideas I was having but also a way to capture what I was actually doing day-to-day So that I could just look back on it I realized how fleeting and unreliable my memory was And I was also really overwhelmed was trying to find the best all in one app that could help me capture everything about I care about At some point I realized that an app like that will probably never exist because My interests will constantly change and so the formats of my pages will never be the same year to year or even month-a-month Like sometimes I have a piano or guitar notation Other times I'll have a doodle or some sort of diagram that I'm drawing I would say if you're going to start journaling definitely don't worry about it If you're not doing it every day just keep the journal around do the monthly pages And in between the months you can add in different journal entries or just take notes on things that you are interested in But I also want to talk about another benefit of journaling and using this tracker method Which is that it can enable you to achieve Any goal that you set your mind to one of the most effective ways to set goals and achieve them is simply to track the progress of your goals over time The more metrics that you track the easier it is to quantify and improve And even though a lot of the metrics I'm tracking digitally like how I'm spending my time or what my weight is and how many steps I took I'm actually transferring that to my journal so I can flip to any month and see all these different metrics that I'm tracking When you don't do self introspection or document the reality of your habits and actions It's really easy to just forget about them and move on to the next month But when you just document them and write them down in a physical place You become more conscious of them and following through with your goals become way easier Like I found that there's a huge difference between just stepping on the scale versus stepping on the scale and then copying that number Onto a journal. It's also really interesting to see how I track different metrics throughout different ages Like one year I tracked my net worth super closely every single month And in the past year I've been super interested in tracking my fitness and health metrics and seeing correlations there Here I actually tracked my wake time sleep time and the steps I was taking every day And I intend on doing this forever. I want to have a notebook for every year of my life So I can just pull a journal off the bookshelf and see what I was thinking at age 25 35 or even 50 My only regret is that I didn't start this earlier before the age of 20 So if you're considering journaling this year, I would highly recommend it And even if you don't know how consistent you'll be with it Just buy a notebook put on your table and just write in it until you finish it Hope this journaling method can help you optimize your life. See you in the next one Peace
