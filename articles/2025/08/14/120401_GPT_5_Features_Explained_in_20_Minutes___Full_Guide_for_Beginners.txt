Chat GPT has officially arrived. Oh my god. Yeah, it's here. And it's a massive leap forward for ChatGpt users. Sam Alman even compares the jump from GPT4 to 5 to upgrading from a pixelated screen to retina display. In practical terms, he says using GPT5 really feels like talking to a PhD level expert on any topic. In this guide, we'll break down everything that's new in GPT5, from its unified model design to new superpowers like giant memory, advanced coding, and more. And by the end, you'll know exactly how to make the most of its new features. So, let's dive in. One of the first things you'll notice is that Chad GBT now has just one GPT5 model option. No more guessing between GBT4, 40, 03 Pro, or other models. GPT5 unifies all those into single model. So, the confusion model picker menu is gone. Why is this a big deal? Previously, users had to manually switch models for different tasks. For example, a reasoning model for step-by-step logic versus a creative model for writing. Now, GBT5's main brain automatically does it all. Behind the scenes, OpenAI builds a smart router that decides when GBT5 should think harder using chain of thought reasoning. Just open Chad GBT and start a new chat. There's no drop down to toggle models anymore. For example, I typed a question, "How can I improve customer engagement on my website? " GBT5 gave a quick structured answer. If I ask a follow-up question like, "Can you analyze this data for me? " The same model seamlessly handles it, possibly invoking its reasoning mode behind the scenes. If you need a quick and simple answer in reasoning mode, you can choose at any time by clicking the pop-up. No manual switch, and needed one model to rule them all. GBT5 also dramatically expands the amount of information. All GBT5 models can accept a maximum of 272, 000 input tokens and emit a max of 128, 000 reasoning and output tokens. For a total context length, 400, 000 tokens. To put that in perspective, it is roughly 200, 000 words or about a 700page book. You can drop entire documents, lengthy reports or code bases into Chad GBT5 and it can read all of it without losing track. It's like having a photographic memory for text. To see the context power, I pasted a 100page PDF worth of text. Yes, I literally dumped a huge text document into Chad GBT with GPT5. I then asked, "Summarize the key recommendations from this report and give me an action plan. " Astonishingly, GPT5 processed it all and provided a detailed summary with an action plan referencing points from throughout the document. No, sorry, that's two long errors. It handled approximately 100 pages in one go where older models would have choked. Additionally, GPT5 is getting smarter about persistent personal memory. In other words, it won't forget those details every new chat unless you wanted to. You'll have the ability to mute that cross chat memory for privacy when needed. For the memory aspect, I tried telling GBT5 early in a chat. My dog's name is Buddy and my company launched in 2020. Many messages later, I asked, "Remind me who Buddy is. " GBT5 correctly answered, "Buddy is your dog. " A small example of it retaining details. With GBT, chat GBT feels more aware of context and details over long stretches. Just remember, if you prefer not carry info between chats, you can adjust those settings. GBT5 comes with built-in web browsing capabilities that are on by default. Unlike older chat GBT, which had a separate browse mode, GBT5 will automatically pull in fresh info from the web when the question needs it. You no longer have to append use the web to your prompt or flip any toggles. GBT5 just knows when to search. For example, if you ask about today's news or recent event, will connect to the internet, find the info, and give you an answer with sources. GBT5 can search the web on the fly and even site sources for factual answers. In this example, it looked up information on statin medications and provided a list of follow-up questions complete with references from reputable sources in the answer. Another cool improvement, when GPT5 sites info, it often gives you a clickable reference or a brief preview, as shown in the statin answer screenshot above. This helps you trust but verify. You can check the source of the AI's information easily. I tried asking GBT5, "What's the latest on the Mars rover mission? " Immediately, GBT responded with something like, "Searching for the latest updates on Perseverance Rover. " After a few seconds, it answered with the rover's current status, citing a NASA update from this week. The answer had a little reference link to the NASA article. I didn't have to prompt it to do that. It knew to search. Next, I asked a question about stock market trends as of today. Again, GBT5 fetched the realtime info and summarize the market movement. Quote an example source. I know all these new GBT capabilities sound exciting, but you know, a bit overwhelming. AI headlines scream layoffs and automation eats jobs. Meanwhile, you're drowning in tabs, tutorials, and tool of the week hype. Whether you freelance, clock in 9 to5, or build a business, the real pain is falling behind while others ship faster with AI. You want more sales, more clients, smaller workload, but not another stack of courses. That's exactly why we built AI Master Pro. Three universal tracks that turn you into an AI powered version of yourself. one 99% ready system with plug-and-play prompts and workflows. The only missing piece is your perspective. It's the same framework I use to go from a cameraman to media entrepreneur with an AI run video business that scripts, edits, and sells for me. And now this is your chance to start landing clients faster, ship deliverables in hours, and scale without extra hires. Watch a complete free lesson today. Hit the link and start using AI instead of worrying about it. GPT5 isn't just a text genius. It's pushing further into multimodal capabilities. Multimodal means it can handle multiple types of inputs, outputs, text, images, audio, and more. GPT4 already introduced image understanding, and GPT4's O version could generate images. GPT5 takes this to the next level by combining all these skills in one model. What's new on the image front? For one, image generation got a solid upgrade. GPT5 can create images more reliably with cleaner text rendering in images, better scene composition, and even handling multi- language text and images. Some of the quirks that tripped up GBT4's image generator, like jumbo text and signs or odd framing, have been improved. So, when you ask GBT to make an image, for example, generate a poster for my event or create a logo with my company name, you'll likely see sharper results with correct lettering and layout. It's not perfect art every time, but it's noticeably better and can even render legible text in the image in various languages, something older models struggled with. On the image understanding side, GPT5 is more accurate and context aware. You can upload a photo or diagram, and GBT5 can discuss it intelligently. It even catches details or inconsistencies. For instance, I showed GBT5 a picture of a plant and asked why my snake plant looks yellow. GBT5 correctly noted the picture was actually a cactus, not a snake plant. and then proceeded to give advice on snake plants turning yellow. That kind of nuance, recognizing the wrong plant in the photo, shows how much better it is at vision tasks. It's not just images. GPT5 is geared up to handle audio and even video. While at launch, you might not yet generate a full video inside Chat GPT. The architecture is late for it. OpenAI hints that GBT will have full support for videos and richer audio handling, unifying all media types in one AI. This could mean future updates where you can input a video clip for analysis or GBT 5 might help edit generate video content. So expect multimodal expansions perhaps voice notes to chat GBT video summaries or AI generated short videos down the road all under the GPT5 umbrella. For now practical uses include uploading images of charts or tables for analysis. GBT5 is better at parsing data tables too. using the microphone input on the chat GBT mobile app for voice conversations which GBT5 handles with its personalities as we'll see. >> Absolutely. Let's roll with a snappy lasagna recipe that feels like you're talking to a friend >> and generating images within conversations without needing special plugins. I gave a GBT an image photo of a handdrawn business model sketch and I asked, "Can you interpret this diagram and suggest improvements? " GPT5 analyzed the image and returned a breakdown of the sketch's elements, boxes, arrows, notes, and actually provided constructive suggestions. It said things like, "It looks like your user acquisition flow is drawn here. One improvement could be to clarify this section. This shows off the improved vision to text capability. " Next, I tried an audio experiment using the mobile app. I spoke a question, explained quantum computer in simple terms. GBT5 not only transcribed my speech accurately, but answered in a clear, simplified manner. In other words, while your normal computer is stuck doing things one by one, a quantum computer can juggle lots of possibilities all at once. It's like having a super flexible cheat code for certain types of problems. >> It felt like a natural conversation, especially since I have the listener persona on. More on persona soon, which made it respond in a patient, supportive tone. These multimodal interactions make Chad GBT feel less like a text box and more like a versatile assistant you can talk to and show things to. Chad GBT with 03 was already a coder's best friend, but GBT5 is on a whole new level when it comes to coding. Sam Alton flat out calls GBT5 the best model in the world at coding. It's faster, more capable, and writes cleaner code with fewer hints. In OpenAI's testing, GBT5 outperformed all previous models on tough code and benchmarks. It's not just about code accuracy. It's also about what Altman describes as software on demand. Basically, you can now describe an app or program you want. And GPT5 can generate a working version of it from scratch. During a demo for reporters, OpenAI showed GPT5 built a complete French language learning web app with an interactive game from a single paragraph prompt. The AI produced hundreds of lines of code, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. Assembled them, and the result was a functional website. >> Whoa. >> Oh, nice. >> All in one go in just a couple of minutes. That's the power of GBT5's coding abilities. It doesn't just write a snippet. It can architect an entire small application with minimal guidance. And importantly, it's doing it with fewer bugs. Observers noted the app ran on first try with very few errors whereas earlier models often needed a few rounds of debugging. If you are into coding, here are some highlights of GBT5's upgrade. Better understanding of instructions. It follows detailed requirements more faithfully. You can specify certain architecture or library and GBT will use it. Longer code handling. Thanks to that large context, GBT5 can keep track big code base. can read multiple files or a long code file and reason about it as a whole. Improved debugging or explaining GPT5 is more effective at finding bugs in code and suggesting fixes. It's also great at explaining code helpful for code review or learning tool use can utilize the advanced code interpreter now called advanced data analysis and chat GPT more effectively for running code meaning can actually execute and test the programs it writes when in that mode. agentic actions in coding. It not only writes code, but if you allow it, GBT5 can run a sequence of tool calls like calling API, fetching documentation, etc. to complete code and task. It's more autonomous in figuring out how to get the job done, not just writing code blindly. I decided to put GBT 5 to the test by asking it to create a simple web app. My prompt, create a simple to-do list web app with user login and dark mode. use HTML, CSS, JS, and explain how to deploy it. GBT5 took a few seconds thinking. Then boom, it produced the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a to-do app. It even included comments explaining each part. It also gave instructions at the end. You can save these files and open the HTML in a browser. To add login, you'd normally need a server, but here's a simple simulation, etc. The code wasn't 100% production ready security-wise, but it worked when I tried it. I simply copied the code into files and opened the page. There was no to-do app with a dark mode toggle. This was done with one prompt. Previously, I might have had to iterate with the AI or fix things manually, but GBT5 handled it in one shot. For a debugging test, I gave GBT5 a piece of code with an error. It identified the bug quickly and corrected the code, explaining the fix. The clarity of the explanation was better than before. It feels like you're working with a competent pair programmer who can articulate what's wrong and how to fix it. Altogether, GBT5's code and prowess means faster development, quick prototyping, and even non-coders can create basic software by just describing what they need. It's like having a software engineer on call 24/7. That said, human oversight is still important. You want to review and test code for critical applications, but the time saved is immense. Ever wish Chad GBT had a bit more personality? With GBT5, it does. OpenAI added personalities feature that lets you choose the style in which Chad GBT responds. There are four preset personas so far. Cynic, robot, listener, and nerd. Each one tweaks the tone and attitude of GBT's answers. Cynic, snarky, critical, and sarcastic. This one will give you a bit of sass or dry humor in responses. might be fun when you want a brutally honest opinion or just a laugh. Robot, efficient, blunt, and super logical. It strips out the fluff and gets straight to the point. Almost like Spock from Star Trek. No nonsense. Listener, thoughtful, supportive, and friendly. It's empathetic and patient. Great for advice or more personal questions where you want a considerate tone. Nerd. Enthusiastic and detailoriented. This persona loves deep dives and may infuse some goofy, excited energy about technical details or trivia. Think of it as your geeky friend who's excited about everything. By default, if you choose nothing, GPT5 has a balanced neutral but helpful tone, the default personality. But if you want to spice things up or tailor the assistant style to the context, say using synic for a tongue-in-cheek take or listener for counseling, you can. Users can select these in settings and it's easy to switch back if you don't like one. The personalities are optin and adjustable anytime so you won't get sarcasm unless you explicitly choose it. I decided to try the different personalities by asking the same question in four modes and the question give me tips on improving my public speaking in default normal mode. GBT5 gave a very balanced answer organized tips about practice knowing your audience using body language etc in a professional tone. I switched to cynic and asked again. This time the answer started with, "Record yourself then survive the cringe. " With a witty, somewhat sarcastic flavor. It still offered tips, but with tongue-in-cheek comments like, "Slow down before you accidentally rap. " Next robot persona. The reply was succinct and blunt. Know your material well. Record and watch yourself. Use simple words. It felt like bullet points from a hyperefficient AI, which is actually useful if you want just the facts. Finally, listener persona. The tone here was very encouraging. If you want, I can give you a short daily drill that will build public speaking confidence fast. It was supportive and even used a bit of personal touch and style. There's also a fun cosmetic touch. You can change the chat theme color for each conversation. It's a minor thing, but it helps visually organize or just personalize your chats. Maybe red for urgent work queries, green for personal learning, etc. It's nice to see OpenAI making the interface more userfriendly and customizable. Another transformative upgrade with GBT5 is how it can act more like a true personal assistant thanks to new integrations with external apps and smoother agent abilities. The first wave of this is integration with Google services starting with Gmail, Google Calendar, and contacts. If you're a Chad GBT Pro user, you can now link these accounts and GBT 5 will automatically use them when relevant. What does this mean in practice? ask, "Do I have any meetings Friday? " And it will look at your calendar and answer. Say, "Draft an email to my client thanking them for the meeting. " And it will compose a message, maybe even pull in details from that meeting's notes if available. Beyond Google apps, the architecture suggests more connectors will come, perhaps Microsoft 365, Trello, Slack, or other productivity tools. So, GPT5 could become a hub that ties all your info together. For now, AI automations for business work in a bit different way. And that's why we broke down the basic step by step in our latest AI master pro course. So don't forget to check it out. Chat GBT is moving in the direction of being an AI agent that doesn't just chat, but takes actions to help you get stuff done. With GBT, it's much better at actually completing each step and letting you know what it's doing. Can use built-in tools like browsing, code execution, calculators in sequence without fumbling. For example, I gave GBT5 a task. Find the latest population of Canada, put it into bar chart comparing it to the US population, and email me the chart. Ambitious, right? Here's what happened. GBT5 searched the web for latest population figures. It cited World Bank data it found. It then wrote some Python code using the advanced data analysis tool to create a bar chart of Canada versus USA populations. It actually executed the code, generated a chart image and showed it to me in the chat. Then it drafted an email subject population chart body text describing the chart and mentioned it would send the chart PNG file. Since I hadn't Gmail linked, it asked for confirmation like to email it to you. I need to open your email service and attach the chart. This was mindblowing. I basically gave one command that spanned web research, coding, and email. And GPT5 orchestrated it all. It truly felt like a personal assistant who knew how to use the computer on my behalf. GBT5 supports scheduled tasks in a smoother way instead of requiring a special schedule plugin or writing chron expressions. You can tell GBT5 something like remind me in 2 days to follow up with John. And if it's integrated with your calendar or reminder system, it will set that up. The idea in plain English commands like every Monday at 9: 00 summarize my new emails are becoming feasible. I connected my Google account in chat GBT. Next I said schedule a lunch meeting with Bob sometime next week. GBT5 checked my calendar availability and Bob's email from contacts. Then it proposed, how about Wednesday at 12: 30 p. m. I'll send an invite to Bob. I said go ahead and sent a calendar invite through my Google calendar. Bob actually got the invite email. I was floored for email drafting. I tried draft an email to our project manager thanking her for the successful product launch and mentioned we achieved a 20% increase in signups. Instantly, GBT5 wrote a nice three paragraph email with a positive tone and the key details. It even put a subject line, great work on the product launch, and signed my name at the end. All I had to do was skim and hit send. This kind of integration saves so much time for routine tasks and demonstrates GBT5's potential as an executive assistant. While these features are initially for higher tier users, you can expect them to trickle out wider as they prove safe and reliable. Always remember you stay in control. GBT5 will usually confirm actions like sending an email or book in something before finalizing. Is GBT5 perfect? Not at all. It's not the mythical AGI yet. As Alman himself notes, it doesn't learn by itself on the fly. It can still make mistakes or require human guidance, but it's a significant step forward. If you've been using Chat GBT for a while, GBT5 will feel like a supercharged familiar friend. You don't have to radically change how you prompt or interact. Good prompting practices still apply, but everything just works better and with less friction. And if you're new to ChatGBT, there's never been a better time to start since the model is smarter and more userfriendly than ever. We are in the early days of the GBT5 era and no doubt OpenAI and the community will continue discovering new tricks and use cases as GBT becomes integrated into more tools and platforms. Expect the AI to quietly weave itself into many apps you use from office suites to coding environments all offering this level of intelligence on tap.
