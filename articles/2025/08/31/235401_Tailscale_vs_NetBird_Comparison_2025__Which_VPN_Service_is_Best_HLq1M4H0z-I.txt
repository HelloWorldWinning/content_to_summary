以下是对Tailscale和NetBird对比内容的总结：

### 总体框架

本文通过对Tailscale和NetBird这两种基于WireGuard的网状VPN解决方案进行六个关键维度的比较分析，旨在帮助用户根据自身组织需求选择合适的网络安全工具。

### 核心结论

Tailscale和NetBird的选择取决于对便利性（Tailscale）或控制与灵活性（NetBird）的优先考量。

### 结构化摘要

**I. 引言**
*   对比Tailscale和NetBird，两者均是提供安全私有网络的软件。
*   基于六个类别进行比较：目的、主要功能、最佳适用对象、定价、易用性、集成。

**II. 产品对比**

1.  **目的**
    *   **Tailscale:** 简单、安全、可扩展的WireGuard网状VPN，主要侧重于创建配置最少的点对点私有网络。
    *   **NetBird:** 类似Tailscale，也是基于WireGuard的开源网状VPN，提供安全私有网络，并额外强调自托管和成本效益。

2.  **主要功能**
    *   **Tailscale:** 零配置VPN，自动对等发现，集中协调服务器（Tailscale服务器），多平台支持（Linux、macOS、Windows、Android、iOS等），通过身份提供商（如Google、Microsoft）进行用户身份验证，NAT穿越和自动加密连接。
    *   **NetBird:** 开源并具备自托管能力，内置访问控制和网络分段，使用WireGuard实现高性能加密，自托管时无需依赖外部协调服务器，提供灵活的部署选项。

3.  **最佳适用对象**
    *   **Tailscale:** 适合寻求即插即用安全网络解决方案、不愿管理服务器的中小型企业或团队。
    *   **NetBird:** 适合偏爱开源自托管解决方案或需要对基础设施有更多控制权的组织。

4.  **定价**
    *   **Tailscale:**
        *   Starter选项：每活跃用户每月6美元。
        *   可选附加项：Molepad（每月5美元/Molepad，最多5台设备），附加设备（每设备每月0.50美元）。

 Hello everyone! In today's video I'm going to show you a brief comparison of tail scale and net bird. So first up you can type in tail scale and net bird on your browser whether that's on your computer or mobile and you'll be able to see their landing page right here. So just copy or type in this URL and this one for net bird. Now both of these are actually software that facilitates secure and private networking and we're going to be comparing these two VPNs based on six categories which are purpose key features best for pricing ease of use and integration. So starting with tail scale and its purpose tail scale is a simple secure and scalable mesh VPN built on WireGuard. It mainly focuses on creating private peer-to-peer networks with minimal configuration. Now with net bird it actually is similar to tail scale in the sense that it's also an open source mesh VPN built on WireGuard. They offer secure private networks with additional emphasis on self-posting and cost efficiency. Now for the key features of tail scale. So first we have the zero config VPN with automatic peer discovery. They also have a centralized coordination server. So this is this is encompassed by tail scale servers. It has multi-platform support like Linux, Mac OS, Windows, Android, iOS and more and it also has the user authentication be identity providers for example Google and Microsoft and NAT traversal and auto-encrypted connections. Now for net bird you have open source with self-hosting capabilities built in access control and network segmentation uses WireGuard for high performance encryption no reliance on external coordination servers if self-hosted and flexible deployment options. Now what exactly is tail scale best for? So tail scale is best for small to medium businesses or teams seeking a plug and play solution for secure network without managing servers. Now as for net bird this is more for organizations that prefer an open source self-hosted solution or need more control over the infrastructure. So now let's try to compare both of these when it comes to their pricing offers. So starting with tail scale we have the pricing right over here. Now for their starter option you have six dollars per active user per month and these are the inclusions. They also have some optional add-ons here and you can also see their cloud market places in this section and if you have any particular questions when it comes to their pricing they have an FAQ section right below. So you see their optional add-ons per mole bad five dollars per month per mole bad on up to five devices and add-on devices at zero point fifty dollars per device per month. Now let's try to check how net bird compares so their pricing is right here. So first up for individuals or small teams looking for an easy to use and secure connectivity this is actually they actually have a free option and these are the inclusions for that free option. You can see that it's up to five users and a hundred machines now for team. This is for teams and organizations looking to replace legacy VPNs for secure remote access and site-to-site connectivity at five dollars per user per month. Now for business this is for organizations looking to strengthen their network security with the modern zero trust approach. So this is at twelve dollars per user per month. They also have a pricing calculator here if you want to see the actual breakdown per plan and how many active users you're planning to have as well as your active machines. So pretty convenient feature that allows you to measure up before you actually purchase their service. So as you can see net bird actually offers a bit more pricey options. However you're in you're more in control with their options since you can actually include the amount of members you're going to have and for tail scale you only have add-ons at one specific plan. But again if you're going to use it for personal personal uses they both offer a free option if you just want to try them out. But again for business for business needs then you're looking at around six dollars per active user per month. Well this one for five so you can see the difference between the two options. Now let's move on to ease of use. Tail scale is extremely user friendly with a seamless setup process especially for non-technical users. As for net bird it has a more technical setup again since you have more control just based on their pricing alone. It's more technical and especially since it's more centered on self-hosted deployments but again it offers greater control. Now when it comes to integration tail scale integrates with cloud providers identity platforms and Kubernetes as for net bird they support cloud native environments self-hosted setups and custom integrations. So in summary you'd best choose tail scale for simplicity ease of setup and a managed solution with minimal overhead. Now for net bird this is for an open source self-hosted alternative that provides more control over your networking infrastructure. Now both tools leverage wire guard for security and performance but tail scale prioritizes convenience while net bird focuses on flexibility and self-hosting. And that's it for today thanks for tuning in and I'll see you next time.
