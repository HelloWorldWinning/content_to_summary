Gizmologi.id > Paper > News > How to Subscribe to ChatGPT Plus for 3 Months Free Using ShopeeVIP News Tips How to Subscribe to ChatGPT Plus for 3 Months Free Using ShopeeVIP By Prasetyo Herfianto August 13, 2025 11:55 Share 4 MinRead SHARE Jakarta, Gizmologi – Good news for those of you who find it difficult to spend Rp 300 on a premium ChatGPT subscription. Now you can take advantage of a free ChatGPT Plus subscription. The duration is also substantial, lasting up to three months, saving you Rp 3, or nearly Rp 960 million. Recently, OpenAI just updated its large language model (LLM) the latest via GPT-5 . And when it was first released, only ChatGPT Plus and Pro users had access to it. If you want full access, there's now a free 3-month ChatGPT Plus subscription offer through ShopeeVIP. Yes, as part of its efforts to win customers over the national e-commerce competition, Shopee Indonesia is offering attractive additional benefits for those who subscribe to ShopeeVIP—in a way, to compete with Tokopedia Plus, which also offers many of its own benefits. Interestingly, one of the ShopeeVIP benefits is the free ChatGPT Plus version. ChatGPT is free, allowing anyone to send various prompts and upload files for data analysis. However, unlike ChatGPT Plus and Pro, access is limited, meaning there's a time limit for each use. So, how do you get a free ChatGPT subscription through Shopee?

As mentioned above, you can receive the benefits of a free ChatGPT subscription by subscribing to ShopeeVIP. By paying Rp 29, you'll immediately receive a three-month promotional offer for ChatGPT Plus. If you're already a ShopeeVIP subscriber, the option to try ChatGPT for free will appear immediately—if not, you can access the ShopeeVIP page via the "Me" tab in the Shopee app on your smartphone. In the "other benefits" section, you'll find 3 months of free ChatGPT Plus, which you can access directly from that menu. Simply log in and Shopee will automatically attach a special promo code, to be able to subscribe for Rp0 for three months. Once you've done that, you can enjoy the ChatGPT Free Plus experience. Compared to the free version, some of the benefits include priority access during peak traffic times, higher limits for accessing GPT-5 and other flagship models, and faster responses in chat mode. Not only that, you can also enjoy various other features, such as voice chat mode, creating images through text input, uploading and analyzing documents, and deep research features. Plus, you'll also have limited access to Sora's video creation, which has recently become increasingly popular for use and sharing on social media. ChatGPT Plus Free Subscription is Auto-Renewable A small note: Even though you get free access to ChatGPT Plus, you'll still be asked for compatible credit or debit card information. After three free months, OpenAI will charge you $20 per month to continue your subscription—make sure you cancel before the bill is issued. And of course, free ChatGPT access isn't the only benefit of a ShopeeVIP subscription. Users can enjoy up to hundreds of special free shipping vouchers, including instant delivery. Plus, discount vouchers and other discounts can also be applied to ShopeeFood. - Advertisement - Read more: Sam Altman: OpenAI's GPT-5 Has PhD-Level Intelligence, Minimal Hallucinations Explore other content from Gizmologi.id Subscribe to get the latest posts by email.
