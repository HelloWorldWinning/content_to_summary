**摘要大纲**

1.  **引言**
    *   独立媒体的持续施压，迫使白宫回应唐纳德·特朗普的健康状况，引发了对其健康问题的更多关注。
2.  **官方健康声明**
    *   白宫医疗部门经过全面检查，诊断特朗普患有“慢性静脉功能不全”，并声称这是一种“良性”且“常见”的病症。
3.  **独立医生分析与诊断**
    *   一位医生根据公开观察和官方声明，推测特朗普的真实病症是“充血性心力衰竭”和“慢性肾脏病”。
    *   **诊断依据：**
        *   脚和脚踝严重肿胀。
        *   为掩盖肿胀，在公众场合多采取坐姿。
        *   手部出现瘀伤并用化妆品遮盖，这被认为是使用静脉利尿剂的迹象。
    *   **医生预测：** 该医生悲观地预测特朗普的寿命可能“最多六到八个月”。
4.  **其他身体健康迹象**
    *   右腿存在持续性问题。
    *   照片中出现疑似导尿管的迹象，暗示可能存在排尿困难。
    *   “Kinkles”（脚踝严重肿胀）是长期存在的明显健康问题。
    *   行走困难，步态不稳，无法走直线。
5.  **认知能力下降迹象**
    *   语言混乱，例如将亚美尼亚和阿塞拜疆与阿尔巴尼亚混淆。
    *   重复性言语，如多次提及“一片叫做海洋的广阔水域”。
    *   这些表现被解读为可能存在“痴呆症”的迹象。
6.  **结论**
    *   所有累积的证据，包括官方承认的健康问题、独立的医学推测、明显的身体和认知退化迹象，以及特朗普本人提及“天堂”的言论，都强烈暗示其健康状况正在经历显著且严重的恶化。

 We got some breaking news. There are some alarming pictures that just came out that raise more questions about Donald Trump's health. Now, I have a lot of photos here to go through, but first we also know Donald Trump's health is not great because the White House was forced to talk about this after mainstream media failed to put pressure on them, but independent media put the pressure on and they were forced to talk about it. That's why it's so important to hit like on this video and subscribe because we can get results the way that mainstream media and corporate media cannot. Here is Caroline Levitt having to talk about the fact that Donald Trump is not doing well. Since of caution, this concern was thoroughly evaluated by the White House Medical Unit. The president underwent a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies. Bilateral lower extremity vent venous Doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, AB 9 in common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70. Okay, so they're saying it's benign, but I have some reporting here from a doctor who has seen Donald Trump. Obviously, he can't examine Donald Trump directly, but seeing what he has seen and knowing what she said, here's what this doctor has to say about Donald Trump's condition. And he thinks that Donald Trump actually has congestive, congestive heart failure. Dr. did in my field. I see congestive heart failure patients on a daily basis. The reason I know that he has congestive heart failure is because of the swelling in his feet and ankles. And the reason I know it's getting worse is because he's sitting behind the desk on camera now. He lashed out against MSNBC for giving him hash about his ankles. This is how we know that something is true because it gets to Trump. Remember recently where he was talking about going to heaven for some fucking reason? His people said I'm not doing very well. I don't think he's talking about the media. I think he's talking about the doctors who are treating him. The only reason his health has been maintained at all is because he has the privilege of getting IV diuretics, spironolactone, lasex, bumax, something like that. That's why his hands have been bruised and covered with makeup. Badly, I might add. We know that it's getting worse because he knows he cannot hide the degree of swelling. That's why he's sitting behind the desk. Oh, he also has chronic kidney disease, which is also contributing to the swelling in the feet and ankles. I can't tell you how many times I have seen a patient in their home because they were hospitalized for AKI or acute kidney injury. And the kidney injury was caused by nephrotoxic medications, namely diuretics, spironolactone, bumax, lasex. The president is definitely getting sicker. And we know he's not going to change his diet because he's such a fucking idiot. I think he's going to be around for six to eight months tops. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Well, that's one person's opinion, but as, as he said, this is very obvious because Donald Trump has been taking photos of many times where the makeup on his hand is just completely obvious. My question is about all of these photos is, and you can kind of see it there. If that's like, if they are deciding that this is better, this is better to do than to just show the bruising. Like how bad is the bruising? Now, there's a new photo that came out and this is it. This is it where Donald Trump was at some sort of event looking like shit. And here is this photo. It literally looks like it looks like wall paint. It looks like wall paint. He is the president of the United States. He cannot find a makeup artist to skin match his hand. And I truly am like, is this better than just seeing the bruising? This is terrible. It's awful. But as that doctor said, there's a reason for it. And it's because he is not doing well. And we also know that Donald Trump has had a problem with his right leg as you can see here. It's been an ongoing problem with his health. And we also know we've reported on this before where Donald Trump had this photo and this I'm sorry to make you look is not the president's member. People are speculating that that is the president's catheter. Here's a little bit more on that. Whoever took this picture knew what the fuck they was doing. It's no reason why they didn't crop this out. So not only can our president not make it to number two, he can't make it to the bathroom for number one either because that right there is a catheter. Confirmation. That's a catheter y'all. So shitty pants is pissy too. They could have cropped that out. And we noticed not his his eggplant because he didn't already hit the debacle of a girl talking about his mushroom micro-pene better her saying it than me. And of course Donald Trump is just there's clear clear and clear signs that are recent now of Donald Trump and his mind slipping. The abber by John I was a big one going on for 34 35 years with Albania. Think of that. I mean going on for years. So he meant Armenia in Azer by John there not Abber by John in Albania. And here's another one where he's talking about the ocean and it just couldn't be more clear that grandpa is just losing his mind. The other leaders tell you because it seemed to be this is unlike the first Trump term. There was great unity that was there and we saw their public comments but when you got them in the Oval Office and we have this photo of you sitting at the Resolute desk and all of these world leaders are sitting in front of you. What did they say to you privately because it looked like they're on the same page as you sir. Yeah they are they're very good people. They're very good leaders of their countries and they want to get back to leading their country. You know they're consumed far more with this than we are because they're right there. You know we have an ocean that's separating us right. Think called an ocean a big big beautiful ocean. A thing called an ocean a big beautiful ocean and this is another clear sign that I mean I'll call dementia we don't know we don't know looks like it but this is one of the signs of dementia and you can't walk in a straight line. Definitely something going on there. Definitely and of course we have seen these bad boys many times now where the kinkles which is actually look at that look at that where this is the thing that started at all where there's clear problems with the president's health that his kinkles his ankles look like that. So I do think it's interesting that there are all there's all this smoke right. I mean we heard from one doctor who basically said he has six to eight months to live. I can't speculate on that. I'm not a doctor. I don't see patients. This person would know more than I do but certainly there's a lot of smoke. There's a lot of smoke and the fact that Donald Trump is talking about trying to get into heaven leads me to believe that for some reason death is on the president's mind and I suppose we don't know why that is but all these pictures the hand the ankles the White House confirming that he has health issues and we know Donald Trump doesn't want anyone to think he's less than perfect so all this stuff adds up to me as something is going on. We just don't know specifically what yet but thank you for watching you feel like this video please hit like on the video if you're not subscribed please consider subscribing and I'll see you next time. See the alright nice
