## 总结报告

### 1. 内容大纲与结构

本文由杰瑞·怀斯（Jerry Wise）根据其45年的经验，详细列举了自恋型父母养育的成年子女普遍拥有的25种常见特质。这些特质深刻影响着他们在成人期的情感、人际关系和自我认知。内容结构清晰，首先介绍背景和专家资质，然后逐一阐述每项特质及其具体表现，最后引导受众寻求解决方案和支持。

#### 25种常见特质：

1.  **取悦他人：** 认为爱与接纳必须通过牺牲自己、将他人置于自身之前来赢得。
2.  **过度关注他人情绪：** 不断扫描他人情绪变化，常以牺牲自身感受为代价，可能表现为过度共情。
3.  **过度道歉：** 即使不是自己的错也过度道歉，甚至为无法控制的事情道歉。
4.  **决策困难：** 对所有事情过度思考，害怕做出错误选择，尤其在重大人生选择上。
5.  **低自我价值与慢性自我怀疑：** 感觉永远不够好，不断质疑自己的现实，依靠他人的认可、接纳和爱来获取自我价值。
6.  **害怕冲突但被混乱吸引：** 避免对抗，却无意识地被有毒、高戏剧性的情境所吸引。
7.  **极度独立：** 从不寻求帮助，因为依赖他人感觉危险或软弱。
8.  **吸引毒性关系：** 重复不健康的模式，容忍虐待，因为功能失调的感觉“熟悉”。
9.  **要么过度信任要么完全不信任：** 要么盲目信任，要么假设所有人都有隐藏动机。
10. **对有需求感到内疚和羞耻：** 觉得设立界限或优先考虑自己是自私的。
11. **不识健康关系：** 觉得安全、稳定的爱和关系陌生，甚至无聊。
12. **对错误的人过度共情：** 深切同情那些伤害自己的人，却忽视自己的痛苦。
13. **害怕被抛弃：** 对被抛弃的深度焦虑，导致取悦他人、自我破坏或长期停留在不健康关系中。
14. **过度解读信息：** 像侦探一样过度分析文本、语音、邮件的标点和回复时间。
15. **过度解释：** 感觉需要为小决定辩解，试图说服他人或寻求认可。
16. **拒绝的巨大内疚感：** 觉得设定界限或说“不”是一种背叛。
17. **休息时感到懒惰：** 休息和放松会引发强烈的无聊、焦虑或羞耻感。
18. **在混乱中更安全：** 平静反而令人不安，感觉像有什么不对劲。
19. **难以接受赞美：** 赞美令人不适，可能引发怀疑，觉得是“拍马屁，后面有棍子”。
20. **情感变色龙：** 本能地根据周围的人调整个性、观点或情绪，成为“变形者”。
21. **难以感受真实自我：** 在社交场合感觉像是在表演，而不是做真实的自己。
22. **压力下的情感麻木：** 在压力下关闭情感，而非反应，甚至解离。
23. **强烈惊吓反射：** 因突然的噪音或意外互动而惊跳。
24. **成年后的冒名顶替感：** 担心被揭穿是骗子，觉得自己不配。
25. **害怕“太多”或“不够”：** 不断担心自己如何被感知，在“太多”和“不够”之间摇摆。

 If you grew up with a narcissistic parent, you've likely developed specific traits that still affect you today as an adult, many of which you might not even realize. Today, I'm going to break down the 25 common traits and make sure to write in the comments how many you relate to. I'm Jerry Wise, and for over 45 years, I've helped hundreds of thousands of people break free from narcissistic and dysfunctional family dynamics to reclaim their true self and finally build a life of emotional freedom, inner peace, and healthy relationships. So what are the specific traits adult children raised by narcissistic parents have? Now, these are some of the common ones. It's possible you could be an adult child of a narcissist and not have every one of these traits, but these are the common ones I have found after working with adult children of narcissists for many years. Number one, people pleasing. Believing love and acceptance must be earned by putting others first, even at their own expense. Number two, over awareness of others' emotions, constantly scanning for mood shifts, often at the expense of their own feelings. In addition to this, we might also be toxically empathetic, hyper empathetic towards other people in which we overly feel their feelings in an extreme way. Number three, overly apologetic for just existing, saying sorry excessively, even for things that aren't their fault. I remember even apologizing for the weather when I was doing church work many, many years ago. And I would say sorry for things that I have no control over whatsoever. Number four, struggling to make decisions, overthinking everything, terrified of making the wrong choice. And this happens so much with adult children of narcissists when they're trying to figure out what is their life purpose or what should they do for a job or what career should they choose? Or what is their direction? And there's so much fear about choosing wrongly. And I understand that fear. From my own personal experience, definitely understand that fear. Number five, low self-worth and chronic self-doubt, feeling never good enough, constantly questioning their own reality, and that low self-worth affects everything in our lives. And we're always doubting ourselves. And so we run on the gasoline of guilt, shame, fear, and a drive for acceptance, approval, and even to find love and to find our own self-worth from other people. And of course, self-worth doesn't come from other people. Self-esteem doesn't come from other people. Unless you are an infant, a toddler, then that's a whole different dynamic of what's going on. But once you hit a certain age, it can't come from someone else. I'm not saying others can't care about you or love you or support you, but no one can give you self-esteem because it's self-worth, self-esteem. Number six, fear of conflict, but attracted to chaos. So avoiding confrontation while unconsciously drawn to toxic, high drama situations. And isn't that kind of ironic that, again, I don't like conflict, but I'm drawn to the drama and chaos and toxicity of so many of my relationships. And why would that be? Because that is how we were programmed. The good news is we can break the program and reprogram ourselves. Number seven, hyper-independence. Never asking for help because relying on others feels dangerous or weak. And I would feel vulnerable if I have to rely on others. And so we can become hyper-independent. No one needs to help me. I need to always have enough money, always be able to do the right thing. I need to do it yourself, task. I need to, if I order a little piece of furniture or shelf, I need to be able to put together. If I need to move, I should do that myself. Hyper-independence can be one of the problems that we learned in a narcissistic home. Eight, attracting toxic relationships. Repeating unhealthy patterns and tolerating mistreatment because dysfunction feels similar. And again, it feels similar from our past. And of course, it's so crazy that we are drawn to something that feels like an old pair of jeans that fit so nice. And we can be drawn to that rather than beginning the process of self-differentiation where we change what we are drawn to because we change what's going on inside of us. One example would be if we're always looking for love from others and we don't love ourselves or we feel unlovable, continuing that looking is only going to be frustrating and probably will get us some pretty toxic relationships. We can begin to shift that by beginning and to work on our love for ourselves first. Which is why so many marriage therapists from my past working as a marriage therapist, you give advice to people who divorce, hey, why don't you not date for a year? Now, is that just because I don't think they would like to be in a relationship? No, they'd like to be in another relationship. They still need to grieve the loss of their marriage, but they need a year to begin to change their programming so that they don't end up with a second divorce. We need to change that programming because if you don't change that programming, second divorce, third divorce, fourth divorce, well, the first divorce occurred back when we were in children and then we divorce several times after that. Number nine, trusting too much or not at all. Either blindly trusting people or assuming everyone has hidden motives. That's the ACOM. That's the adult child of an narcissist. Many times, adult children of alcoholics experience that as well. Trusting too much or not at all. We are either clear over here on the pendulum or shift all the way over here to the pendulum because we never learn to be at the 90 degree mark. And that's what self differentiation is learning to do that rather than either extreme. Number 10, guilt and shame for having needs, feeling selfish for setting boundaries or to prioritize ourselves. If I would actually prioritize myself, no, I can't take you to the mall because I had plans to go to the library alone and spend some time looking through some new books that I wanted to look at and have that time be a restful, relaxing time for myself. And no, I don't need to take you to the mall right now. I can take you to the mall some other time. And that would be a prioritizing of myself. But that can feel very uncomfortable if you're an adult child of narcissist. Number 11, not knowing what healthy relationships feel like. Not knowing a safe relationship, stable love, a stable relationship. And true, healthy love feels foreign to us, even boring. I've had a lot of people who found someone that was really good for them. They were adult child of a narcissist. This occurred with ACOAs as well, adult children of alcoholics. They find a relationship and it is too boring for them. They are so used to the chaos, drama, crises, problems that you get into a relationship that might be healthy. And it just seems like there's nothing happening here. That's because of our programming. Number 12, intense empathy for the wrong people. Feeling deeply for those who hurt them while ignoring their own pain. Ever done that? Again, we feel sorry for people who have heard us and don't even care about ourselves or how we were impacted. And that is not selfishness. That is empathy wrongly directed is what that is. If you truly want to be empathetic, first be empathetic with you. Out of that, you'll know healthy empathy for others. Number 13, fear of abandonment. Deep anxiety about being left. Leading to people pleasing. Self-sabotage. Or staying in unhealthy relationships way too long. I can raise my hand. Lots of us have stayed in relationships way too long. We don't want to say goodbye. We don't want to say this needs to stop. We don't want to be left. And again, I'm worrying about the empathy and with my empathy about feelings of others. I don't want them to feel abandoned by me. When really, it may not be a healthy relationship to be in. So, we have this deep anxiety regarding fear of abandonment. Number 14, adult children of narcissists. Read too much into text messages. Voice messages. Letters. Emails. We may even analyze the punctuation and response times like a detective. Well, usually they respond back to me and, oh, within 15 minutes to a half hour, oh, it's been an hour. Oh my gosh, what does that mean? It means it's been an hour because you don't know why they haven't gotten back to you. And again, what does that punctuation mean? What do those words mean? We tend to overanalyze and read into things a lot of the times in relationships. And even with communications. Number 15, over explaining everything. Feeling the need to justify even small decision. And I have lots of folks who deal with their narcissistic parent or maybe other narcissistic family members. And they will continue to over explain after they become an adult, trying to either convince the other person that they're right. And these are the reasons why I'm doing this. And if you only know the reasons, you would be nice to me, accept me and understand my decision. As you probably already found out, that doesn't work very well. It just has you over explaining and putting you in, in many ways, a subordinate relationship to them. Why do I need to over explain? Well, mom and dad, we've always had Christmas. I'm an adult now. We've always had Christmas at your house on Christmas morning. The kids mom and I have decided we would like to have our own Christmas on Christmas morning and pick another day or another time when we can meet together as a family. And mom and dad or the parents get upset and go through drama, feel hurt. What, why are you doing this to us? Don't you know that's always our tradition. What's wrong with you? We want to see the grandchildren on Christmas day, not Christmas Eve or not the next day after Christmas. And for many of the kids, they might not even know what day it is. But it becomes very important for us as adults. And so by the way, Jesus was not born on Christmas day. So it's not December 25th. So you might want to remember that when we talk about that holiday. It wasn't on that day. But yet we put everything in it like it is. And actually, you know, it's a family time, which is fabulous. It's a religious holiday and a family time. And we then feel like we need to explain to them, well, it's because of this. And because the children, we want to spend more time with the children. We've always done it this way, mom and dad. And we need to, we want to make a change because we've just, you know, never have enough time for our kids in the morning. We have to get them all ready to go to grandma's house. It just makes Christmas day really problematic. I'm over explaining the decision. A good way to respond for an ACO in or an adult child is to say, I know this may come as a disappointment. We have always done this on Christmas morning. Sherry and I would like to do our family Christmas on Christmas day with our kids. And we'd like to arrange another time around the holiday where we bring them over and see you guys as grandparent and exchange gifts at that time. Again, I know it may feel like a disappointment, which I can understand because that has been our pattern. But we would like to change that. Do you know that nothing else needs to be explained? What else needs to be said? It's what you and Sherry decided, your adult, it's your family, it's your kids. Now they may say, well, how are we all going to get together with all the family? Because your brother and sister and their families will be here. I understand they probably will. And that's fine with us. We can spend some time with them at another time. Or we all may want to decide if we all want to be together that we may need to choose another day for us to get together. If not, you guys have that holiday. We'll have ours. And then we'll come over to your house at some other time. And then we'll get the gifts to my siblings and their kids. I mean, you know, I'm sorry it's a disruption, but this is what we've decided to do. So we want to watch the over-explaining. It only creates more reactivity when we over-explain. And certainly stay in a mode of firm calmness. That's very important for declaring self. Number 16, crippling guilt for saying no. The great book, When I Say No, I Feel Guilty by Manuel Smith is one of the best books I read early in my own recovery. And it just really, I think there's some other when I say no, I feel guilty books that have been out since then. We feel like setting boundaries or saying no is a betrayal in some ways. No, it's a preference. I'm not wishing to betray you. I'm not wishing to hurt you. It is my preference. You know, oh, well, here, here, you must eat the sweet potato pie. Well, I'm not one who really likes sweet potatoes all that much. Probably should because they're healthy, but I don't like the taste of them. And if somebody go and I go, no, I'm sure they're delicious. It's just not something I eat. And I can feel guilty for saying no rather than, okay, just spoon that on there. And then I just take a little teeny bit and then they go, well, you haven't finished those. You know, they're way up in my business. So I need to before that say, I appreciate very much. I'm sure they're delicious, but I want to pass on that right now. But thank you very much. 17, feeling lazy when resting, relaxing triggers, intense boredom, anxiety or shame. And again, can feel guilty, feel lazy, feel worthless if we're relaxing. That's a common one for many people that I've worked with. Number 18, feeling safer in chaos than in calm. Peace feels unsettling. Like something must be wrong. You know, everything's kind of calm and things are going on. Okay, I like it, but I'm still kind of hyper vigilant about something that's going to change or happen. Or when is the sort of Damocles going to fall? When is the other shoe going to drop? We have those kinds of feelings because growing up, there always was another shoe that dropped. If the shoe hadn't dropped yet, it will. And so we might feel safer in chaos than in calm. And one of the sayings I heard in the recovery community, if things are going along well, it may not be, you may not want to be standing around someone who's an ACO in or an ACOA. If things are in a crisis, there's a panic or some real problem. You're always safer next to an ACOA and an ACO in because they can manage themselves real well during that time. But when it's boring, calm and healthy, that may confuse them and cause them much more anxiety. Number 19, struggling to accept praise. Compliments makes ACO ends feel uncomfortable and may breed suspicion. Well, I wonder why they're complimenting me. What, how am I going to get smacked in the end? This feels like a pat on the head, but I'll bet a smack is coming. And that's common for those of us who grew up in a dysfunctional family. Number 20, emotional chameleon. We become an emotional chameleon. Instinctively adapting personality, opinions or emotions depending on who we're around. We are a shapeshifter. If that's where I know that's in the movie somewhere, I saw that. But we are chameleon. Maybe that's the bet. We just kind of turn into the colors and experience of what's around us. Now, there's nothing wrong with getting along with people in different settings, but I don't consider that being a chameleon. A chameleon is I'm whatever this group system is. I'm going to absorb it and regurgitate it. That's a chameleon. Number 21, struggling to feel real. Feeling like they are just performing in social situations instead of just being themselves. Have you ever realized that when you go out or go to a party and you're all done? You may have even had a good time, but if somebody were to say, were you your real self at the party? Well, no, not really. I mean, I laughed. I did this. But could I just sit there quietly if I wanted? Could I tell a joke if I wanted? Could I express an opinion if I wanted? Or maybe even express an opinion that wouldn't be popular. Not that I want to bring every party down because of a negative opinion, but I'm just saying that, you know, how real are we when we're in social situations? Twenty two, emotional numbness in stressful moments, often ACO ends shut down instead of reacting. They may be reactive. They may shut down. And then of course, the ultimate shut down is kind of dissociation, where we just kind of leave the reality here for a moment and leave our bodies and leave our awareness. And so emotional numbness is not uncommon. Twenty three, an intense startle reflex, jumping at sudden noises or unexpected interaction. And I know after I experienced a post-traumatic stress situation that was pretty traumatic, I noticed how much I was had an intense startle reflex. And even today, if I hear a particular loud sound or at a particular time of day, that may cause me to jump or to it doesn't interfere with my life in any major way. But, you know, that can be a carryover from PTSD or growing up in a narcissist's home with CPTSD 24, feeling like an imposter in adulthood, waiting for someone to expose them as a fraud. We just don't feel like we are who we are. And I just don't want anyone to know who I really am. Because if you all knew who I really was, well, you wouldn't be listening to me at all. It's that imposter syndrome that regardless of the problems and things I've been through, you can listen to me, learn from me, take what you can use and leave the rest. That's how we should view YouTube videos. But many of us have experienced the imposter syndrome because of growing up in dysfunctional families. Number 25, fear of being too much or not enough, constantly worrying how we are being perceived. And again, in relationships and dating situations, am I too much? Am I not enough? And we do the, what I call, the pendulum swing. And the pendulum emotional swing and mental swing is often a result of a toxic, narcissistic, or very dysfunctional family. We go from this side to zero degrees over to 180 degrees. And as I've learned, 180 degrees from sick is still sick. 90 degrees is what's healthy. And so we get to a balance and learn to love ourselves and care about ourselves. So I don't feel like I'm too much. I don't feel like I'm not enough. I'm just kind of me.
