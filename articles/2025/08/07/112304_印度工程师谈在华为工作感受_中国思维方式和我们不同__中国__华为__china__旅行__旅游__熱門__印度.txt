**核心思想总结**

本文深入探讨了作者在华为任职期间所观察到的中国独特工作文化、领导力特质以及日常生活，并将其与印度文化进行对比，最终归结为个人职业生涯和创业心态的深刻转变。

**总结纲要：**

1.  **华为经历概览**
    *   三年华为任期，获得大量曝光。
    *   曾在中国、巴西各驻扎一年，并在印尼工作6-9个月。

2.  **中国工作文化深度解析**
    *   **极致奋斗精神：** 超长工时，极度专注，拥有“战时心态”。
    *   **卓越执行力：**
        *   注重精度和制造（世界制造中心）。
        *   员工高度敬业、专注工作，不分心、不闲聊。
        *   对流程高度信任，不轻易质疑或过度思考（与印度文化形成对比）。
    *   **领导力特质：**
        *   “战时心态”：不惧挑战市场巨头，具备弱者思维。
        *   坚决果断，没有退路/B计划的思维（如伊隆·马斯克的“非死即生”）。
    *   **日常工作生活：**
        *   高度专注，单一目标导向。
        *   员工普遍对工作满意，不抱怨。
        *   注重家庭（如家庭聚餐，吃火锅）。
        *   重视健康饮食和茶文化。

3.  **中国与印度文化对比**
    *   **工作态度：** 中国人信任流程，重执行；印度人倾向于过度思考和质疑。
    *   **对失败的看法：** 中国人不太担心失败或结果，更关注是否全力以赴；印度人因害怕失败的耻辱和社交压力而过度担忧。
    *   **规划：** 印度人常有备用计划（Plan B/C），易于放弃；中国人目标明确，坚决到底。
    *   **执行力：** 中国人以“维拉特·科利”般的精神（全力以赴）超越竞争对手。

4.  **个人学习与职业影响**
    *   中国经历对作者的职业生涯产生了100%的积极影响，核心是“心态”的转变。
    *   习得“战时心态”和“全力以赴”（All-in）的精神。
    *   这种心态的转变直接促成了其第三次创业（Momo项目）的成功，认识到只有“背水一战”才能真正学习和成长。

**核心结论：**
中国文化中极致的奋斗精神、卓越的执行力和对目标毫不妥协的战时心态，是其能够迅速崛起的关键，也为个人带来了深刻的“全力以赴”的成长启示。

**Overarching Framework (总体框架):**
文化对比分析：通过个人亲身经历，对比中印两国在工作文化、领导力、日常心态上的差异，并强调中国模式对个人职业发展和“破釜沉舟”式创业精神的深刻塑造。

I joined this company called Huawei. Uh yeah. And and Huawei gave me a lot of exposure. I was there with Huawei for 3 years. >> You went to China. >> Yeah. >> Stayed in China. >> Yeah. I was in China for an year and I was in Brazil for an year with Huawei in Indonesia. Indonesia. I had visited traveled for work in my previous stint but I was in Indonesia for almost 6 to9 months. In your phase in China, you realized how much importance is given to work, longer work hours, extreme hustle mentality. The Chinese go to war for the sake of their work. >> Yeah. >> Uh downside is possibly mental health issues. Uh kind of boxed thinking which you see with which you see often with Chinese people all over the world. >> Yeah. >> Is anything you'd like to add about China? No, I think I think those that summarizes that pretty well in terms of what is required to be done and then also I think u the mentality that China at that time when I joined Huawei China wasn't what it is today like China is almost practically a superpower today right uh after US it wasn't the same today so they had to they were very clear in their mindset that they have to work hard to get to what they need to get to that's what I liked about the the country and the folks in there. Like it was very very mission and purpose-driven. They knew that they're not born with a silver spoon. They'll have to work hard to get to where they need to get to. And that was my learning, right? War time mentality. I learned that from there. But also, I think this mindset that like we'll have to work extra hard to get to where we need to cuz otherwise other countries will take over. >> So that that call it fire, call call it Virat Kohli mentality. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean you have to work extra to get to where you need to. You can't be comfortable saying oh we are just take it for granted saying oh anyways we're going to be the manufacturing hub of the world so we don't need to do anything and we'll just make it. I think this is what Indians need to understand about the Chinese that it's a country full of different caliber with art kohies in terms of mentality. That's what they're boxed into. At least this is what I've heard generally. >> Yeah I've seen less of creative side there more of execution side there. They're very good at execution. They will out execute you. Like if you're competing with the Chinese, you can count on the fact that they will out execute you. >> What is out execute? >> Meaning just put in more hours. >> More hours. Do it better than you like the actual execution, right? Do it better than you in terms of execution. Uh like for example, manufacturing this that's why it's called a manufacturing hub or or the capital of the world, right? cuz there is focus on precision and making sure like even Apple manufacturers in China let's go one day deep why are they able to execute better one is the number of hours second is sincerity and dedication like they dedicate to the art of whatever they're doing so for example I even gone into Huawei's manufacturing Huawei had a lot of phone manufacturing chip manufacturing router manufacturing all physical equip equipment manufacturing right so I've gone inside and checked Check that out. And what you see there is like the people are not wondering when is my lunch break, right? When is my tea break, when is my next break, what have you, right? There's no time for gossip, chitchat, nothing. When they're working, they're just working, right? And that to me is like fascinating. So they're not even bothered about who's coming watching us. Like we would go as visitors, you know, walking around the manufacturing setup. Nobody cares. You're doing your job, I'm doing mine. They're focused on their thing and they do it like like a religion. >> Okay, maybe the answer that I was looking for is what's in the education system that's making them this way because everyone goes through the education system. I think the whole country is literate. >> I would not say a lot of these folks are like you know engineer educated sort of levels 12 standard. >> Yeah. Yeah. Most most folks are but tier 2, tier three maybe not. >> Oh really? >> Yeah. Yeah. There are a lot of poor places in China also. >> But then okay at least tier one which is possibly driving the growth of the country. >> Sure. >> What's going so correct in the education system that we don't have because even we have tier one populations here which are pretty capable but there's something that we're up compared to them. >> That's a that's a good question. And I mean I' I've not thought about it from that perspective but I think one of the things is in India I think especially India I mean I can compare it with India and I maybe we'll come back to US and and talk about US a bit as well. I think in India we have this tendency and and this can be controversial. >> Yeah. We have this tendency to sort of over think and over question everything right like we don't trust the process in China that's not the case they trust the process that's what I've seen I think that's the major difference between Indian uh culture and and and Chinese culture they believe in doing >> yeah let's do it and let's not keep questioning everything let's not keep secondg guessing am I am I going to get this output let me do my part the most let me not worry about the result and the outcome >> okay one layer deep maybe it's because in India we fear shame as an emotion >> shame or failure I mean shame as an outcome of failure that's what I was sure >> going for like isn't >> it basically boils down to gossip culture in India that what do people say with and it is a thing >> social pressure from failures I think that's how I would you know I mean even I had that when I was doing my momo thing I wasn't too sure if I should tell everybody cuz I'm doing a momo after being an engineer and I was a computer science grad. So with that background I also had that during that time. >> So probably this overthinking which is the problem for India is an outcome of the fear of shame. >> Possib possibly like I I felt that during my times when I was doing my mom thing I would not go and tell everybody at that point >> and maybe in China failure is not looked down upon as much. they don't worry about the outcome so much. So even if there is failure or success, they don't worry about the outcome. Have I put in my 100% to the best of my abilities? That's the focus. That is a clear cultural difference. In terms of macro strategy like the leaders at the top, I am assuming they would be cut from the same cloth. >> Yeah. >> But is anything difference in Chinese leaders versus Indian leaders? I I I think the wartime mentality is for sure like they do they're not worried about taking on the the big shots in the market like if you're not a market leader they're not worried about taking on something somebody larger right so that underdog mindset is a very different mindset as from leadership perspective you got to be aware that you are an underdog which means you don't have all the luxuries of what a larger competitor has they may have more employees they may have more money they have a bigger brand, they have more customers. In spite of not having all of that, how do you go compete with them and be prepared to get your backside kicked? Right? So that I've seen for sure in leadership there. I'm not saying we don't that have we don't have that in India. There are good leaders who are doing that in India now, especially the new set of folks. But I think it's a more like there's a larger set of leaders I've seen uh in China who come with that mindset. They're not too worried about like what if I am not able to get to my outcome. Like I think I think uh Elon says it very well, right? I think uh Joe Rogan or or Lex Freriedman was asking this question in one of his podcasts like what's your plan B or plan C if plan A doesn't work? And he says I don't think like that right like for me like once I decide something needs to be done it needs to be done right till death I think that's the mindset there in China >> versus what do you see in Bangalore or Mumbai or Kura >> I think too many people have plan B's and plan C's too many plan B's and plan C's and then always second guessing our outcome oh like time boxing it and we also taught from this culturally from childhood cut your losses, have a timeline, right? Move on. And in a lot of cases, that's not a bad thing. But I also feel like from my own experiences in life, would I have done better if I was always not second guessing myself? I absolutely think so. >> What's life like in China? Just daily life. It's a lot of work obviously. Long work hours. >> Yeah. Yeah. Like long work hours. life. I I I mean I'm I'm a tea uh you know connoisseur. So I love the China culture in terms of tea and health and uh there's a lot of natural stuff, natural eating. They don't overcook food. So from that perspective, yes. And then from work perspective, very focused. come in, do your put in your hours. Uh if get your work done and then go home and and I mean enjoy or not enjoy is questionable. >> Yeah, this is what I want to know because I feel like career growth is an outcome of what you do in your free time as well. So what do Chinese people do in their free time? I don't think people have a lot of second careers or other things they think at least when I was there I did not see that maybe times have changed now with all the influencer culture and a lot of other alternative live streams or or money streams coming in maybe that's changed now but when I was there it was single threaded right like people would just have one single thread focus and just do that and they were happy with that I people were not complaining like my colleagues I was not like a CEO of of Huawei right so I was at a middle management below that level. So there you know the reality the ground check was people were happy doing what they were doing. Nobody complained, nobody cribbed people happy doing what they did. They vibe with Indians. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean they Yeah. I mean you also end up learning a little bit of Mandarin, right? I learned to count from 1 to 100 cuz then you can negotiate to buy stuff, right? So yeah, uh I learned a little bit of Mandarin there. But yeah, very cool. >> What conversations do you have with a regular Chinese person? >> It's just exchanging. I mean, I think there's a solid bond between Indian and Chinese culture. Like there's uh that strength of bond with family. So that's a common thread. They do a lot of family dinners uh dinners usually, right? Hot pot, Chinese hot pot. They would have a pot of stuff to eat and they would the whole family would get together. Sundays are usually that. >> Aren't you vegetarian? >> Yeah, I am. >> So, how did you manage being >> vegetarian hot pots are also there? >> You get vegetarian food there. >> Yeah. Yeah. Uh, okay. So, you have to be a little careful in terms of what they call vegetarian. >> For them, a lot of things are also like non-vegetarian is also vegetarian. >> But once you've stayed there enough, you know exactly what to ask for. >> Did that whole phase add value to your career? >> 100%. like biggest value is mentality >> mentality mindset and then I think so what I okay I'll go back to my third venture the momo piece right so my first two ventures now that I reflect back the first two ventures I was not fully in meaning I always had if those didn't work out I could always go do something else with my first startup I could go get my engineering degree which I did my second startup I just did it before my first job so if that didn't work out I could go get my first job So what I realized with my momo thing was I was all in. I quit my job in the states came back and then did my venture. I was all in. So it's almost like when you're learning to ride a bike, you have your those two tires or whatever it's on the side. You know you will not fall. You really don't learn to bike then, right? Like you really learn to bike when you take those off. That's what happened here. Heat. Heat. N. [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat.
