Description:
美印贸易冲突升级，印度采取战略多元化以维护国家利益。

### 核心观点

尽管美国施加关税压力并威胁，印度仍坚定奉行其独立外交政策，通过加强与俄罗斯和中国的关系来捍卫国家利益并实现战略多元化。

### 核心框架

地缘政治背景下的贸易战、能源安全与国家主权自主。

### 总结大纲

**一、美国对印度加征关税**
1.  **关税详情：** 特朗普政府将对印度商品的关税从25%提升至50%。
2.  **关税原因：** 印度购买俄罗斯石油。
3.  **生效时间与豁免：**
    *   新关税将于9月生效。
    *   在途商品、美国国家安全所需品（如半导体、相关电子产品）、农产品、钢铁和铝等因美国需求而被豁免。
4.  **影响与性质：**
    *   美国是印度最大的出口市场（去年双边贸易额超1300亿美元）。
    *   此次50%的进口税被视为“惩罚”，其驱动力是政治而非贸易。
    *   订单还针对间接进口，即通过第三国转运的商品也无法规避关税。

**二、印度坚守立场并反驳**
1.  **外交部声明：** 印度外交部发表声明，认为美国近来针对印度从俄罗斯进口石油的行为“极度不幸”。
2.  **印度立场：**
    *   强调印度石油进口是基于市场因素，旨在确保14亿人口的能源安全。
    *   谴责美国行为“不公平、不合理、不公正”，并指出其他国家也采取类似行动。
3.  **双重标准指控：** 印度此前曾指责美国和欧盟采取双重标准，因为欧盟仍在进口俄罗斯能源，美国也从俄罗斯进口铀和化肥。
4.  **特朗普的回应：** 特朗普被问及美国进口俄罗斯铀和化肥时称“不知情”，被批评为“逃避问题，散布谎言”。
5.  **印度决心：** 印度声明将采取一切必要行动保护其国家利益。

**三、印度的战略选择：多元化**
1.  **面临选项：**
    *   **选项一：** 与白宫谈判，但特朗普的反复无常和印度不愿损害自身利益使其可行性不高。
    *   **选项二（印度正在采纳）：** 战略多元化，即利用广泛的伙伴关系网络，建立长期替代方案，减少对美国等“不可靠市场”的依赖。
2.  **多元化挑战：** 过程不易且耗时，但符合印度长远利益。

**四、加强与俄罗斯的关系**
1.  **深化合作：** 尽管面临关税和威胁，印度仍在加强与俄罗斯的联系。
2.  **高层互访：**
    *   **国家安全顾问阿吉特·多瓦尔访问莫斯科：** 讨论了俄罗斯石油、国防供应以及S-400防空系统（印度已订购5套，3套已交付，剩余2套可能加速交付）。S-400系统对印度国防至关重要。
    *   **外交部长S·杰尚卡尔将访俄：** 共同主持重要会议，讨论能源供应、技术转让和战略基础设施。
    *   **普京总统有望访印：** 多瓦尔和杰尚卡尔的访问将为普京的访问奠定基础。

**五、开启对华新阵线**
1.  **总理莫迪将赴华：** 本月晚些时候，莫迪总理将前往中国出席上海合作组织（SCO）峰会。
2.  **传递信号：** 此次访问预计将传递出信号，尽管不直接针对特朗普的贸易战，但将影响对话内容。

**六、结论**
印度正在坚决主张其选择权，无视美国的压力和特朗普的要求。

 He has done it again. Donald Trump has targeted India yet again. Just 24 hours ago he had threatened new tariffs on India and now he has delivered. The 25 percent duty has been doubled. So tariffs on Indian goods will now stand at 50 percent. Trump has escalated his trade offensive and this time India is squarely in his crosshairs. Earlier today the US president signed an executive order. He says it says the same thing as a statement in social media posts that India buys Russian oil that is why it will face higher tariffs. That's essentially what Trump's executive order says. Now these tariffs will take effect in September. And what happens to goods which are already in transit? They will be exempted. Let me put this in context. Does this new tariff apply to all Indian exports? The answer is no. There are some exemptions like goods required for US national security, semiconductors and related electronics. Exports like farmer, steel and aluminium, they've all been exempted from the higher tariff because the US needs them. But beyond these goods most Indian exports will be impacted. And remember the US is India's largest export market bilateral trade last year crossed 130 billion dollars. So this 50 percent import tax is not just a tariff, it's a penalty and it's driven by politics not trade. In fact the order goes further. It also targets indirect imports. So if goods are routed through a third country they will still face tariffs. There is no workaround. Actually Donald Trump is turning up the heat. He's punishing India for buying Russian oil. And so far New Delhi has stood its ground. A short while back India issued a statement. It came from the Ministry of External Affairs. I have a copy of the statement. This is what it says. The United States has in recent days targeted India's oil imports from Russia. We have already made clear our position on these issues including the fact that our imports are based on market factors and done with the overall objective of ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people of India. It is therefore extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest. We reiterate that these actions are unfair, unjustified and unreasonable. India will take all actions necessary to protect its national interest. This is what the Indian statement has said. In an earlier statement India had accused the United States and European Union of double standards. Remember the EU continues to import energy from Russia. And despite Donald Trump's tough talk America still buys uranium and fertilizers from Russia. Yesterday Trump was confronted with this fact. Listen to how he responded. India says that the US imports Russian uranium chemicals fertilizers while criticising their energy imports your response to that sir. I don't know anything about it. I'd have to check but we'll get back to you on that. Yeah, please. Well that's Trump being Trump dodging the tough questions and peddling falsehoods. The question at this moment is what does India do next? There are two options. Option one. India could negotiate with the White House and we know how Trump operates. He could announce a deal today, tear it up tomorrow, then return with a new set of demands. Plus India would not want a deal that hurts its interests. And those issues, those sticking points have not changed. The other option is strategic diversification. Leverage India's broad network of partnerships, build long-term alternatives and reduce dependence on unreliable markets like the United States of America. It won't be easy. It won't be quick. But it would be in the interest of India. And this is the path New Delhi seems to be taking. Which brings me to Russia. Despite the tariffs and the threats, India is doubling down on its ties with Russia. National Security Advisor Ajit Doval landed in Moscow today. This visit was planned months ago. But now it assumes greater importance. Doval met with senior Russian officials. He discussed a wide range of agenda items from Russian oil to Russian defense supplies. He also discussed the S-400 defense system. The one that India is buying from Russia, India signed a $5.4 billion contract for the S-400 in the year 2018. Five squadrons were ordered. Three have been delivered and deployed. Two systems are yet to be delivered. They could be fast-tracked after today's engagements. Now this system, the S-400, has already proven crucial to India's defenses. In May this year, during operations in the U.S. 400, reinforced India's aerial defenses against Pakistani missiles and drones. Some reports suggest that India could seek more S-400 units from Russia. So clearly Trump's tariffs have had no impact on this relationship. Later this month, external affairs minister S-Jeshankar will travel to Russia. He will co-chair an important meeting. The conversation will likely address energy supplies, tech transfers and strategic infrastructure. President Putin is expected to visit India as well. This could happen in the coming months. So Doval's visit, followed by Jeshankar's trip, could lay the groundwork for Putin's visit to India. And that's not all. India is opening a second front as well with China. New Delhi made a major announcement today. Prime Minister Modi will travel to China later this month. He will attend the SEO Summit. SEO stands for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. It's a grouping of Eurasian countries. Expect them to send some signals. They may not address Trump's trade war directly, but it will shape their conversations. So join the docs. Now let's visit Russia. Jeshankar's upcoming engagements in Moscow and then Prime Minister Modi's visit to China. The message is consistent. India is asserting its right to choose despite American pressure and in defiance of Trump's demands.
