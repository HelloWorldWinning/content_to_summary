**摘要要求1：总结的大纲和结构**

*   **引言：辨识与治愈的必要性**
    *   母亲本应支持和滋养，但若她成为你的对立面，会让你陷入困惑和内疚。
    *   本期旨在揭示自恋型母亲的10个迹象，帮助你理解并摆脱这种复杂关系。
    *   重点强调：认识真相并非为了指责，而是为了治愈，以便准确评估现状，并在人际交往中荣耀神。

*   **自恋型母亲的10个典型迹象**
    *   **1. 视你为她的延伸：** 剥夺你的独立身份和选择权，通过你实现她的愿望，认为你是她的“映射”，必须依从她的偏好。
    *   **2. 极度批判：** 对他人和万事万物习惯性地挑剔，以此确立自身优越感；但自身若受到丝毫批评，则会立即产生激烈反弹。
    *   **3. 有毒性反应：** 长期表现出防御、冷处理、受害者姿态；从不承认错误，任何对其幻觉的挑战都会引发“放射性”反应。
    *   **4. 缺乏同理心：** 表面上会伪装同情，但实际上并不关心你的痛苦，尤其当你的困境对她不便或涉及她自身时。
    *   **5. 不尊重你的界限：** 将你的“不”视为对她的个人冒犯，坚信自己对你的生活有绝对控制权，并常以“我是你妈”或“你怎能这样对你妈妈”等言论进行情感勒索。
    *   **6. 戴着面具：** 在公众场合维持一个“甜美”、“善良”的完美形象，但在私下里，面具会滑落或完全卸下，私下与公开形象截然不同。
    *   **7. 认为他人嫉妒她：** 无法与人建立真诚持久的关系；当朋友离开时，她会将原因归咎于对方嫉妒自己。
    *   **8. 有特权感和自视甚高：** 无论是外显的浮夸行为（如在派对上不恰当地跳舞、吹嘘），还是内隐的优越感，都显示出她认为自己高人一等。
    *   **9. 歪曲现实（煤气灯效应）：** 否认说过或做过的事，称你“太敏感”，不追求真诚的联结，只渴望被崇拜；会迅速颠倒是非，让你怀疑自己的记忆。
    *   **10. 奇怪的面部表情：** 常常表现出难以控制的面部表情，如翻白眼、嘲讽的坏笑、眼睑颤动，这些都透露出她对他人（包括你）的轻蔑和不屑。

 Moms are supposed to be supportive and nurturing, but what happens when the very woman that should be your number one fan is actually your number one adversary? And if you're like most people, you just slip into this confusing guilt-ridden mess. And that's why in today's episode, you're going to learn the 10 signs that your mother is a narcissist. And these are the signs that every single one of my students has experienced, but just couldn't make sense of. But I want you to please note that Christianity isn't about just slapping a love label on someone and ignoring all the damage that they caused. And nor is our time together meant to be a mom bashing episode, but rather, I want you to allow God to bring to light what the enemy is trying to keep in darkness. So in doing so, you can now have an accurate assessment of your situation and honor God in your interactions. So let's dive into the 10 signs and I'm really curious to hear what you think about number 10. Number one, she sees you as an extension of her. Imagine how someone would feel if they weren't allowed to have their own identity, weren't able to make their own choices without upsetting someone. In my world, that leads to a codependent performance-driven mess. Narcissistic mothers often lived their life through their children. Maybe mom always wanted to be the popular one, so she pushed you to always look pretty. Or she didn't finish college, so now you had to go on to some prestigious schools so she can have bragging rights. And most of us moms like to be proud of our children's choices, but narcissistic moms take this to a toxic level. You're a reflection of her, so therefore, you must make choices based upon her preferences. Number two, she's critical. Look, not all critical people are narcissists, but all narcissists are critical. And she likely has something to say about everyone and everything, and in doing so, positions herself as superior. And this can be through overtly criticizing someone or you for their choices or passive aggressively, making comments about someone else in an attempt to make sure to get the message to you. But ironically, if you have any criticism or complaint about her, you will get met with a toxic reaction as you are now creating a crack in her fragile facade. And number three, she has toxic reactions. Look, we can all overreact or react poorly from time to time, but narcissistic mothers will maintain this radioactivity as her MO. And you can likely predict that she will have a defensive stone walling victim-like reaction if you attempt to bring anything to her attention that she doesn't want to hear. And narcissistic mothers can not and will not look at themselves. So if you challenge her delusion, the response will be radioactive. Nothing is ever her fault. And if you ever try to argue otherwise, you will get met with the victim and martyr. Number four, she lacks empathy. Narcissistic mothers will fake empathy with their sweet, high-pitched voices and their feigned sincerity. It's all an act. When push comes to shove, she can't fake it anymore. She doesn't care about what you're going through, especially if it inconveniences her or worse, pertains to her. And some of these moms have realized just how selfish they appear. So they will make excuses like, oh, have something so much more devastating to deal with and thereby making you the problem because you don't now have empathy for what she's going through. If you've struggled under the weight of a toxic mother and want to break free to all that God has for you, I want to encourage you to check out my online course called the Toxic Mother Survival Course. Or we also have another course called How to Heal from a Toxic Mother, Restoring Your Life Through Faith. I will go ahead and include links in the description section below. And number five, she doesn't respect your boundaries. Narcissistic mothers do not take no for an answer. Your boundaries are perceived as a personal slight towards her because after all, I'm your mother. Whether she's sharing your personal information to others or overriding your preferences, she believes that you should cower to her commands. And since narcissistic mothers still view their adult children as young children, they believe wholeheartedly that they have free reign over your life and you owe them. And here's where you're going to get met with a manipulative comment like, you're supposed to honor and obey me, or what kind of Christian treats their mother this way. All of this is in an attempt to disregard your limits and shame you into feeling like a bad person. Number six, she wears a mask. Narcissistic mothers have several facades that they try to uphold, and this can be done easily for a short period in public, but get behind closed doors in private, and you're going to see that mask slip or fall off completely. Their public persona is in stark contrast to their private one. And this is why it makes your skin cool when you hear people say, your mother's so great. Oh, she's so sweet. And you think, huh, if you only knew. And number seven, she believes that others are jealous of her. Mom having trouble keeping friends long term. No, I'm not talking about those equally toxic girls that she's been friends with since college. I'm talking about a constant revolving door of people in and out of her life. Narcissists can't have genuine connection with others. So when those people end up leaving, which they always do, the narrative that sounds best in her mind is, oh, she was just jealous of me. That leads to number eight. She's entitled and self important. And this trait can be overt or covert. The overt will be a bit more histrionic in her behavior, making overt displays to get attention. Maybe that's dancing inappropriately at a party or bragging to anyone with an ear or treating people that she deems inferior, like trash. The covert narcissist may not be as obnoxious in her expressions, but make no mistake. She will exude superiority over others, especially watch for number 10. But first, in number nine, she distorts reality, otherwise known as gaslighting. You can't have a healthy conversation with a narcissistic mother because she is always telling you that you're remembering things wrong. Whether she denies saying or doing something or just calls you too sensitive when you try to raise an issue, narcissistic mothers don't desire genuine connection. I know they say they do they desire admiration. And if you're questioning her challenges that she will flip the script on you faster than a fry cook flips hotcakes. And number 10, she has weird facial expressions. Okay, so this one isn't so much proven. But in my experience, I've seen most narcissistic mothers with these almost uncontrollable facial expressions that reveal their contempt for others, from eye rolls, to snarky smirks, to eye flutters. I can't even do it if I tried it. These are all signs of disdain and disapproval towards others. They truly think that they're better than others, including you. Okay, so dare I ask how many signs have you seen so far? Let me know in the comments below. And did you know that growing up with a narcissistic mother can actually lead to people pleasing? Or you're always saying yes, and I'm sorry. And if you want to know just how much this has impacted your life, I want to invite you to go ahead and take our free What type of people pleaser am I quiz? And if you're ready to learn the three signs that God is telling you it's time to give up on someone, go ahead and check out this episode next.
