 Have you noticed that the reputation of porn has changed a lot over the years? Looking at porn magazines used to be an embarrassing secret, but when porn became a big part of the internet, people started to realize that everyone watches porn. The conversation around it changed and became a private but accepted thing. Now the conversation is changing once again. Now that we've been able to be open about the reality of porn, we can evaluate it with more honesty. We now know that porn can be unhealthy. But masturbation is still a fact of life so naturally the issue arises. What happens when we try to separate them? Masturbation and porn are often so closely linked that many people don't consider one without the other. Today we're exploring what happens when you masturbate without using porn. How does it impact your mental health? Positively or negatively? Our goal is to raise awareness and encourage more open discussions about these taboo topics that aren't talked about enough, especially when it comes to their connection to mental wellness. Relationship with sexuality Masturbating without porn can change your relationship with sexuality. Porn can make you want more porn like sex. This means engaging in things that may look more visually appealing but without being as functional or satisfying. Porn like sex could also mean more aggressive sex that could be dangerous or inconsiderate towards your partner. Watching porn while masturbating can also mess with your expectations in other ways. Women start to expect women to act and look more like they do in pornography, which has been linked to relationship to satisfaction. The overstimulation of your senses also makes sex itself less enjoyable or satisfying. Have you ever had to picture someone or something else in your mind to really enjoy sex? That might be because of porn. But not everyone is having sex so you might think porn won't be that bad as the single person. Porn can still affect your relationships in negative ways. If you have any friends of the gender you're attracted to, you might find yourself sexualizing them more often. Porn conditions us to look for things that appeal to the sexual side of our brain and reduce our desire for partnered sex over a masturbation. So ultimately porn makes you want sexual intimacy less but look for sexual things more. Punishment without porn can reduce the harm of pornography addiction, hypersexuality, and sexual cravings while still addressing the health benefits associated with masturbation. If you stop masturbating with porn, the world may start to feel like a different place and your relationships will feel more fulfilling. Mental health. Porn can affect your mental health negatively. It's usually the last thing we consider when dealing with depression, anxiety, and fatigue but porn can be responsible. Of course not every person that watches porn has related mental health issues but the mental health problems that come from porn are prevalent enough to be mentioned. The chances of pornography habits leading to issues like depression increase. The more problematic your porn use becomes. Like use is when you struggle to control the frequency, duration, or intensity of your porn habit or when it starts to disrupt relationships or your well-being. Men and women struggling with problematic porn use reported worsened loneliness, stress, anxiety, depression, and life satisfaction according to this recent study. So choosing not to use porn when you masturbate can help your mind relax. Men has an addictive nature which comes with various risks to your mental health. Breaking away from porn might help you feel less restless, anxious, and depressed. This way the benefits of masturbation don't come with mental health baggage. Improved health. It isn't just your mental health that you have to consider. Your physical health and sexual functioning can also improve when porn is taken out of the equation. An over-reliance on porn has been found to lead to issues such as erectile dysfunction. Without porn, you can slowly build up that healthy sexual function. Porn kills your motivation to seek out a partner, so for some people cutting out porn could give them the motivation for self-improvement and good physical health and hygiene. Porn has tricked people into thinking that it's the only way to make masturbating fun or exciting. Washing without porn doesn't have to be a cold, clinical thing that you only do for the base function. Masturbation is just as fun without the visual stimulation. Over time, you might even start to enjoy more when porn isn't involved. Without those dependencies, cravings, and other downsides of porn, you can focus more on how it feels, rather than the quality of what you're looking at. Your mind, body, and your relationships will all benefit from making this change.
