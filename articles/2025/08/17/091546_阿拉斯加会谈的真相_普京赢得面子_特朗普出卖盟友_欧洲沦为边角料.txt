Description:
**一、阿拉斯加会晤：一场没有即时结果的深层博弈**

1.  **会晤背景与表象**
    *   **焦点事件：** 特朗普与普京在阿拉斯加的首次美国本土直接对话，全球瞩目。
    *   **现场气氛：** 高规格安保，媒体高度关注，双方核心幕僚参与。
    *   **会谈结果：** 历时三小时，未达成停火声明、具体协议，甚至取消记者问答环节。
    *   **双方表态：** 特朗普“没有协议直到有协议”，普京“富有成果但需更多时间”，看似礼貌实则虚无，市场期待落空。

2.  **核心缺席方：欧洲与乌克兰的边缘化**
    *   **讽刺之处：** 围绕乌克兰问题的核心对话，乌克兰与欧洲主要盟友均被排除在外。
    *   **特朗普动机：** 对北约和欧盟长期不满，指责欧洲“搭便车”，强调美国为欧洲安全付出过多，寻求通过“保护费”换取利益。
    *   **普京动机与战略胜利：** 旨在瓦解西方团结，边缘化欧洲进而边缘化乌克兰，以在谈判中获取更大筹码。
    *   **历史回音：** 类似冷战时期美苏峰会决定欧洲命运，如今欧洲再次失去议价权，被动接受大国博弈结果。
    *   **欧洲代价：** 能源成本飙升，战略自主受限，对美依赖加深，可能导致资本外流，经济复苏承压，陷入政治和经济的双重焦虑。

3.  **普京的战略回归与“存在感”的胜利**
    *   **核心收获：** 最大的成果是“存在感”，成功打破西方“孤立俄罗斯”的叙事，证明俄罗斯在全球议题中不可或缺。
    *   **国内影响：** 提升普京在国内的支持率，向民众传递“俄罗斯未被遗忘、仍是世界核心玩家”的心理慰藉。
    *   **国际效应：** 巧妙将自己包装成“不可或缺的对话者”，削弱西方“民主国家团结”的号召力，向非西方伙伴展示与俄罗斯合作的回旋空间。
    *   **深层意义：** 无论是否有实质协议，普京都可借此宣称“俄罗斯赢了”，因为象征意义和舆论力量在当前世界中举足轻重。

4.  **特朗普的功利算盘与市场的长期展望**
    *   **“交易型总统”本色：** 不关心意识形态，一切以利益最大化为导向，通过“制造危机”和“解决危机”为自己赢得政治资本和经济回报。
    *   **会谈目标：** 并非旨在解决乌克兰问题本身，而是利用会谈换取对美国有利的筹码，如能源供应配合、中东博弈默契、欧洲增加军费等。
    *   **市场解读：** 资本市场初期平静，但老玩家深知大国会晤会改变长期格局，资金已在暗中调整仓位，呈现避险与防御性资产流入趋势。
    *   **长期影响：**
        *   **能源安全溢价：** 美俄博弈将持续体现在油气价格上。
        *   **军工持续订单：** 危机氛围下，军火商订单有保障。
        *   **资本流向重塑：** 欧洲边缘化可能导致资本外流，资金转向美股核心资产或亚太新兴市场。

**核心结论：**
阿拉斯加会晤虽无即时协议，但深刻重塑了全球权力认知，凸显了美俄战略博弈的主导地位，同时将欧洲推向边缘，预示着能源、军工及全球资本流向的长期结构性转变。

**Overarching Framework (总体框架):**
阿拉斯加会晤是一场美俄两国领导人基于各自独特战略动机（特朗普的交易型利益驱动与普京的长期战略存在感追求），在排除欧洲与乌克兰的情况下进行的象征性权力博弈，其缺乏即时协议的表象，却深刻预塑了全球地缘政治格局与市场投资逻辑，预示着长期结构性变迁。

在阿拉斯加的这场会面 全球的目光都聚焦在一块冰冷而遥远的土地上 为什么？ 因为这是特朗普和普京 当今世界最具不确定性的两位领导人 首次在美国本土直接对话 你可以想象当时的画面 空军一号和俄罗斯专机同时停在军用机场 长长的红地毯从机库一直铺到停机坪 安保层层叠叠 记者镜头几乎没有间断 特朗普身边是白宫的核心幕僚 普京则带着长期负责安全和能源的智囊班子 两支队伍在闪光灯下短暂握手 寒暄几句后 便关上厚重的会议室大门 世界剩下的只能屏住呼吸， 等待结果 三个小时之后， 门开了 但结果却让人心里一凉 没有停火声明 没有具体协议 甚至连惯常的记者问答环节都被取消 特朗普留下一句意味深长的话 没有协议 直到有协议 而普京则一如既往地微笑着说 会谈富有成果 但需要更多时间 这两句话， 表面礼貌， 实则虚无 市场原本期待一个方向感 结果却只得到一场模棱两可的表演 更耐人寻味的是 这场围绕乌克兰问题的核心对话 乌克兰本人没在 欧洲主要盟友也被排除在外 一盘原本该有十几个人的棋局 最后只剩两位大佬单挑 要理解这场会谈的真意 必须先看两位领导人的性格和动机 特朗普是典型的“交易型总统” 他对意识形态没兴趣 更不会去宣传什么国际秩序 他的逻辑很简单 每一次外交会面 都是一场买卖 你给我什么筹码 我就能给你什么回报 你能出更多筹码 我甚至可以把传统盟友的利益摆在一边 这种思维我们已经见过太多次 比如他要求日本、 韩国增加驻军经费 否则就撤走美军 又比如他公开对沙特说 如果没有美国保护 你们撑不过两周 随后立刻用军售合同把几百亿美金装进美国军火商的口袋 特朗普的算盘从来都是清清楚楚的——利益最大化 而不是理念对齐 而普京则完全是另一套逻辑 他的外交哲学是“长期战略消耗” 在他的字典里 没有短期交易的满足感 只有大国地位的巩固和战略空间的扩张 过去二十年， 他一直在做一件事 让俄罗斯重新站上世界舞台 无论是格鲁吉亚战争、 克里米亚危机 还是如今的乌克兰战事 普京展示的都是耐心和坚持 他很清楚， 制裁会拖垮经济 但只要社会能维持基本稳定 俄罗斯就能等 等到西方社会的团结出现裂缝 等到欧洲能源安全再次被逼入死角 对普京而言 这次会谈不需要立刻有结果 他真正要的 是通过在美国本土和特朗普平起平坐的场景 向全世界释放信号 俄罗斯不是被孤立的失败者 而是任何全球议题中都绕不开的参与者 所以你看， 两种性格 两种逻辑 注定这场会谈难以诞生所谓的“突破” 特朗普要的是筹码 可以带回去向美国选民炫耀 普京要的是姿态 可以传递给国内民众和国际舆论 会谈没有协议 反而恰恰符合了双方的需求 特朗普可以说我强硬 没有随便让步 普京则可以说俄罗斯仍然在和美国平等对话 这就是为什么三个小时谈完 外界得到的只是一句“需要更多时间” 如果说这场阿拉斯加会谈最让人震惊的地方 不在于谈了什么 而在于谁没有被邀请 乌克兰缺席， 这已经足够讽刺 但更致命的是 欧洲整体都被排除在外 想一想， 这意味着什么？ 一场本应决定欧洲安全的核心谈判 却发生在大洋彼岸 欧洲人只能隔着电视机看新闻 这就像你家着火了 邻居跑去跟纵火的人谈判 结果没让你进屋 这种被边缘化的屈辱感 正是欧洲如今的真实写照 为什么特朗普要这么做？ 原因其实不复杂 他从上任那一天起 就对北约和欧盟充满不满 他多次公开指责欧洲国家“搭便车” 说美国为欧洲的安全买单太久了 而欧洲却拿着省下来的钱发展福利和产业 他甚至在竞选集会上放话 如果欧洲不交保护费 那就别指望美国士兵为他们流血 这样的逻辑放在乌克兰战争上 就变成了： 美国为什么要为基辅无限输血？ 如果这笔买卖得不到好处 那就没有继续投入的必要 而对普京来说 欧洲缺席则是一种战略胜利 自战争爆发以来， 他的最大目标之一 就是要打掉西方内部的团结 只要欧洲被边缘化 乌克兰就会被边缘化 只要乌克兰被边缘化 俄罗斯就能在谈判中争取更大的筹码 换句话说， 这场“双普会” 本身就是对欧洲的一个当头棒喝 你们不是谈判的主角 你们只是结果的接受者 从历史角度看 这种格局并不是第一次出现 冷战期间 美苏的峰会往往决定了整个欧洲的命运 从古巴导弹危机到赫尔辛基协议 欧洲国家往往只是被动接受美苏达成的平衡 如今的阿拉斯加会谈 让人不禁联想到冷战的翻版 欧洲再次被排除在外 而大国博弈重新回到双边游戏 这对欧洲意味着什么？ 意味着失去议价权 过去两年 德国拼命想摆脱对俄罗斯天然气的依赖 但北溪管道被炸后 德国工业的能源成本一路飙升 法国不断呼吁要保持战略自主 但在北约和美国的压制下 法国的声音显得苍白无力 东欧国家表面强硬 但在武器和资金供应上完全依赖美国 阿拉斯加会谈这一幕 等于再次提醒欧洲 你们所谓的团结 不过是美国手里的工具 真到关键时刻 决定权依旧不在布鲁塞尔 而在华盛顿和莫斯科 更可怕的是 这种被边缘化不仅是政治上的 还可能带来经济上的连锁反应 欧洲资本市场近两年已经明显落后于美股和亚太市场 资金流入量不断下滑 如果投资者意识到欧洲在全球谈判桌上的地位越来越低 那么资本外流的速度只会进一步加快 对于一个已经深陷能源危机、 经济复苏乏力的欧洲来说 这几乎是雪上加霜 所以 当阿拉斯加的会议室大门关闭时 最焦虑的并不是华盛顿或莫斯科 而是柏林、 巴黎和布鲁塞尔 因为他们知道 这场会谈的每一个细节 都可能决定欧洲未来十年的地缘格局 而他们却连旁听的资格都没有 如果说欧洲的缺席让人看到“谁在失势” 那么普京的登场则告诉世界“谁在回归” 外界很多评论认为 这场阿拉斯加会谈 普京最大的收获不是谈判结果 而是“存在感” 这话听起来轻飘 但对俄罗斯来说却是实打实的政治资本 你要知道， 自从乌克兰战事爆发后 西方媒体几乎一边倒地渲染俄罗斯的孤立 G7、 北约、 欧盟接二连三地宣布制裁 甚至一度出现“俄罗斯要被踢出全球金融体系”的论调 但两年过去了， 俄罗斯不仅没有倒下 普京本人还堂而皇之地走进了美国本土的谈判桌 和特朗普平起平坐 这种象征意义 本身就足以冲击西方叙事 在国内， 这种场面会被无限放大 俄罗斯的媒体已经把这次会晤渲染成“历史性时刻” 美国总统主动邀请俄罗斯总统在阿拉斯加对话 这是对俄罗斯地位的承认 对于长期忍受通胀、 失业、 制裁压力的普通民众来说 这种心理安慰至关重要 普京可以借此告诉国人 即便西方制裁再狠 俄罗斯依然是世界棋局的核心玩家 依然有人愿意和我们谈 对一个经历过 90 年代混乱的国家来说 “我们不是被遗忘的失败者”这句话 比任何物质奖励都更能稳住社会情绪 在国际层面 普京也通过这场会谈完成了一次“战略秀肌肉” 他并没有在会场上做出任何实质让步 却巧妙地把自己包装成“不可或缺的对话者” 这种操作其实很熟悉 冷战时期的苏联 就是靠不断制造谈判场合来证明自身地位 如今的俄罗斯实力虽不如苏联 但普京依旧深谙这套逻辑 只要能让美国坐到桌前 那无论结果如何， 俄罗斯就是赢家 更深一层的意义在于 普京借这场会晤打破了西方“孤立俄罗斯”的舆论框架 过去两年 拜登政府不断强调“民主国家必须团结” 欧洲领导人也在各种峰会上宣称“俄罗斯会被边缘化” 但阿拉斯加的一幕证明 到了关键时刻 真正握有决策权的还是美俄 而不是美欧 普京通过这场会谈 不仅让自己“重返全球舞台” 还成功向亚洲、 中东、 甚至非洲的伙伴展示 和俄罗斯合作并不会让你孤立 反而可能让你在大国博弈中获得更多回旋空间 普京的国内收益同样不容低估 在俄罗斯体制下 社会对领导人的支持率与国家在国际舞台上的地位高度绑定 每一次高调的国际亮相 都会直接转化为国内支持度 这也是为什么克里姆林宫在宣传时 极力凸显普京的“强人形象” 会场上的微笑、 与特朗普的眼神交流、 那些意味深长的停顿 都成了俄媒口中的“战略自信” 对普京本人而言 这不仅仅是一场外交行动 更是一场国内政治动员 说到底， 这场会谈对普京而言 哪怕没有任何实质协议 他依旧能宣称“俄罗斯赢了” 因为在一个讲求象征和舆论的世界里 哪怕只是一张照片、 一段画面 都可能比协议文本更有力量 相比普京的“战略存在感” 特朗普的算盘就显得更直接、 更功利 很多人说 他是美国历史上最不像总统的总统 没有高高在上的学者腔 没有长篇大论的意识形态 做事就是一个原则 利益摆在桌面上 谁能给我更多筹码， 我就跟谁合作 这种思维其实贯穿了他的整个政治生涯 还记得 2017 年他第一次执政时的场景吗？ 特朗普要求日本和韩国增加驻军费用 否则就减少美军驻军规模 他把北约叫到白宫 直言 如果你们不掏钱 美国就不保护你们 他甚至公开对沙特喊话 没有美国 你们的政权两周都撑不下去 这番话当时震惊世界 但随后 沙特用巨额军购合同“买”来了美国的保护 特朗普的手法， 说白了就是一句话 你要安全， 那就付钱 到了 2025 年， 特朗普卷土重来 他的“生意人式外交”更加娴熟 他明白 美国选民最关心的不是国际秩序 而是就业、 通胀和能源价格 所以， 阿拉斯加会谈对他来说 最重要的不是乌克兰能不能停火 而是能不能用这场谈判换回对自己有利的筹码 比如 俄罗斯是否能在能源供应上做一些配合 让油价别冲得太猛 比如 是否能在中东博弈中与美国保持默契 避免美国在多条战线上分心 甚至 是否能让欧洲国家在安全议题上更多依赖美国 从而逼迫他们增加军费开支 这背后的逻辑是清楚的 特朗普要用“制造危机”和“解决危机”来为自己加分 他可以告诉选民 美国敢于直接面对俄罗斯 美国总统亲自坐在谈判桌上 没有任何国家敢绕开我们 这种姿态在国内政治叙事中 比真正的停火协议更有分量 换句话说 特朗普要的不是“解决乌克兰” 而是“证明美国强硬” 同时把这个形象变成选票和经济利益 市场对此的反应， 却显得异常冷静 会谈结束的当天 美股三大指数并没有剧烈波动 能源和军工板块的 ETF 甚至只是轻微异动 为什么？ 因为资本市场的老玩家们心里很清楚 这种大国会晤 短期几乎不会有具体结果 但长期一定会改变格局 于是资金选择了观望， 表面平静 实际上在暗暗调整仓位 你能看到美债收益率小幅下行 说明资金有避险动作 能看到部分资金悄悄流入黄金、 原油和防御性资产 也能看到美股的波动率指数 VIX 轻微抬头 像是一种“先防一手”的预警 换句话说 资本市场对这场会谈的解读是 结果可以等， 但风险要先算 表面上看， 华尔街没怎么动 其实背后已经在重新评估三个关键方向 能源的安全溢价、 军工的持续订单 以及美元主导地位是否会受到挑战 这些方向， 不是凭空编造出来的 而是资本用真金白银下注的逻辑 正因为如此， 当我们谈投资落点时 不需要生硬地去“套板块” 而是顺着会谈释放的信号去推演 特朗普要用危机换利益 那美国必然会在能源与军工上继续做文章 普京要用存在感证明俄罗斯未被孤立 那俄罗斯相关的博弈一定会延伸到新兴市场 而欧洲被边缘化 则可能在未来几年持续引发资本的外流 这三条脉络 就是市场正在重新评估的焦点 如果我们把阿拉斯加这场“双普会”看成一盘棋 那普京要的是存在感 特朗普要的是筹码 而欧洲则被迫坐在了边缘 表面上 这是一场没有宣布结果的对话 但它释放出的信号足够让市场提前行动 能源的安全溢价不会消失 美国和俄罗斯的博弈最终会体现在油价和天然气价格上 军工订单的故事还远没有结束 只要危机的氛围存在 美国的军火商就不会缺客户 而欧洲的边缘化 将在未来几年持续拖累资本市场 欧洲资产可能在悄悄流出 而这些钱要么涌向美股的核心资产 要么转向亚洲和新兴市场 换句话说 这场会谈没有签署任何条约 但却在市场里埋下了三条逻辑 能源的价格锚、 军工的订单锚 以及资本的流向锚 真正聪明的投资者 不会去等白宫或克里姆林宫的新闻稿 而是会提前去布局这些方向 所以问题来了 在这场看似无声、 实则暗流涌动的博弈里 你会选择站在哪一边？ 是跟随资本的脚步， 提前能源与军工 还是去赌一把新兴市场的崛起？ 看到这里的朋友 飞飞也一如既往给大家准备好了这次的应对清单 针对这场“双普会” 我在市场里看到的不是表面的平静 而是更多的风险与动荡 过去一路领涨的科技股 可能要进入休整期 而新的方向， 正在悄悄取代它们 成为拉升美股估值的核心力量 具体的标的 我已经整理好放进清单里了 不光有公司名称 还附上了逻辑推演和风险拆解 老规矩， 点击评论区置顶的链接 输入今天的暗号【美俄】

我是飞飞， 我们下期视频再见！ This meeting in Alaska The eyes of the world are focused on a cold and distant land Why? Because this is Trump and Putin The two most uncertain leaders in the world today First direct conversation on American soil You can imagine the scene at that time: Air Force One and Russian aircraft are parked at a military airport at the same time Long red carpets spread from the hangar to the tarmac Security Layers Journalist footage is almost uninterrupted Trump is surrounded by a core White House staff Putin, for his part, brings with him a long-standing think tank on security and energy The two teams briefly shook hands under the flash After a few pleasantries They closed the heavy conference room door The rest of the world can only hold its breath and wait for the result After three hours, the door opened But the result is chilling No ceasefire statement No specific agreement Even the usual Q & A session was cancelled Trump left a meaningful message No agreement Until there is an agreement And Putin, as always, smiled and said The talks were fruitful But it takes more time "These two sentences are polite on the surface, but in reality they are nothing The market was expecting a sense of direction And you get an ambiguous performance. Even more intriguing is: This central conversation on Ukraine Ukraine itself is not present Key European allies were also left out A chess game that was supposed to have more than a dozen people In the end, only two bosses were left to fight one-on-one To understand the true meaning of this meeting You have to look at the personalities and motivations of the two leaders. Trump is a classic "transactional president". He's not interested in ideology. I will not promote any international order His logic was simple. Every diplomatic meeting It's all a business What chips are you giving me? What can I give you in return? You have more leverage. I can even set aside the interests of traditional allies We have seen this kind of thinking too many times. For example, he asked Japan and South Korea to increase their military spending Otherwise, withdraw the US troops. For example, he publicly told Saudi Arabia "Without American protection You can't last two weeks ", And immediately put tens of billions of dollars into the pockets of U.S. arms dealers with arms sales contracts Trump's calculus has always been clear - maximizing profit Rather than idea alignment Putin is a different logic altogether. His foreign policy philosophy is "long-term strategic attrition." In his dictionary Without the satisfaction of short-term transactions Only the consolidation of great power status and the expansion of strategic space For the past 20 years, he has been doing one thing: Let Russia return to the world stage Whether it is the Georgian War or the Crimean Crisis Or the war in Ukraine today? Putin shows patience and perseverance He is well aware that sanctions will bring down the economy But as long as society can maintain basic stability Russia can wait Until the unity of Western society cracks Wait until Europe's energy security is once again forced into a corner For Putin There is no need for an immediate result in this meeting What he really wants It's through a scene of being on par with Trump on American soil Sending a signal to the world: Russia is not an isolated loser It is an indispensable player in any global issue So you see, two personalities. Two logics It is destined that this meeting will not produce a so-called "breakthrough". Trump wants leverage Can be taken back to show off to American voters; What Putin wants is posture Can be passed on to the domestic public and international public opinion The talks ended without agreement Instead, it precisely meets the needs of both parties Trump can say, "I'm tough. No concessions at will Putin can say that "Russia is still talking to the United States as an equal." That's why it takes three hours. All the outside world got was "more time is needed". If there was one big shock about the Alaska talks It's not about what we talked about It's about who wasn't invited. Ukraine's absence is ironic enough; But even more deadly Europe as a whole is excluded Think about it. What does that mean? A central negotiation that was supposed to determine European security But it happened on the other side of the ocean Europeans can only watch the news through the TV It's like your house is on fire. Neighbors run to negotiate with arsonists I didn't let you in the house This humiliation of marginalization It is a true portrayal of Europe today Why would Trump do this? The reason is not complicated From the day he took office With NATO and the European Union He has repeatedly publicly accused European countries of "free riding", The United States has been paying for Europe's security for too long And Europe is using the savings to develop welfare and industry He even spoke at campaign rallies If Europe does not pay the protection fee Then don't expect American soldiers to bleed for them "Such logic applies to the war in Ukraine It becomes: Why is the United States providing unlimited blood transfusions to Kiev? If the deal doesn't pay off Then there is no need to continue investing And for Putin Europe's absence is a strategic victory Since the outbreak of the war, one of his greatest goals has been Is to break down the unity within the West As long as Europe is marginalized Ukraine would be marginalized. As long as Ukraine is marginalized Russia can gain more leverage in the negotiations In other words, this "Double General Meeting", It is a blow to Europe in itself. You are not the protagonists in the negotiation. You are just the recipients of the results. From a historical perspective This is not the first time this pattern has emerged During the Cold War Summits between the United States and the Soviet Union often determine the fate of the whole of Europe From the Cuban Missile Crisis to the Helsinki Accord European countries often just passively accept the balance reached by the United States and the Soviet Union Alaska Talks Today It is reminiscent of a replica of the Cold War. Europe is once again excluded The great power game is back to the bilateral game What does this mean for Europe? It means losing bargaining power In the past two years Germany is desperate to wean itself off its dependence on Russian natural gas But after the Nord Stream pipeline was bombed Energy costs for German industry are soaring. France continues to call for strategic autonomy But under the pressure of NATO and the United States The French voice was pale and feeble; Eastern European countries appear tough But completely dependent on the United States for arms and funding Alaska talks this scene It is equivalent to reminding Europe again What you call unity It's just a tool in the hands of the United States It really comes down to it. The decision is still not in Brussels And in Washington and Moscow And here's what's even scarier. This marginalization is not just political It could also have economic ripple effects European capital markets have significantly lagged behind US stocks and Asia Pacific markets in the past two years Capital inflows continue to decline If investors realize that Europe is getting lower and lower at the global negotiating table Then capital outflows will only accelerate further For a Europe already mired in an energy crisis and a sluggish economic recovery It almost adds insult to injury. So When the conference room doors in Alaska closed The most anxious people are not in Washington or Moscow It was Berlin and Paris and Brussels. Because they know Every detail of this meeting Could determine Europe's geopolitical landscape for the next decade And they're not even qualified to sit in If Europe's absence shows "who is losing", Then Putin's appearance tells the world "who is returning". Many outside commentators believe that The Alaskan Talks Putin's greatest achievement is not the outcome of negotiations It's "presence". That sounds light. But it is real political capital for Russia You know, since the war in Ukraine broke out The Western media almost overwhelmingly portrayed Russia's isolation G7, NATO, European Union announce sanctions one after another There was even talk of "Russia being kicked out of the global financial system" at one point But two years later, not only has Russia not collapsed Putin himself has also walked into the negotiating table in the United States with pride Equal with Trump This symbolism That alone is enough to shock the Western narrative. In China, this scene will be magnified infinitely Russian media have portrayed the meeting as a "historic moment": The US president has invited the Russian president to talk in Alaska This is recognition of Russia's status For ordinary people who have long endured the pressure of inflation, unemployment, and sanctions This psychological comfort is crucial Putin can use this to tell people: No matter how severe Western sanctions are Russia remains a core player in the world chess game There are still people willing to talk to us For a country that lived through the chaos of the 1990s "We are not the forgotten losers." It stabilizes social emotions better than any material reward At the international level Putin also completed a "strategic show of muscle" through this meeting. He didn't really make any concessions on the floor. But it has cleverly packaged itself as an "indispensable interlocutor". This operation is actually very familiar The Soviet Union during the Cold War It's about proving yourself by constantly creating negotiating situations Today's Russia is not as powerful as the Soviet Union But Putin still grasps this logic: If only America could be brought to the table No matter the outcome, Russia is the winner The deeper significance lies in: Putin used this meeting to break the Western public opinion framework of "isolating Russia" In the past two years The Biden administration has repeatedly emphasized that "democracies must come together." European leaders have also declared at various summits that "Russia will be marginalized." But the scene in Alaska proves that It was a critical moment. It is the United States and Russia that really hold the decision-making power Rather than the US and Europe Putin passed the meeting Not only does it allow itself to "return to the global stage", It has also successfully demonstrated to partners in Asia, the Middle East, and even Africa that: Working with Russia will not isolate you Instead, it may give you more room for maneuver in the great power game Putin's domestic gains should not be underestimated either Under the Russian system Social support for leaders is highly tied to a country's status on the international stage Every high-profile international appearance Will directly translate into domestic support This is also why the Kremlin is promoting Highlighting Putin's "strongman image" The smiles at the venue, the eye contact with Trump, those meaningful pauses It has become the "strategic confidence" of the Russian media. For Putin himself This is more than just a diplomatic move It was a domestic political mobilization. Ultimately, this meeting is for Putin Even without any substantive agreement He can still claim that "Russia won." Because in a world of symbols and opinion Even if it's just a photo or a frame Could be more powerful than the text of the agreement Compared with Putin's "strategic presence", Trump's calculations appear more direct and utilitarian Many people say He is the least presidential president in American history. There is no such thing as a high academic tone Ideology without tirades. Doing things is a principle Interests are on the table Whoever can give me more chips, I will cooperate with whoever And that's been true throughout his political career. Remember the scene in 2017 when he first came to power? Trump asks Japan and South Korea to increase troop costs Otherwise, it will reduce the size of the US military presence. He summoned NATO to the White House bluntly If you don't pay The United States will not protect you. " He even publicly addressed Saudi Arabia No America Your regime won't last two weeks These words shocked the world But then Saudi Arabia "bought" US protection with huge arms purchase contracts Trump's approach, to put it bluntly, is one sentence: If you want to be safe, then pay By 2025, Trump will make a comeback His "businessperson diplomacy" is more adept He understands American voters are not primarily concerned about international order It's jobs, inflation and energy prices. Therefore, the Alaska talks were for him The most important thing is not whether Ukraine can cease fire But can you use this negotiation to get back the chips in your favor? For example Can Russia cooperate in energy supply? Keep the oil price from going too high. For example Can it maintain tacit understanding with the United States in the Middle East game? Avoid American distraction on multiple fronts. even Can European countries become more dependent on the United States for security issues? Forcing them to increase military spending The logic behind this is clear. Trump will use "creating a crisis" and "solving a crisis" to score points for himself He can tell voters The United States dares to confront Russia directly The president of the United States personally sits at the negotiating table No country dares to bypass us. This stance is reflected in the domestic political narrative They carry more weight than a real cease-fire. In other words Trump doesn't want to "fix Ukraine." It's "proof that America is tough." And turn that image into votes and economic benefits. The market's reaction to this has been unusually calm The day the talks ended The three major U.S. stock indexes did not fluctuate violently ETFs in the energy and military sectors are even slightly abnormal Why? Because old players in capital markets know very well: This kind of meeting of great powers Almost no concrete results in the short term But it will definitely change the pattern in the long run So the funds chose to wait and see, and the surface was calm In fact, secretly adjusting the position You can see that the U.S. Treasury yield has slightly declined Explain that the funds have hedging actions; You can see some money quietly flowing into gold, crude oil, and defensive assets. You can also see a slight increase in the volatility index VIX of US stocks It's like a "first-guard" warning In other words Capital markets interpreted the talks as: The result can wait, but the risk must be calculated first On the surface, Wall Street didn't move much In fact, three key directions have been reassessed behind the scenes: The security premium for energy, the continued order for the military industry And whether the dominance of the dollar will be challenged These directions are not made up out of thin air It's the logic of capital betting with real money That's why when we talk about where to invest There is no need to "set the plate" stiffly. They're following the signals from the talks. Trump will trade crisis for profits Then the United States will inevitably continue to make a fuss about energy and military industries; Putin wants to prove that Russia is not isolated Then the Russia-related game will definitely extend to emerging markets; Europe was marginalized It is likely to continue to generate capital outflows in the coming years These three veins It is the focus that the market is reassessing If we think of this "Shuangpu" in Alaska as a game of chess What Putin wants is a sense of presence Trump wants leverage And Europe has been forced to sit on the sidelines On the surface This is an unannounced conversation. But it sent enough signals for the market to move ahead The energy security premium is not going away The game between the United States and Russia will eventually be reflected in the price of oil and natural gas. The story of military orders is far from over As long as the atmosphere of crisis exists American arms dealers will not lack customers. The marginalization of Europe Will continue to weigh on capital markets in the coming years European assets may be quietly flowing out And that money is either going to the core assets of US stocks Or pivot to Asia and emerging markets In other words No treaty was signed at the talks But there are three logics buried in the market: Energy price anchor, military order anchor And capital flows to anchors Really smart investors Won't wait for a press release from the White House or the Kremlin But will layout these directions in advance So here's the question. In this seemingly silent, but actually undercurrent game Which side will you choose? It is to follow in the footsteps of capital and advance energy and military industry Or take a gamble on the rise of emerging markets?

In response to this "Double General Meeting", What I see in the market is not the calm on the surface It's more risk and volatility.
