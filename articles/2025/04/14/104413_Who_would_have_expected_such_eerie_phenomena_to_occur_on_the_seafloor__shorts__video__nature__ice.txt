好的，我将根据您提供的文本，生成一份结构清晰的概要、核心观点、框架，以及一个美观的 mermaid 概念图，并用简体中文呈现。

**概要：**

I. **冰的两种攻击方式：**
    A. **海冰下沉（冰柱）：**
        1. 海冰形成过程中，高盐度的盐水（卤水）下沉。
        2. 卤水迅速冻结周围海水，形成冰鞘。
        3. 冰鞘向下延伸，形成“冰柱”。
        4. 冰柱接触海底，冻结并杀死接触到的生物。
    B. **底层水上升：**
        1. 洋流将寒冷的底层水带到上层。
        2. 底层水结冰，覆盖无法移动的物体。
        3. 冰比水轻，漂浮上升，带走附着的生物。

II. **冰的清理作用：**
    A. 冰柱和底层水结冰都会清除海底生物。
    B. 上升的冰将海底生物残骸带到上层。

**核心观点：**

冰通过两种方式——下沉的冰柱和上升的冻结——清除海底生物，并在海洋中形成独特的生态过程。

**总体框架：**

这段文本描述了南极或北极等寒冷地区冰对海底生物的影响，主要围绕两种冰的形成和作用方式展开：一种是高盐度卤水形成的冰柱，直接冻结海底生物；另一种是寒冷的底层水上升并结冰，覆盖海底生物并将其带到上层。 总之就是冰的形成过程对海洋生物生存环境造成的影响。
