versus the comparison of the N8N agents versus the new Make. com AI agent By the end of this new Make. com AI agent By the end of this new Make. com AI agent By the end of this video you'll know exactly how the N8N video you'll know exactly how the N8N video you'll know exactly how the N8N and Make agents work and how they are and Make agents work and how they are and Make agents work and how they are different And stick around till the end different And stick around till the end different And stick around till the end and I'll tell you which one I like and I'll tell you which one I like and I'll tell you which one I like better Let's do it So for testing I've better Let's do it So for testing I've better Let's do it So for testing I've been using Telegram as a chat interface been using Telegram as a chat interface been using Telegram as a chat interface to help me generate images or to help me to help me generate images or to help me to help me generate images or to help me write an email Just something that I write an email Just something that I write an email Just something that I could use to compare the two with two could use to compare the two with two could use to compare the two with two different tools just to see how they different tools just to see how they different tools just to see how they work differently Here is the agent that work differently Here is the agent that work differently Here is the agent that I built out in nadn that generates the I built out in nadn that generates the I built out in nadn that generates the image and writes the email and responds image and writes the email and responds image and writes the email and responds back to telegram And then here is the back to telegram And then here is the back to telegram And then here is the make. com agent that takes in the message make. com agent that takes in the message make. com agent that takes in the message from telegram and the two different from telegram and the two different from telegram and the two different tools to write an email and to generate tools to write an email and to generate tools to write an email and to generate an image and then finally to respond an image and then finally to respond an image and then finally to respond back to telegram Now I'm going to go back to telegram Now I'm going to go back to telegram Now I'm going to go ahead and start in make because these ahead and start in make because these ahead and start in make because these are the newest to arrive on the market are the newest to arrive on the market are the newest to arrive on the market When you log into make you are going to When you log into make you are going to When you log into make you are going to see the AI agents beta right here If see the AI agents beta right here If see the AI agents beta right here If it's not here for you it should be it's not here for you it should be it's not here for you it should be rolled out soon Here I already have an rolled out soon Here I already have an rolled out soon Here I already have an existing agent but you can go ahead and existing agent but you can go ahead and existing agent but you can go ahead and create a new one over here On the create a new one over here On the create a new one over here On the connection here this is where you're connection here this is where you're connection here this is where you're going to connect it to an AI model and going to connect it to an AI model and going to connect it to an AI model and you can go ahead and add in those you can go ahead and add in those you can go ahead and add in those credentials here I already have an credentials here I already have an credentials here I already have an existing one I'm going to go ahead and existing one I'm going to go ahead and existing one I'm going to go ahead and use OpenAI for this example And then you use OpenAI for this example And then you use OpenAI for this example And then you give your agent a name and then you're give your agent a name and then you're give your agent a name and then you're going to pick a model I already have an going to pick a model I already have an going to pick a model I already have an agent built but you would go ahead and agent built but you would go ahead and agent built but you would go ahead and pick a model And then you would go ahead pick a model And then you would go ahead pick a model And then you would go ahead and add in your system prompt Looks like and add in your system prompt Looks like and add in your system prompt Looks like I forgot to give it a name I forgot to give it a name I forgot to give it a name And then you can go ahead and save it And then you can go ahead and save it And then you can go ahead and save it Then it takes you to this screen where Then it takes you to this screen where Then it takes you to this screen where you can adjust the prompt and then you you can adjust the prompt and then you you can adjust the prompt and then you can add in the different tools Now the can add in the different tools Now the can add in the different tools Now the way they do this is that they allow you way they do this is that they allow you way they do this is that they allow you to essentially use any of your other to essentially use any of your other to essentially use any of your other scenarios as a tool So you can start to scenarios as a tool So you can start to scenarios as a tool So you can start to think of your scenarios as a function think of your scenarios as a function think of your scenarios as a function which is pretty cool and they can be which is pretty cool and they can be which is pretty cool and they can be reusable So you can go through your reusable So you can go through your reusable So you can go through your folders come down here to the folder I folders come down here to the folder I folders come down here to the folder I created for this video and then we could created for this video and then we could created for this video and then we could go ahead and pick our two different go ahead and pick our two different go ahead and pick our two different tools I'm going to go ahead and add a tools I'm going to go ahead and add a tools I'm going to go ahead and add a description here cuz it says I need one description here cuz it says I need one description here cuz it says I need one This tool is for writing emails So I This tool is for writing emails So I This tool is for writing emails So I could add these two tools to my agent So could add these two tools to my agent So could add these two tools to my agent So now we have the system prompt and the now we have the system prompt and the now we have the system prompt and the tools and some other agent settings here tools and some other agent settings here tools and some other agent settings here These were the ones that we put in These were the ones that we put in These were the ones that we put in originally And then you could go ahead originally And then you could go ahead originally And then you could go ahead and save your agent Now I already have a and save your agent Now I already have a and save your agent Now I already have a complete agent already built out And complete agent already built out And complete agent already built out And then here are the two different tools then here are the two different tools then here are the two different tools that I built out that we just added to that I built out that we just added to that I built out that we just added to the test agent that are also connected the test agent that are also connected the test agent that are also connected up with the existing agent So the way up with the existing agent So the way up with the existing agent So the way you do this is you have a traditional you do this is you have a traditional you do this is you have a traditional trigger In this case we have the trigger In this case we have the trigger In this case we have the Telegram bot I've already set up a Telegram bot I've already set up a Telegram bot I've already set up a connection It's connected to this connection It's connected to this connection It's connected to this Telegram account I have here the SGP Telegram account I have here the SGP Telegram account I have here the SGP assistant We can send it messages from assistant We can send it messages from assistant We can send it messages from the message here And then that is going the message here And then that is going the message here And then that is going to come in through the trigger and then to come in through the trigger and then to come in through the trigger and then go into the agent Again we can open up go into the agent Again we can open up go into the agent Again we can open up this agent and take a look It's going to this agent and take a look It's going to this agent and take a look It's going to look similar to the configuration screen look similar to the configuration screen look similar to the configuration screen where we have a specific agent that we where we have a specific agent that we where we have a specific agent that we selected Here are those system tools selected Here are those system tools selected Here are those system tools again that we already added You're going again that we already added You're going again that we already added You're going to pass in a thread ID This allows you to pass in a thread ID This allows you to pass in a thread ID This allows you to keep memory So we're passing in the to keep memory So we're passing in the to keep memory So we're passing in the chat ID from Telegram that allows the chat ID from Telegram that allows the chat ID from Telegram that allows the agent to store the memory from the agent to store the memory from the agent to store the memory from the conversations so that it can remember conversations so that it can remember conversations so that it can remember the context of any conversation And then the context of any conversation And then the context of any conversation And then you pass in the system instructions I you pass in the system instructions I you pass in the system instructions I happen to use the exact same system happen to use the exact same system happen to use the exact same system prompt that I used in NAN and they both prompt that I used in NAN and they both prompt that I used in NAN and they both work fine just copied and pasted from work fine just copied and pasted from work fine just copied and pasted from one to the other And then if we scroll one to the other And then if we scroll one to the other And then if we scroll down we have the message that we send down we have the message that we send down we have the message that we send into the agent that is coming from the into the agent that is coming from the into the agent that is coming from the trigger And then you're going to want to trigger And then you're going to want to trigger And then you're going to want to pay attention to this as well When you pay attention to this as well When you pay attention to this as well When you have an agent that runs for more than 3 have an agent that runs for more than 3 have an agent that runs for more than 3 minutes they suggest that you use a web minutes they suggest that you use a web minutes they suggest that you use a web hook The requests I'm using today are hook The requests I'm using today are hook The requests I'm using today are pretty simple So I have this on no but pretty simple So I have this on no but pretty simple So I have this on no but if you click to yes it would allow you if you click to yes it would allow you if you click to yes it would allow you to add a web hook and then instead of to add a web hook and then instead of to add a web hook and then instead of responding directly it would fire off responding directly it would fire off responding directly it would fire off that web hook when you are ready So I'm that web hook when you are ready So I'm that web hook when you are ready So I'm going to go ahead and just hit cancel going to go ahead and just hit cancel going to go ahead and just hit cancel and get back to the original state And and get back to the original state And and get back to the original state And then of course this is the response back then of course this is the response back then of course this is the response back to Telegram once the agent has figured to Telegram once the agent has figured to Telegram once the agent has figured everything out So now if we jump over to everything out So now if we jump over to everything out So now if we jump over to the first tool write an email We can the first tool write an email We can the first tool write an email We can take a quick look at how this works The take a quick look at how this works The take a quick look at how this works The first step of your tool is going to be first step of your tool is going to be first step of your tool is going to be the action that you want to take And if the action that you want to take And if the action that you want to take And if we come into the tool itself as always we come into the tool itself as always we come into the tool itself as always you're going to set up your connection you're going to set up your connection you're going to set up your connection to your Gmail and then you're going to to your Gmail and then you're going to to your Gmail and then you're going to fill in the placeholders as you normally fill in the placeholders as you normally fill in the placeholders as you normally would The thing to keep in mind is is would The thing to keep in mind is is would The thing to keep in mind is is that the placeholders are not coming that the placeholders are not coming that the placeholders are not coming from where we are used to seeing which from where we are used to seeing which from where we are used to seeing which is in this here They are coming from is in this here They are coming from is in this here They are coming from over here And you can see we have these over here And you can see we have these over here And you can see we have these scenario inputs body subject and two And scenario inputs body subject and two And scenario inputs body subject and two And the way you define those is down here the way you define those is down here the way you define those is down here right here You can define the scenario right here You can define the scenario right here You can define the scenario inputs So you can add these items just inputs So you can add these items just inputs So you can add these items just like this Here's how you add a new item like this Here's how you add a new item like this Here's how you add a new item And then you can also define the And then you can also define the And then you can also define the scenario outputs the ID So you can see scenario outputs the ID So you can see scenario outputs the ID So you can see in the response to the agent here I'm in the response to the agent here I'm in the response to the agent here I'm just responding back with the message ID just responding back with the message ID just responding back with the message ID So you just add your trigger as usual So you just add your trigger as usual So you just add your trigger as usual And then you just add this agent return And then you just add this agent return And then you just add this agent return output And then it's going to be very output And then it's going to be very output And then it's going to be very similar to the generate image We have similar to the generate image We have similar to the generate image We have the open AI generate an image module the open AI generate an image module the open AI generate an image module here And we're also passing it in the here And we're also passing it in the here And we're also passing it in the prompt As you can imagine that's going prompt As you can imagine that's going prompt As you can imagine that's going to be set in your scenario inputs down to be set in your scenario inputs down to be set in your scenario inputs down here And then you can set up your image here And then you can set up your image here And then you can set up your image outputs which is the image URL which you outputs which is the image URL which you outputs which is the image URL which you can pass directly into the return output can pass directly into the return output can pass directly into the return output of the agent So if I back out here and of the agent So if I back out here and of the agent So if I back out here and back out of this one here so we can see back out of this one here so we can see back out of this one here so we can see everything running and then back out of everything running and then back out of everything running and then back out of this one as well We can go ahead and this one as well We can go ahead and this one as well We can go ahead and turn on this agent I'm going to delete turn on this agent I'm going to delete turn on this agent I'm going to delete the old the old the old data We can jump over to the SGP data We can jump over to the SGP data We can jump over to the SGP assistant Please write Stephen at SGP assistant Please write Stephen at SGP assistant Please write Stephen at SGP Labs an email about getting together Labs an email about getting together Labs an email about getting together this weekend So we can go ahead and put this weekend So we can go ahead and put this weekend So we can go ahead and put that in Jump back to our agent We can that in Jump back to our agent We can that in Jump back to our agent We can see it's working here And what we can see it's working here And what we can see it's working here And what we can also see is it's starting to call the also see is it's starting to call the also see is it's starting to call the specific tools And as always you can dig specific tools And as always you can dig specific tools And as always you can dig into the specific information that is into the specific information that is into the specific information that is flowing through the automation and the flowing through the automation and the flowing through the automation and the response And then if we come back to the response And then if we come back to the response And then if we come back to the actual run here you can actually come in actual run here you can actually come in actual run here you can actually come in here and see the actual execution steps here and see the actual execution steps here and see the actual execution steps and the detailed information about how and the detailed information about how and the detailed information about how the agent made its decision So we can the agent made its decision So we can the agent made its decision So we can see all of the different execution steps see all of the different execution steps see all of the different execution steps here and all the little details of how here and all the little details of how here and all the little details of how it went about everything that it just it went about everything that it just it went about everything that it just did And then you can see it responded did And then you can see it responded did And then you can see it responded back to Telegram as you might expect The back to Telegram as you might expect The back to Telegram as you might expect The email has been successfully sent Now I email has been successfully sent Now I email has been successfully sent Now I am creating just drafts here So if I am creating just drafts here So if I am creating just drafts here So if I come over here we can see we have a come over here we can see we have a come over here we can see we have a draft meeting up this weekend And then draft meeting up this weekend And then draft meeting up this weekend And then we have the message to myself And then we have the message to myself And then we have the message to myself And then to use the other tool we can say create to use the other tool we can say create to use the other tool we can say create an image of a man riding a bike We can an image of a man riding a bike We can an image of a man riding a bike We can jump back over to make We can see that jump back over to make We can see that jump back over to make We can see that run really fast right there And of run really fast right there And of run really fast right there And of course again you can take a look at the course again you can take a look at the course again you can take a look at the response and everything that happened response and everything that happened response and everything that happened here And you can see that it flowed here And you can see that it flowed here And you can see that it flowed through here as well We can take a look through here as well We can take a look through here as well We can take a look at the actual data We've got the image at the actual data We've got the image at the actual data We've got the image here Everything looks good And then we here Everything looks good And then we here Everything looks good And then we can come back to the assistant We've got can come back to the assistant We've got can come back to the assistant We've got that image If we clicked on it there's that image If we clicked on it there's that image If we clicked on it there's the man on the bike So overall pretty the man on the bike So overall pretty the man on the bike So overall pretty straightforward In typical fashion we straightforward In typical fashion we straightforward In typical fashion we can always monitor the output and debug can always monitor the output and debug can always monitor the output and debug how everything was calculated as we can how everything was calculated as we can how everything was calculated as we can with make all the time But now let's with make all the time But now let's with make all the time But now let's jump over to N8N and start to compare jump over to N8N and start to compare jump over to N8N and start to compare the two agents So first and foremost I the two agents So first and foremost I the two agents So first and foremost I think the first thing that you notice think the first thing that you notice think the first thing that you notice here is that everything is quite a bit here is that everything is quite a bit here is that everything is quite a bit more visual in the sense that in make in more visual in the sense that in make in more visual in the sense that in make in order to visualize our agent we have to order to visualize our agent we have to order to visualize our agent we have to see it as different scenarios here The see it as different scenarios here The see it as different scenarios here The memory and the model we're using and any memory and the model we're using and any memory and the model we're using and any of its settings are a bit more hidden of its settings are a bit more hidden of its settings are a bit more hidden and you have to go into the individual and you have to go into the individual and you have to go into the individual settings or you actually have to go into settings or you actually have to go into settings or you actually have to go into the configuration of the agent in order the configuration of the agent in order the configuration of the agent in order to get access to those elements or even to get access to those elements or even to get access to those elements or even to see them Whereas make you start to to see them Whereas make you start to to see them Whereas make you start to see that your model is right here If you see that your model is right here If you see that your model is right here If you wanted to change it you would just wanted to change it you would just wanted to change it you would just disconnect it and add a new model Your disconnect it and add a new model Your disconnect it and add a new model Your memory is right here as well If you memory is right here as well If you memory is right here as well If you remember in make that was stored within remember in make that was stored within remember in make that was stored within the thread ID here Whereas in NADN it's the thread ID here Whereas in NADN it's the thread ID here Whereas in NADN it's laid out just like this And we can laid out just like this And we can laid out just like this And we can replace this with other tools And you replace this with other tools And you replace this with other tools And you can see we also have our tools connected can see we also have our tools connected can see we also have our tools connected right here One of the nice things about right here One of the nice things about right here One of the nice things about NAND is that a lot of the tools are NAND is that a lot of the tools are NAND is that a lot of the tools are already available to you and you don't already available to you and you don't already available to you and you don't necessarily have to create another necessarily have to create another necessarily have to create another scenario So now there are times where scenario So now there are times where scenario So now there are times where you do like in this case So you can see you do like in this case So you can see you do like in this case So you can see here if I go into this tool here this here if I go into this tool here this here if I go into this tool here this specific tool is actually calling a specific tool is actually calling a specific tool is actually calling a different workflow and it feels a bit different workflow and it feels a bit different workflow and it feels a bit more like make where you have a separate more like make where you have a separate more like make where you have a separate scenario And you have to do this when scenario And you have to do this when scenario And you have to do this when you examine the tools along the right you examine the tools along the right you examine the tools along the right hand side and you just can't find the hand side and you just can't find the hand side and you just can't find the tool that you need Whereas a lot of the tool that you need Whereas a lot of the tool that you need Whereas a lot of the tools are built in So you don't actually tools are built in So you don't actually tools are built in So you don't actually have to build out a complete scenario So have to build out a complete scenario So have to build out a complete scenario So in make every single one of your tools in make every single one of your tools in make every single one of your tools is a separate scenario Whereas in N8N is a separate scenario Whereas in N8N is a separate scenario Whereas in N8N they already have a bunch of tools that they already have a bunch of tools that they already have a bunch of tools that can be integrated directly into a single can be integrated directly into a single can be integrated directly into a single scenario so that you don't have to have scenario so that you don't have to have scenario so that you don't have to have all of these separate workflows for each all of these separate workflows for each all of these separate workflows for each individual tool which can become a pain individual tool which can become a pain individual tool which can become a pain Now let's go ahead and just run this one Now let's go ahead and just run this one Now let's go ahead and just run this one time Let's test this workflow Let's jump time Let's test this workflow Let's jump time Let's test this workflow Let's jump back to the assistant and say "Please back to the assistant and say "Please back to the assistant and say "Please create me an image of a man on a create me an image of a man on a create me an image of a man on a bike. " All right let's jump back to N8N bike. " All right let's jump back to N8N bike. " All right let's jump back to N8N And now we have the scenario running Now And now we have the scenario running Now And now we have the scenario running Now the other thing that I would mention the other thing that I would mention the other thing that I would mention here as well is that again this is much here as well is that again this is much here as well is that again this is much more visual in the sense that we can see more visual in the sense that we can see more visual in the sense that we can see the agent running We can see that it's the agent running We can see that it's the agent running We can see that it's generating the image When it's done with generating the image When it's done with generating the image When it's done with the image we can see that it's now going the image we can see that it's now going the image we can see that it's now going back to Open AI to figure out what we back to Open AI to figure out what we back to Open AI to figure out what we should write back to Telegram And then should write back to Telegram And then should write back to Telegram And then in this case I had two different outputs in this case I had two different outputs in this case I had two different outputs If it's a file I actually download it If it's a file I actually download it If it's a file I actually download it and send it so that we actually get the and send it so that we actually get the and send it so that we actually get the image here But the thing to note here is image here But the thing to note here is image here But the thing to note here is that it's just much more visual and you that it's just much more visual and you that it's just much more visual and you can see what's going on Now you can also can see what's going on Now you can also can see what's going on Now you can also come in here and you can see the exact come in here and you can see the exact come in here and you can see the exact output and how the agent was behaving output and how the agent was behaving output and how the agent was behaving You can look at the logs and then you You can look at the logs and then you You can look at the logs and then you can go deeper into the agent and look at can go deeper into the agent and look at can go deeper into the agent and look at the memory and then you can also look at the memory and then you can also look at the memory and then you can also look at the prompts that were sent to OpenAI and the prompts that were sent to OpenAI and the prompts that were sent to OpenAI and then all the different steps all along then all the different steps all along then all the different steps all along the way which is great But I think more the way which is great But I think more the way which is great But I think more than anything it just shows that using than anything it just shows that using than anything it just shows that using an agent is not just a linear action And an agent is not just a linear action And an agent is not just a linear action And in make it does feel a lot more linear in make it does feel a lot more linear in make it does feel a lot more linear Even though you can tell that it's going Even though you can tell that it's going Even though you can tell that it's going back and forth and it's doing these back and forth and it's doing these back and forth and it's doing these different things you just can't see it different things you just can't see it different things you just can't see it as well And I think that's just because as well And I think that's just because as well And I think that's just because of the way the make UI is designed It's of the way the make UI is designed It's of the way the make UI is designed It's always moving from left to right Whereas always moving from left to right Whereas always moving from left to right Whereas in N8N and generally it's moving this in N8N and generally it's moving this in N8N and generally it's moving this way But automations can come down here way But automations can come down here way But automations can come down here and they can come back up here and then and they can come back up here and then and they can come back up here and then they can come down over here and then they can come down over here and then they can come down over here and then they can go over there and then you can they can go over there and then you can they can go over there and then you can actually have them loop back again So actually have them loop back again So actually have them loop back again So the NADN interface in general is more the NADN interface in general is more the NADN interface in general is more flexible and more visual So you're flexible and more visual So you're flexible and more visual So you're really able to see a lot better in terms really able to see a lot better in terms really able to see a lot better in terms of what the agent's doing And believe it of what the agent's doing And believe it of what the agent's doing And believe it or not that does help a lot when you're or not that does help a lot when you're or not that does help a lot when you're designing these and having issues and designing these and having issues and designing these and having issues and just trying to understand how the agent just trying to understand how the agent just trying to understand how the agent is working If there is a flow that is is working If there is a flow that is is working If there is a flow that is not going the way you want sometimes in not going the way you want sometimes in not going the way you want sometimes in your automations your agent's going to your automations your agent's going to your automations your agent's going to use multiple tools together to perform a use multiple tools together to perform a use multiple tools together to perform a single action And if it's doing single action And if it's doing single action And if it's doing something in the wrong order and you something in the wrong order and you something in the wrong order and you have to go through your agent here and have to go through your agent here and have to go through your agent here and debug it this way through all of these debug it this way through all of these debug it this way through all of these different action steps and look through different action steps and look through different action steps and look through all this this is a lot to look through all this this is a lot to look through all this this is a lot to look through Whereas in N8N just visually you'd be Whereas in N8N just visually you'd be Whereas in N8N just visually you'd be able to identify the problem because you able to identify the problem because you able to identify the problem because you could see that it's going to this tool could see that it's going to this tool could see that it's going to this tool and then it goes to this one And you and then it goes to this one And you and then it goes to this one And you know that it's supposed to go to this know that it's supposed to go to this know that it's supposed to go to this one first and then to that one and then one first and then to that one and then one first and then to that one and then it's supposed to do this and then that it's supposed to do this and then that it's supposed to do this and then that and then come over here and then go out and then come over here and then go out and then come over here and then go out Just visually without even debugging it Just visually without even debugging it Just visually without even debugging it without going into the log you would be without going into the log you would be without going into the log you would be able to see that All right so let's test able to see that All right so let's test able to see that All right so let's test the other action as well I'm going to go the other action as well I'm going to go the other action as well I'm going to go ahead and test the workflow Come back to ahead and test the workflow Come back to ahead and test the workflow Come back to our assistant Please write stephen our assistant Please write stephen our assistant Please write stephen sjgplabs. com a message about getting sjgplabs. com a message about getting sjgplabs. com a message about getting together on the together on the together on the weekend Come back to our agent here weekend Come back to our agent here weekend Come back to our agent here again Notice how we just see it We can again Notice how we just see it We can again Notice how we just see it We can see it thinking And then this time see it thinking And then this time see it thinking And then this time because there was no image it came down because there was no image it came down because there was no image it came down this path again I added this little this path again I added this little this path again I added this little extra here so that if there's an image extra here so that if there's an image extra here so that if there's an image we download it and send it as an image we download it and send it as an image we download it and send it as an image post instead of just a URL And then here post instead of just a URL And then here post instead of just a URL And then here we can see we responded and we got the we can see we responded and we got the we can see we responded and we got the response just like that So in my honest response just like that So in my honest response just like that So in my honest opinion I think NADN agents are much opinion I think NADN agents are much opinion I think NADN agents are much more advanced and we've really only more advanced and we've really only more advanced and we've really only scratched the surface of what these can scratched the surface of what these can scratched the surface of what these can do They also have different types of do They also have different types of do They also have different types of agents They already have MCP agents So agents They already have MCP agents So agents They already have MCP agents So NADN is definitely moving very fast with NADN is definitely moving very fast with NADN is definitely moving very fast with their agent technology and Make is just their agent technology and Make is just their agent technology and Make is just starting to get into the game It'll be starting to get into the game It'll be starting to get into the game It'll be interesting to see how Make is able to interesting to see how Make is able to interesting to see how Make is able to keep up Now if you want to get access to keep up Now if you want to get access to keep up Now if you want to get access to these different templates here to play these different templates here to play these different templates here to play around yourself make sure to jump into around yourself make sure to jump into around yourself make sure to jump into the Noode Architects community You'll the Noode Architects community You'll the Noode Architects community You'll find those in the automation vault find those in the automation vault find those in the automation vault You'll also find our other NAND You'll also find our other NAND You'll also find our other NAND templates and our make templates There's templates and our make templates There's templates and our make templates There's a business clarity course and calls with a business clarity course and calls with a business clarity course and calls with me almost every single day Plus it's an me almost every single day Plus it's an me almost every single day Plus it's an engaged group of people You can get tech engaged group of people You can get tech engaged group of people You can get tech support We guarantee to solve 100% of support We guarantee to solve 100% of support We guarantee to solve 100% of our members tech issues And we also have our members tech issues And we also have our members tech issues And we also have an upcoming in-person mastermind It'd be an upcoming in-person mastermind It'd be an upcoming in-person mastermind It'd be great to see you there So I'd love to great to see you there So
