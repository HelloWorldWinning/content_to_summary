Number two, the best the events happen. Number two, the best the events happen. Number two, the best trading mentor you will ever have. Chad trading mentor you will ever have. Chad trading mentor you will ever have. Chad GPT knows more about trading than any GPT knows more about trading than any GPT knows more about trading than any human being alive and will answer any of human being alive and will answer any of human being alive and will answer any of your questions whether they be super your questions whether they be super your questions whether they be super smart or super simple. It will be very smart or super simple. It will be very smart or super simple. It will be very very patient with you and give you just very patient with you and give you just very patient with you and give you just the right answer that you need. One good the right answer that you need. One good the right answer that you need. One good example of this for example right now is example of this for example right now is example of this for example right now is something called the basis trade. This something called the basis trade. This something called the basis trade. This is a very convoluted complicated idea is a very convoluted complicated idea is a very convoluted complicated idea but it is threatening the financial but it is threatening the financial but it is threatening the financial markets all across the world. In fact, markets all across the world. In fact, markets all across the world. In fact, it was the foundational threat in 2018 it was the foundational threat in 2018 it was the foundational threat in 2018 and in CO in 2020. But most traders, and in CO in 2020. But most traders, and in CO in 2020. But most traders, most retail traders certainly are not most retail traders certainly are not most retail traders certainly are not even aware of what it is, much less how even aware of what it is, much less how even aware of what it is, much less how it works. Chad GPT can help you on that it works. Chad GPT can help you on that it works. Chad GPT can help you on that area and really make you far ahead of area and really make you far ahead of area and really make you far ahead of the crowd. So, a very simple query that the crowd. So, a very simple query that the crowd. So, a very simple query that we can ask it is something like this. we can ask it is something like this. we can ask it is something like this. I'm a retail trader, but I'm not well I'm a retail trader, but I'm not well I'm a retail trader, but I'm not well educated in economics or finance. Please educated in economics or finance. Please educated in economics or finance. Please explain to me in simple terms what is a explain to me in simple terms what is a explain to me in simple terms what is a basis trade, why is it popular, and why basis trade, why is it popular, and why basis trade, why is it popular, and why can it be a problem for the financial can it be a problem for the financial can it be a problem for the financial markets? And then just simply hit send markets? And then just simply hit send markets? And then just simply hit send and let's see what it comes up with. and let's see what it comes up with. and let's see what it comes up with. Here's a simple breakdown of what is a Here's a simple breakdown of what is a Here's a simple breakdown of what is a basis trade. A basis trade is when basis trade. A basis trade is when basis trade. A basis trade is when investors like hedge funds try to make investors like hedge funds try to make investors like hedge funds try to make money from small differences in price money from small differences in price money from small differences in price from two related things. from two related things. from two related things. In this case, it's essentially futures In this case, it's essentially futures In this case, it's essentially futures contracts and the actual underlying contracts and the actual underlying contracts and the actual underlying bonds that trade. So, what they're bonds that trade. So, what they're bonds that trade. So, what they're essentially saying is, hey, this bond essentially saying is, hey, this bond essentially saying is, hey, this bond costs one price now and in the futures costs one price now and in the futures costs one price now and in the futures contract, it is priced a little contract, it is priced a little contract, it is priced a little differently. So, let's buy one and sell differently. So, let's buy one and sell differently. So, let's buy one and sell the other because we're certain that the other because we're certain that the other because we're certain that that value is going to ultimately that value is going to ultimately that value is going to ultimately coincide to a single value. and that coincide to a single value. and that coincide to a single value. and that that uh coincision that basic move that uh coincision that basic move that uh coincision that basic move towards the single value is where we're towards the single value is where we're towards the single value is where we're going to have the profit. So the going to have the profit. So the going to have the profit. So the difference in price between two futures difference in price between two futures difference in price between two futures contracts is what creates the basis contracts is what creates the basis contracts is what creates the basis trade. Why is it popular? It's a lowrisk trade. Why is it popular? It's a lowrisk trade. Why is it popular? It's a lowrisk strategy. In theory, you're owning two strategy. In theory, you're owning two strategy. In theory, you're owning two of the exact same things. You don't have of the exact same things. You don't have of the exact same things. You don't have any directional risk. You don't have any any directional risk. You don't have any any directional risk. You don't have any instrument risk. That's always of course instrument risk. That's always of course instrument risk. That's always of course the theory. And the way you make money the theory. And the way you make money the theory. And the way you make money because the spreads the the difference because the spreads the the difference because the spreads the the difference in prices between the futures contracts in prices between the futures contracts in prices between the futures contracts and the underlying bonds tend to be very and the underlying bonds tend to be very and the underlying bonds tend to be very very small obviously um you need to be very small obviously um you need to be very small obviously um you need to be have to use a lot of leverage in order have to use a lot of leverage in order have to use a lot of leverage in order to be able to amplify those tiny pennies to be able to amplify those tiny pennies to be able to amplify those tiny pennies into millions and millions of dollars. into millions and millions of dollars. into millions and millions of dollars. That's how they make money. They use That's how they make money. They use That's how they make money. They use leverage to attain big profits. He leverage to attain big profits. He leverage to attain big profits. He creates steady returns and in safe and creates steady returns and in safe and creates steady returns and in safe and normal times it usually is a ability to normal times it usually is a ability to normal times it usually is a ability to basically print money with virtually no basically print money with virtually no basically print money with virtually no risk. But why can it be a problem? risk. But why can it be a problem? risk. But why can it be a problem? Here's when things get tricky. When Here's when things get tricky. When Here's when things get tricky. When people use too much leverage because the people use too much leverage because the people use too much leverage because the profits are small, traders can borrow profits are small, traders can borrow profits are small, traders can borrow huge amounts to make it worth it. And huge amounts to make it worth it. And huge amounts to make it worth it. And that means small market moves can cause that means small market moves can cause that means small market moves can cause massive losses. massive losses. massive losses. market stresses like when you have lots market stresses like when you have lots market stresses like when you have lots of uh stress right now that can create a of uh stress right now that can create a of uh stress right now that can create a breakdown between that relationship even breakdown between that relationship even breakdown between that relationship even a tiny little breakdown let's say it's a tiny little breakdown let's say it's a tiny little breakdown let's say it's supposed to the difference is 5 cents supposed to the difference is 5 cents supposed to the difference is 5 cents but now it goes to 10 cents well that but now it goes to 10 cents well that but now it goes to 10 cents well that doesn't seem like a lot it's a 5-cent doesn't seem like a lot it's a 5-cent doesn't seem like a lot it's a 5-cent difference but if you amplified it by 2 difference but if you amplified it by 2 difference but if you amplified it by 2 3 4 5, 000% because you've leveraged 3 4 5, 000% because you've leveraged 3 4 5, 000% because you've leveraged yourself out so much that now becomes a yourself out so much that now becomes a yourself out so much that now becomes a difference of $500 million against you difference of $500 million against you difference of $500 million against you versus $500 million for and of course versus $500 million for and of course versus $500 million for and of course systemic IC risk. If enough hedge funds systemic IC risk. If enough hedge funds systemic IC risk. If enough hedge funds are doing this trade and it goes wrong, are doing this trade and it goes wrong, are doing this trade and it goes wrong, they might all have to dump the assets they might all have to dump the assets they might all have to dump the assets at the same time and that will at the same time and that will at the same time and that will destabilize the market and all those destabilize the market and all those destabilize the market and all those prices will not will not coincide to prices will not will not coincide to prices will not will not coincide to have one analogy. So here's a simple have one analogy. So here's a simple have one analogy. So here's a simple analogy to make you understand for those analogy to make you understand for those analogy to make you understand for those that are not economically literate. You that are not economically literate. You that are not economically literate. You could say imagine you have a spot candy could say imagine you have a spot candy could say imagine you have a spot candy bar selling for a dollar in one store bar selling for a dollar in one store bar selling for a dollar in one store and a$15 in another. You think easy. and a$15 in another. You think easy. and a$15 in another. You think easy. I'll buy the first store and sell in the I'll buy the first store and sell in the I'll buy the first store and sell in the second and make five cents. But what if second and make five cents. But what if second and make five cents. But what if one store closes early, you borrowed one store closes early, you borrowed one store closes early, you borrowed money to buy a thousand bars and now you money to buy a thousand bars and now you money to buy a thousand bars and now you can't sell them because the other store can't sell them because the other store can't sell them because the other store is closed and the price in the second is closed and the price in the second is closed and the price in the second store suddenly drops. Now you're stuck store suddenly drops. Now you're stuck store suddenly drops. Now you're stuck and your small safe profit turns into a and your small safe profit turns into a and your small safe profit turns into a huge loss. Let me know if this makes huge loss. Let me know if this makes huge loss. Let me know if this makes sense to you and show you how this sense to you and show you how this sense to you and show you how this actually happened during 2020 um market actually happened during 2020 um market actually happened during 2020 um market meltdown. You see, even the most meltdown. You see, even the most meltdown. You see, even the most economically illiterate, someone who's economically illiterate, someone who's economically illiterate, someone who's completely ignorant, and someone who's completely ignorant, and someone who's completely ignorant, and someone who's not even interested in in economics of not even interested in in economics of not even interested in in economics of finance, could easily understand that if finance, could easily understand that if finance, could easily understand that if you buy a candy bar in one store, try to you buy a candy bar in one store, try to you buy a candy bar in one store, try to sell at another store, and the other sell at another store, and the other sell at another store, and the other store just simply isn't open for store just simply isn't open for store just simply isn't open for business, you're suddenly stuck with a business, you're suddenly stuck with a business, you're suddenly stuck with a thousand candy bars that you really thousand candy bars that you really thousand candy bars that you really don't want because you're not buying don't want because you're not buying don't want because you're not buying them for the candy bars. You're buying them for the candy bars. You're buying them for the candy bars. You're buying them at a difference in two prices. And them at a difference in two prices. And them at a difference in two prices. And it's a great great strategy when the it's a great great strategy when the it's a great great strategy when the markets are calm. But that is a strategy markets are calm. But that is a strategy markets are calm. But that is a strategy that can literally blow up the global that can literally blow up the global that can literally blow up the global financial system because it is practiced financial system because it is practiced financial system because it is practiced in such huge scope and such huge size by in such huge scope and such huge size by in such huge scope and such huge size by so many hedge funds precisely because it so many hedge funds precisely because it so many hedge funds precisely because it is deemed to be so safe and trustworthy is deemed to be so safe and trustworthy is deemed to be so safe and trustworthy most of the time. Now as a result of most of the time. Now as a result of most of the time. Now as a result of Chad GBT and its mentorship, you're kind Chad GBT and its mentorship, you're kind Chad GBT and its mentorship, you're kind of aware of what's going on. And of aware of what's going on. And of aware of what's going on. And whenever you hear that on the news, whenever you hear that on the news, whenever you hear that on the news, whenever you see the impact of that um whenever you see the impact of that um whenever you see the impact of that um in the news prices, you can begin to in the news prices, you can begin to in the news prices, you can begin to understand why it's such an important understand why it's such an important understand why it's such an important part of trading.

Please put all of this into a nice, neat Please put all of this into a nice, neat Please put all of this into a nice, neat tabular format so that I can have it for tabular format so that I can have it for tabular format so that I can have it for easy reading. Let's see what it will do easy reading. Let's see what it will do easy reading. Let's see what it will do for us. I just simply press the button for us. I just simply press the button for us. I just simply press the button and it's going to go out on the web, and it's going to go out on the web, and it's going to go out on the web, pull all this uh important technical pull all this uh important technical pull all this uh important technical data about gold for me and then data about gold for me and then data about gold for me and then hopefully collate it into something that hopefully collate it into something that hopefully collate it into something that I can use as a potential trade source of I can use as a potential trade source of I can use as a potential trade source of trade ideas. So here it is a nice neat trade ideas. So here it is a nice neat trade ideas. So here it is a nice neat tabular analysis of gold on a multi-time tabular analysis of gold on a multi-time tabular analysis of gold on a multi-time frame analysis giving us the exact frame analysis giving us the exact frame analysis giving us the exact readings of RSI, MACD, trend, key readings of RSI, MACD, trend, key readings of RSI, MACD, trend, key support and resistance levels and support and resistance levels and support and resistance levels and possible trade ideas. all of it in a possible trade ideas. all of it in a possible trade ideas. all of it in a nice neat little format that we can then nice neat little format that we can then nice neat little format that we can then extract and be able to um analyze extract and be able to um analyze extract and be able to um analyze ourselves. You can see over here that on ourselves. You can see over here that on ourselves. You can see over here that on the hourly it's kind of neutral. On the the hourly it's kind of neutral.
