Description:
好的，这是对提供的文本的总结，包括中文概要、核心结论、总体框架和Mermaid图：

**概要总结：**

该视频主要评测了Manis AI在两个任务上的表现：文献综述和软件移植。

*   **文献综述：**
    *   使用了ChatGPT-4.5辅助生成提示词，要求Manis AI进行文献检索、数据收集、表格制作、简单绘图和报告撰写。
    *   结果表明，Manis AI在文献检索的全面性方面表现不足，无法找到所有相关文献。
    *   表格中的数据有时不准确，图表不够完善。
    *   对找到的文献的解读较为准确，但整体而言，文献综述任务完成度较低。
*   **软件移植：**
    *   要求Manis AI将IDL语言编写的ATV软件移植到Python。
    *   Manis AI多次生成无法运行的版本，存在过度设计的问题。
    *   通过“金发姑娘解决方案”（Goldilock solution），即简化依赖关系，最终成功运行了简化版的ATV软件。
    *   与OpenAI的01 Preview模型相比，Manis AI最终生成的软件功能较少，界面不够直观。
*   **总体评价：**
    *   Manis AI具有潜力，但在信息检索的全面性和软件工程的实用性方面仍有提升空间。

**核心结论：**

尽管Manis AI展示了一定的能力，但其在信息检索的全面性和软件工程的实用性方面仍需改进，以实现更高效和可靠的应用。

**总体框架：**

1.  **引言：** 介绍Manis AI的功能和用途。
2.  **任务一：文献综述**
    *   任务描述和提示词设计。

for those of you who don't know ago for those of you who don't know Manis AI is a AI agent that can control Manis AI is a AI agent that can control Manis AI is a AI agent that can control a computer browse the web and pretty a computer browse the web and pretty a computer browse the web and pretty much do any task you can think of that much do any task you can think of that much do any task you can think of that can be done on a computer for the most can be done on a computer for the most can be done on a computer for the most part if you go to Manis's website you part if you go to Manis's website you part if you go to Manis's website you can see different use cases that you can can see different use cases that you can can see different use cases that you can click on and you can see a replay of the click on and you can see a replay of the click on and you can see a replay of the chat and the live feed of what Manis's chat and the live feed of what Manis's chat and the live feed of what Manis's computer was was showing at that time so computer was was showing at that time so computer was was showing at that time so if you go to my tab here you can see if you go to my tab here you can see if you go to my tab here you can see that I've used Manis for three different that I've used Manis for three different that I've used Manis for three different applications in the past few days and applications in the past few days and applications in the past few days and I'll talk a little bit about two of them I'll talk a little bit about two of them I'll talk a little bit about two of them because really the third one is very because really the third one is very because really the third one is very similar to one of the other ones and the similar to one of the other ones and the similar to one of the other ones and the two main tasks that I've asked it to two main tasks that I've asked it to two main tasks that I've asked it to work on are one making a research review work on are one making a research review work on are one making a research review or a literature review for the field of or a literature review for the field of or a literature review for the field of research that I did my PhD in which is a research that I did my PhD in which is a research that I did my PhD in which is a task that I've given to other models task that I've given to other models task that I've given to other models that have sort of deep research that have sort of deep research that have sort of deep research capabilities i'm talking about Gemini capabilities i'm talking about Gemini capabilities i'm talking about Gemini advanced deep research perplexity deep advanced deep research perplexity deep advanced deep research perplexity deep research as well as the OpenAI deep research as well as the OpenAI deep research as well as the OpenAI deep research model and so I wanted to see research model and so I wanted to see research model and so I wanted to see how Manis stacked up with those other how Manis stacked up with those other how Manis stacked up with those other researching models as as a researcher researching models as as a researcher researching models as as a researcher even though it is more broad in the even though it is more broad in the even though it is more broad in the sense that Manis can do more things than sense that Manis can do more things than sense that Manis can do more things than just research i also asked it to convert just research i also asked it to convert just research i also asked it to convert an old software program that's in an old software program that's in an old software program that's in another language into Python this is the another language into Python this is the another language into Python this is the software that I wanted it to recreate in software that I wanted it to recreate in software that I wanted it to recreate in Python this program known as ATV this is Python this program known as ATV this is Python this program known as ATV this is actually written by my PhD adviser when actually written by my PhD adviser when actually written by my PhD adviser when he was a graduate student which is crazy he was a graduate student which is crazy he was a graduate student which is crazy if you ask me but if you look at the if you ask me but if you look at the if you ask me but if you look at the source code here it's like 12, 000 or so source code here it's like 12, 000 or so source code here it's like 12, 000 or so lines and I wanted to see if Manis could lines and I wanted to see if Manis could lines and I wanted to see if Manis could take this code in a different language take this code in a different language take this code in a different language and essentially port it over to Python and essentially port it over to Python and essentially port it over to Python those of you who remember I actually those of you who remember I actually those of you who remember I actually asked Open AI's 01 preview model to do asked Open AI's 01 preview model to do asked Open AI's 01 preview model to do this about six months ago and I'll talk this about six months ago and I'll talk this about six months ago and I'll talk about how it did so let's go back and about how it did so let's go back and about how it did so let's go back and talk a little bit about the first task talk a little bit about the first task talk a little bit about the first task which was the research review so I asked which was the research review so I asked which was the research review so I asked Manis again to write a research review Manis again to write a research review Manis again to write a research review the prompt that I gave Manis AI for the the prompt that I gave Manis AI for the the prompt that I gave Manis AI for the research review was a prompt that I had research review was a prompt that I had research review was a prompt that I had Chad GBT4 and a half help me write so Chad GBT4 and a half help me write so Chad GBT4 and a half help me write so effectively I had a plan already of what effectively I had a plan already of what effectively I had a plan already of what I wanted it to do but I wanted to give I wanted it to do but I wanted to give I wanted it to do but I wanted to give Manis a prompt that was clear very Manis a prompt that was clear very Manis a prompt that was clear very understandable and in a way that it understandable and in a way that it understandable and in a way that it could take my instructions and go ahead could take my instructions and go ahead could take my instructions and go ahead and perform the task without that much and perform the task without that much and perform the task without that much of a problem so I gave an outline of my of a problem so I gave an outline of my of a problem so I gave an outline of my prompt to chat GBT4 and a half and I prompt to chat GBT4 and a half and I prompt to chat GBT4 and a half and I said "Hey I'm going to prompt an AI said "Hey I'm going to prompt an AI said "Hey I'm going to prompt an AI agent please take these thoughts that I agent please take these thoughts that I agent please take these thoughts that I have and come up with a prompt to prompt have and come up with a prompt to prompt have and come up with a prompt to prompt this AI agent to do the tasks that I this AI agent to do the tasks that I this AI agent to do the tasks that I want to do. " And this was the prompt want to do. " And this was the prompt want to do. " And this was the prompt that's a pretty good prompt and I think that's a pretty good prompt and I think that's a pretty good prompt and I think it's pretty clear as to what I wanted it it's pretty clear as to what I wanted it it's pretty clear as to what I wanted it to do i wanted to do a literature search to do i wanted to do a literature search to do i wanted to do a literature search i wanted to collect some data and put i wanted to collect some data and put i wanted to collect some data and put into a spreadsheet i wanted to make a into a spreadsheet i wanted to make a into a spreadsheet i wanted to make a simple plot and then I wanted to write a simple plot and then I wanted to write a simple plot and then I wanted to write a bit of a report okay so it's a very I bit of a report okay so it's a very I bit of a report okay so it's a very I think simple task that you would think simple task that you would think simple task that you would probably expect a college or graduate probably expect a college or graduate probably expect a college or graduate student to do basically without a student to do basically without a student to do basically without a problem it would just take a lot of time problem it would just take a lot of time problem it would just take a lot of time and this could save a lot of time and so and this could save a lot of time and so and this could save a lot of time and so Manis went off and did its thing so we Manis went off and did its thing so we Manis went off and did its thing so we can take a look and scroll through the can take a look and scroll through the can take a look and scroll through the different clips here but you can see it different clips here but you can see it different clips here but you can see it searching on uh the ads astrophysics uh searching on uh the ads astrophysics uh searching on uh the ads astrophysics uh data system which is a popular site to data system which is a popular site to data system which is a popular site to find papers you can see it making this find papers you can see it making this find papers you can see it making this CSV with this references and it's CSV with this references and it's CSV with this references and it's basically trying to find all the basically trying to find all the basically trying to find all the different relevant papers going through different relevant papers going through different relevant papers going through archive going through other journal archive going through other journal archive going through other journal websites and it's finding my papers websites and it's finding my papers websites and it's finding my papers which is kind of funny but the thing which is kind of funny but the thing which is kind of funny but the thing that I noticed about it as well as the that I noticed about it as well as the that I noticed about it as well as the other AI sort of deep research models is other AI sort of deep research models is other AI sort of deep research models is that none of these models can seem to that none of these models can seem to that none of these models can seem to get the comprehensive list and what I get the comprehensive list and what I get the comprehensive list and what I mean by that is that if you take a look mean by that is that if you take a look mean by that is that if you take a look at the uh final report that they come up at the uh final report that they come up at the uh final report that they come up with they always just stop short of with they always just stop short of with they always just stop short of finding all of the relevant sources like finding all of the relevant sources like finding all of the relevant sources like I asked it to find all the relevant I asked it to find all the relevant I asked it to find all the relevant sources since 2015 says it could only sources since 2015 says it could only sources since 2015 says it could only find seven but I know for a fact there's find seven but I know for a fact there's find seven but I know for a fact there's more than seven and again with Gemini more than seven and again with Gemini more than seven and again with Gemini deep research you can see that it's a deep research you can see that it's a deep research you can see that it's a bit more comprehensive but another thing bit more comprehensive but another thing bit more comprehensive but another thing that I found interesting as well is that that I found interesting as well is that that I found interesting as well is that they don't always get these reported they don't always get these reported they don't always get these reported values correct in the tables they create values correct in the tables they create values correct in the tables they create in fact Manis in its table got a few in fact Manis in its table got a few in fact Manis in its table got a few details incorrect in terms of the the details incorrect in terms of the the details incorrect in terms of the the parameters in this table it made here so parameters in this table it made here so parameters in this table it made here so that was kind of interesting if not uh that was kind of interesting if not uh that was kind of interesting if not uh maybe a little bit disappointing that maybe a little bit disappointing that maybe a little bit disappointing that one it's not comprehensive enough and one it's not comprehensive enough and one it's not comprehensive enough and two even when it tries to retrieve the two even when it tries to retrieve the two even when it tries to retrieve the information it doesn't do a perfect job information it doesn't do a perfect job information it doesn't do a perfect job at it and it did make a plot the plot at it and it did make a plot the plot at it and it did make a plot the plot doesn't really look that great because doesn't really look that great because doesn't really look that great because it's not well populated because it's it's not well populated because it's it's not well populated because it's missing a lot of data points but missing a lot of data points but missing a lot of data points but nevertheless a lot of the things that it nevertheless a lot of the things that it nevertheless a lot of the things that it writes in terms of the scientific writes in terms of the scientific writes in terms of the scientific information it's providing is accurate information it's providing is accurate information it's providing is accurate but again incomplete and so that's a but again incomplete and so that's a but again incomplete and so that's a little bit disappointing but it does little bit disappointing but it does little bit disappointing but it does give pretty good interpretations of what give pretty good interpretations of what give pretty good interpretations of what it does find and I think that if the it does find and I think that if the it does find and I think that if the retrieval was just a little bit better retrieval was just a little bit better retrieval was just a little bit better this could really automate the this could really automate the this could really automate the literature review process now if these literature review process now if these literature review process now if these AI models whether it's Manis or it's AI models whether it's Manis or it's AI models whether it's Manis or it's Gemini deep research perplexity open AI Gemini deep research perplexity open AI Gemini deep research perplexity open AI deep research if these models were deep research if these models were deep research if these models were really really intelligent what they really really intelligent what they really really intelligent what they could do is try and find my dissertation could do is try and find my dissertation could do is try and find my dissertation and just go to the back of the and just go to the back of the and just go to the back of the dissertation and find the list of all dissertation and find the list of all dissertation and find the list of all the references I was expecting them to the references I was expecting them to the references I was expecting them to find because I asked this question to find because I asked this question to find because I asked this question to all of the different LLMs that have all of the different LLMs that have all of the different LLMs that have reasoning this question of making a reasoning this question of making a reasoning this question of making a literature review with all the literature review with all the literature review with all the comprehensive sources because I did that comprehensive sources because I did that comprehensive sources because I did that and I know what the sources are of what and I know what the sources are of what and I know what the sources are of what they should be citing and every time they should be citing and every time they should be citing and every time they do it they just never make a list they do it they just never make a list they do it they just never make a list as comprehensive as this and so that's as comprehensive as this and so that's as comprehensive as this and so that's one thing I'm still looking forward to one thing I'm still looking forward to one thing I'm still looking forward to in terms of models that can really in terms of models that can really in terms of models that can really retrieve information in a comprehensive retrieve information in a comprehensive retrieve information in a comprehensive manner and not leave a lot of uh data manner and not leave a lot of uh data manner and not leave a lot of uh data points missing which doesn't matter if points missing which doesn't matter if points missing which doesn't matter if it was open AI's model Google's manness it was open AI's model Google's manness it was open AI's model Google's manness perplexity they all seem to to fall a perplexity they all seem to to fall a perplexity they all seem to to fall a little bit short in terms of finding all little bit short in terms of finding all little bit short in terms of finding all the sources when I'm asking it to do a the sources when I'm asking it to do a the sources when I'm asking it to do a proper comprehensive literature review proper comprehensive literature review proper comprehensive literature review so don't want to belabor the point too so don't want to belabor the point too so don't want to belabor the point too much overall I'd say on this task that much overall I'd say on this task that much overall I'd say on this task that it failed for the most part because it it failed for the most part because it it failed for the most part because it only found four references out of I was only found four references out of I was only found four references out of I was expecting around 30 but uh in terms of expecting around 30 but uh in terms of expecting around 30 but uh in terms of the sources that it did find it did do the sources that it did find it did do the sources that it did find it did do what I wanted to do so you know take it what I wanted to do so you know take it what I wanted to do so you know take it with a grain of salt if it was better at with a grain of salt if it was better at with a grain of salt if it was better at retrieving information I'm sure it could retrieving information I'm sure it could retrieving information I'm sure it could have made a report that talked about the have made a report that talked about the have made a report that talked about the sample as a whole and found all the sample as a whole and found all the sample as a whole and found all the different patterns and trends but it different patterns and trends but it different patterns and trends but it didn't do that but not trying to be too didn't do that but not trying to be too didn't do that but not trying to be too harsh but that's just how I saw it after harsh but that's just how I saw it after harsh but that's just how I saw it after this task was done okay let's talk about this task was done okay let's talk about this task was done okay let's talk about the second task that I asked it to do the second task that I asked it to do the second task that I asked it to do the second task that I asked Manis to do the second task that I asked Manis to do the second task that I asked Manis to do was to recreate a software program known was to recreate a software program known was to recreate a software program known as ATV in Python now ATV is this program as ATV in Python now ATV is this program as ATV in Python now ATV is this program that my PhD adviser wrote when he was a that my PhD adviser wrote when he was a that my PhD adviser wrote when he was a grad student and I mean that's just grad student and I mean that's just grad student and I mean that's just crazy i don't know how he did that but crazy i don't know how he did that but crazy i don't know how he did that but he did but it's in this language known he did but it's in this language known he did but it's in this language known as IDL it's a closed source environment as IDL it's a closed source environment as IDL it's a closed source environment and I've for a while thought about how and I've for a while thought about how and I've for a while thought about how nice it would be if this program could nice it would be if this program could nice it would be if this program could be ported to Python now some viewers of be ported to Python now some viewers of be ported to Python now some viewers of my channel may remember that I actually my channel may remember that I actually my channel may remember that I actually did give this prompt this task of did give this prompt this task of did give this prompt this task of converting ATV from IDL to Python to converting ATV from IDL to Python to converting ATV from IDL to Python to OpenAI preview back in like September OpenAI preview back in like September OpenAI preview back in like September and this is the result it came up with i and this is the result it came up with i and this is the result it came up with i made a whole video about that but how made a whole video about that but how made a whole video about that but how did Manis compare with the Open AI did Manis compare with the Open AI did Manis compare with the Open AI version well if we go to the chat here version well if we go to the chat here version well if we go to the chat here you'll notice that this chat is actually you'll notice that this chat is actually you'll notice that this chat is actually quite long because Mattis kept giving me quite long because Mattis kept giving me quite long because Mattis kept giving me versions of the program that just would versions of the program that just would versions of the program that just would not work and I always had to keep giving not work and I always had to keep giving not work and I always had to keep giving it back in terms of saying "Hey I tried it back in terms of saying "Hey I tried it back in terms of saying "Hey I tried to follow your instructions you know I to follow your instructions you know I to follow your instructions you know I read the read me i read the markdown but read the read me i read the markdown but read the read me i read the markdown but every time I try and set up the ATV every time I try and set up the ATV every time I try and set up the ATV environment on Python it just completely environment on Python it just completely environment on Python it just completely crashes. " And so I kept having to give crashes. " And so I kept having to give crashes. " And so I kept having to give it back and it was kind of funny because it back and it was kind of funny because it back and it was kind of funny because if you go to Manis's zip files it would if you go to Manis's zip files it would if you go to Manis's zip files it would always give me it starts here it it always give me it starts here it it always give me it starts here it it would say things like you know PIA ATV would say things like you know PIA ATV would say things like you know PIA ATV crossplatform PIA ATV you know package crossplatform PIA ATV you know package crossplatform PIA ATV you know package fixed fix 2 final verified i would fixed fix 2 final verified i would fixed fix 2 final verified i would always ask it to be like hey you know always ask it to be like hey you know always ask it to be like hey you know this is wrong please you know fix it this is wrong please you know fix it this is wrong please you know fix it again and it keep sending me updated zip again and it keep sending me updated zip again and it keep sending me updated zip files so when you ask it to do a coding files so when you ask it to do a coding files so when you ask it to do a coding task like this it'll often uh give you task like this it'll often uh give you task like this it'll often uh give you all the files in the form of a zip has all the files in the form of a zip has all the files in the form of a zip has it writes all these scripts in in Python it writes all these scripts in in Python it writes all these scripts in in Python like I asked it to but it could just like I asked it to but it could just like I asked it to but it could just never get it to run properly because I never get it to run properly because I never get it to run properly because I would always try and start it on my own would always try and start it on my own would always try and start it on my own laptop and I would always just crash laptop and I would always just crash laptop and I would always just crash when I tried to open the software in when I tried to open the software in when I tried to open the software in terms of it has an executable binary and terms of it has an executable binary and terms of it has an executable binary and I just I couldn't just click it and open I just I couldn't just click it and open I just I couldn't just click it and open so that was really annoying and the one so that was really annoying and the one so that was really annoying and the one thing that I found to be really funny thing that I found to be really funny thing that I found to be really funny was that I talked to someone today about was that I talked to someone today about was that I talked to someone today about having this issue with AIS and coding having this issue with AIS and coding having this issue with AIS and coding and when they when they just seem to and when they when they just seem to and when they when they just seem to overengineer the problem where they they overengineer the problem where they they overengineer the problem where they they give you something like this where give you something like this where give you something like this where there's so many just dependencies and there's so many just dependencies and there's so many just dependencies and it's a really you know complex system i it's a really you know complex system i it's a really you know complex system i got to the point where I was like this got to the point where I was like this got to the point where I was like this is just too much to debug it just it is just too much to debug it just it is just too much to debug it just it just couldn't seem to fix all of the just couldn't seem to fix all of the just couldn't seem to fix all of the problems you can see here I'm asking hey problems you can see here I'm asking hey problems you can see here I'm asking hey you know when I try to launch it I get you know when I try to launch it I get you know when I try to launch it I get this error you know can you please you this error you know can you please you this error you know can you please you know fix it and then it says oh yeah I know fix it and then it says oh yeah I know fix it and then it says oh yeah I understand that you have this error you understand that you have this error you understand that you have this error you can see here this is one of the times can see here this is one of the times can see here this is one of the times where I said hey you know I couldn't get where I said hey you know I couldn't get where I said hey you know I couldn't get this thing to work when I tried to this thing to work when I tried to this thing to work when I tried to launch it on my computer refine the code launch it on my computer refine the code launch it on my computer refine the code to make sure that the executable is is to make sure that the executable is is to make sure that the executable is is openable on my computer here and it says openable on my computer here and it says openable on my computer here and it says okay understand let me try and fix it okay understand let me try and fix it okay understand let me try and fix it and then we kind of just kept going back and then we kind of just kept going back and then we kind of just kept going back and forth where it gives me these and forth where it gives me these and forth where it gives me these instructions where I could run the instructions where I could run the instructions where I could run the Python uh setup but whenever I tried to Python uh setup but whenever I tried to Python uh setup but whenever I tried to launch it would just crash and I kept launch it would just crash and I kept launch it would just crash and I kept saying oh you know here's the error saying oh you know here's the error saying oh you know here's the error message it doesn't seem to work and it message it doesn't seem to work and it message it doesn't seem to work and it says thank you for writing the error says thank you for writing the error says thank you for writing the error message this is the reason why let me message this is the reason why let me message this is the reason why let me fix that it would fix it supposedly and fix that it would fix it supposedly and fix that it would fix it supposedly and then I would come back and say hey then I would come back and say hey then I would come back and say hey there's still another error and we kept there's still another error and we kept there's still another error and we kept going back and forth and back and forth going back and forth and back and forth going back and forth and back and forth and eventually it got to the point where and eventually it got to the point where and eventually it got to the point where I just said "Okay forget it. " like it's I just said "Okay forget it. " like it's I just said "Okay forget it. " like it's just it seems like this is just too just it seems like this is just too just it seems like this is just too interconnected too interdependent that I interconnected too interdependent that I interconnected too interdependent that I cannot seem to work with it but I did cannot seem to work with it but I did cannot seem to work with it but I did talk to someone today about hey when you talk to someone today about hey when you talk to someone today about hey when you have an issue with LLMs like this that have an issue with LLMs like this that have an issue with LLMs like this that are trying to code something for you are trying to code something for you are trying to code something for you what you should do is say hey come up what you should do is say hey come up what you should do is say hey come up with the Goldilock solution don't with the Goldilock solution don't with the Goldilock solution don't overengineer it make something that you overengineer it make something that you overengineer it make something that you can easily verify that it works and it's can easily verify that it works and it's can easily verify that it works and it's not too complicated so this is how I not too complicated so this is how I not too complicated so this is how I phrased it here i just said "Oh you know phrased it here i just said "Oh you know phrased it here i just said "Oh you know it seems to fail because of the complex it seems to fail because of the complex it seems to fail because of the complex dependencies uh it's overengineered find dependencies uh it's overengineered find dependencies uh it's overengineered find the balanced goldilock solution that the balanced goldilock solution that the balanced goldilock solution that simplifies these dependencies without simplifies these dependencies without simplifies these dependencies without sacrificing essential functionality. " sacrificing essential functionality. " sacrificing essential functionality. " And only after this was I actually able And only after this was I actually able And only after this was I actually able to get it to work here so this was the to get it to work here so this was the to get it to work here so this was the last time I prompted it it gave me some last time I prompted it it gave me some last time I prompted it it gave me some instructions here as to how to do it so instructions here as to how to do it so instructions here as to how to do it so I'm going to run python setup. py like it I'm going to run python setup. py like it I'm going to run python setup. py like it says here so it's able to install all says here so it's able to install all says here so it's able to install all the the different dependencies and it the the different dependencies and it the the different dependencies and it just says launch i think I just do launchpatv. sh and okay so it does end up launchpatv. sh and okay so it does end up launchpatv. sh and okay so it does end up bringing up this graphical user bringing up this graphical user bringing up this graphical user interface how good is it actually in interface how good is it actually in interface how good is it actually in terms of reading fitz files those are terms of reading fitz files those are terms of reading fitz files those are the standard astronomy files well okay the standard astronomy files well okay the standard astronomy files well okay so I try to put in this mask file and so I try to put in this mask file and so I try to put in this mask file and okay it looks pretty good for the most okay it looks pretty good for the most okay it looks pretty good for the most part in terms of what my PhD advisor part in terms of what my PhD advisor part in terms of what my PhD advisor software can do it can do a lot more software can do it can do a lot more software can do it can do a lot more than what this you know very bare bones than what this you know very bare bones than what this you know very bare bones program does you can change the color program does you can change the color program does you can change the color map but you every time I change it there map but you every time I change it there map but you every time I change it there ends up being a new color bar and I ends up being a new color bar and I ends up being a new color bar and I never figured out how do you how do you never figured out how do you how do you never figured out how do you how do you get rid of this uh I can't seem to go get rid of this uh I can't seem to go get rid of this uh I can't seem to go back even though it says I should be back even though it says I should be back even though it says I should be able to go back you can change the able to go back you can change the able to go back you can change the scaling of the the image here the log scaling of the the image here the log scaling of the the image here the log scale square root it's getting smaller scale square root it's getting smaller scale square root it's getting smaller and smaller every time that I I try and and smaller every time that I I try and and smaller every time that I I try and do something so if you do zoom to fit uh do something so if you do zoom to fit uh do something so if you do zoom to fit uh can't zoom to can't zoom to can't zoom to zoom can I center i guess not can I zoom can I center i guess not can I zoom can I center i guess not can I autoscale okay I guess that did autoscale okay I guess that did autoscale okay I guess that did something so as you can see here it's something so as you can see here it's something so as you can see here it's not the most intuitive and it's kind of not the most intuitive and it's kind of not the most intuitive and it's kind of buggy I would say but at least it opened buggy I would say but at least it opened buggy I would say but at least it opened up and ran in the sense that it was up and ran in the sense that it was up and ran in the sense that it was something that I couldn't even do in the something that I couldn't even do in the something that I couldn't even do in the earlier versions i found it funny too earlier versions i found it funny too earlier versions i found it funny too just the naming convention of the of the just the naming convention of the of the just the naming convention of the of the packages in the sense that it would say packages in the sense that it would say packages in the sense that it would say you know fixed fix final verified it's you know fixed fix final verified it's you know fixed fix final verified it's

Manis AI didn't quite get it how did the Manis AI didn't quite get it how did the Manis AI didn't quite get it how did the Manis Goldilock solution compare with Manis Goldilock solution compare with Manis Goldilock solution compare with Chat GPT01 previews version from about 6 Chat GPT01 previews version from about 6 Chat GPT01 previews version from about 6 months ago so I went ahead and took the months ago so I went ahead and took the months ago so I went ahead and took the response from 01 preview which is all response from 01 preview which is all response from 01 preview which is all the way down here and let's just remind the way down here and let's just remind the way down here and let's just remind ourselves how that looked like so I ourselves how that looked like so I ourselves how that looked like so I believe I just do Python Python TV pi believe I just do Python Python TV pi believe I just do Python Python TV pi and this was the 01 preview solution and this was the 01 preview solution and this was the 01 preview solution okay so maybe not as many features as okay so maybe not as many features as okay so maybe not as many features as the as the manis version but if we go the as the manis version but if we go the as the manis version but if we go ahead and maybe find a file like this to ahead and maybe find a file like this to ahead and maybe find a file like this to look at again so I can actually you know look at again so I can actually you know look at again so I can actually you know pen i can uh can I change a color bar pen i can uh can I change a color bar pen i can uh can I change a color bar here there's no real color bar here here there's no real color bar here here there's no real color bar here actually can I change the map i can actually can I change the map i can actually can I change the map i can change the map okay but I don't I don't change the map okay but I don't I don't change the map okay but I don't I don't actually see the values of it can I actually see the values of it can I actually see the values of it can I change the the stretch i don't really change the the stretch i don't really change the the stretch i don't really see how the stretch can change because I see how the stretch can change because I see how the stretch can change because I can't see can't see can't see anything anything anything 704 1521 and a 10 aperture radius and 704 1521 and a 10 aperture radius and 704 1521 and a 10 aperture radius and the sum is actually 370 okay that's the sum is actually 370 okay that's the sum is actually 370 okay that's reasonable because all this is actually reasonable because all this is actually reasonable because all this is actually one value so I would say minus the fact one value so I would say minus the fact one value so I would say minus the fact that I can't see anything on this uh that I can't see anything on this uh that I can't see anything on this uh color bar there's no color bar scale color bar there's no color bar scale color bar there's no color bar scale here I would argue that the 01 preview here I would argue that the 01 preview here I would argue that the 01 preview version has a bit more functionality to version has a bit more functionality to version has a bit more functionality to it and is just more intuitive I think as it and is just more intuitive I think as it and is just more intuitive I think as a viewer um ultimately again I want it a viewer um ultimately again I want it a viewer um ultimately again I want it to be better than this you know I'd hope to be better than this you know I'd hope to be better than this you know I'd hope an AI agent one day can make something an AI agent one day can make something an AI agent one day can make something better than what either 01 preview or better than what either 01 preview or better than what either 01 preview or Manis was able to come up with but Manis was able to come up with but Manis was able to come up with but nevertheless I think overall my initial nevertheless I think overall my initial nevertheless I think overall my initial impressions with Manis are that I think impressions with Manis are that I think impressions with Manis are that I think it has a lot of potential and I it has a lot of potential and I it has a lot of potential and I obviously haven't tried that many things obviously haven't tried that many things obviously haven't tried that many things to do with it yet so I'm still coming up to do with it yet so I'm still coming up to do with it yet so I'm still coming up with use cases and I'm kind of burning with use cases and I'm kind of burning with use cases and I'm kind of burning through my credits quickly so I can't be through my credits quickly so I can't be through my credits quickly so I can't be too exploratory with it but nevertheless too exploratory with it but nevertheless too exploratory with it but nevertheless good start i think I think it rightfully good start i think I think it rightfully good start i think I think it rightfully shocked a lot of people what it could do shocked a lot of people what it could do shocked a lot of people what it could do the use cases speak for itself though I the use cases speak for itself though I the use cases speak for itself though I think we have to acknowledge the fact think we have to acknowledge the fact think we have to acknowledge the fact that when it comes to like retrieval and that when it comes to like retrieval and that when it comes to like retrieval and doing literature review research it's doing literature review research it's doing literature review research it's missing out on some of the comprehensive missing out on some of the comprehensive missing out on some of the comprehensive parts of it the Python parts of it the Python parts of it the Python stuff maybe not the best software stuff maybe not the best software stuff maybe not the best software engineer quite yet in the sense of engineer quite yet in the sense of engineer quite yet in the sense of building things that are just not uh building things that are just not uh building things that are just not uh launching on the first on the first try launching on the first on the first try launching on the first on the first try but overall I'm excited to keep playing but overall I'm excited to keep playing but overall I'm excited to keep playing with it and other AI agents that come with it and other AI agents that come with it and other AI agents that come out i hope you enjoyed watching this out i hope you enjoyed watching this out i hope you enjoyed watching this video and I hope it gave you a sense as video and I hope it gave you a sense as video and I hope it gave you a sense as to what Madness can do for you and again to what Madness can do for you and again to what Madness can do for you and again I'll be sharing the the chat as well as I'll be sharing the the chat as well as I'll be sharing the the chat as well as the replay that you can watch and see the replay that you can watch and see the replay that you can watch and see for yourself in more detail if you want for yourself in more detail if you want for yourself in more detail if you want to pause and and see things that it did to pause and and see things that it did to pause and and see things that it did during my sessions so with that thank during my sessions so with that thank during my sessions so with that thank you for watching i hope um you enjoyed you for watching i hope um you enjoyed you for
