Description:
好的，我将按照要求对提供的文本进行总结。

**核心观点:**

通过结合定制咨询、产品化服务和软件即服务(SaaS)这三种策略，即使没有技术背景，也能在人工智能领域获得短期利润，并为长期增长和退出机会做好准备。

**整体框架:**

该内容围绕如何在人工智能(AI)和自动化领域赚钱展开，提出了三种主要的商业模式，并分析了它们的优缺点，最后强调了将这三种模式结合起来的策略优势。

**概要:**

I. **引言:**

   *   指出当前在线赚钱的信息混乱和不透明。
   *   作者分享自己过去24个月使用AI和无代码工具的经验。
   *   承诺揭示如何在AI领域赚钱，即使没有技术经验。

II. **三种主要的盈利策略:**

   *   A. 定制咨询 (Bespoke Consulting): 为单个企业构建定制工作流程和自动化。
   *   B. 产品化服务 (Productized Services): 创建可服务于多个组织的标准化产品。
   *   C. 软件即服务 (SaaS): 可扩展的软件产品。

III. **评估标准:**

   *   结果确定性
   *   短期利润优化
   *   技术专业知识需求
   *   被动收入潜力
   *   八位数增长潜力

IV. **前提条件:**

   *   强调技术背景不是必须的。
   *   所需技能：设计逻辑系统、理解技术生态系统、基本商业原则、动力。
   *   指出当前价值在于逻辑设计而非编写代码。

V. **策略详解:**

   *   A. 定制咨询:
        *   找到需要简化和增长的业务。
        *   自动化已经产生收入的手动流程。
        *   通过构建客户软件解决方案立即实现产品市场匹配。
        *   销售技巧：建立融洽关系、展示项目组合、发现业务问题并提出解决方案。
        *   通常以按月收费方式运营，而不是单一项目。

   *   B. 产品化服务:
        *   创建可以为多个客户提供服务的单一产品。
        *   仍然可以做客制化设定。
        *   举例：设计精美，高互动表单

   *   C. SaaS:
        *   传统的SaaS模式风险高，因为很难适配客户需求。
        *   建议：通过定制咨询验证想法，然后将成功的工作流程转化为产品化服务，最终转化为SaaS产品。
        *   避免产品和市场不匹配的风险，同时可以实现现金流。

VI. **核心策略:**

   *   从定制咨询开始，积累现金、建立人脉、获取市场洞察力。
   *   然后根据咨询经验，选择合适的增长方向。

VII. **个人辅导:**

   *   提供一对一的AI和自动化咨询辅导。
   *   强调选择性，只与特定类型的人合作。

VIII. **结论:**

   *   鼓励读者发表评论和分享想法。

to all of this in a moment but first I think of this in a moment but first I think of this in a moment but first I think it's just really important that you guys it's just really important that you

notice how I $5, 000 retainer and notice how I mentioned that we usually work on a mentioned that we usually work on a mentioned that we usually work on a retainer basis instead of a project retainer basis instead of a project retainer basis instead of a project that's because the nature of building that's because the nature of building that's because the nature of building Tech just constantly sort of begets more Tech just constantly sort of begets more Tech just constantly sort of begets more once we Implement a workflow our clients once we Implement a workflow our clients once we Implement a workflow our clients will usually turn around and ask if we will usually turn around and ask if we will usually turn around and ask if we can add more features on top of what we can add

that they canate building this model is that they canate building this model is that they canate building automations with doing deep technical automations with doing deep technical automations with doing deep technical work and even though yes we are building work and even though yes we are building work and even though yes we are building custom software the people who generally custom software the people who generally custom software the people who generally make the most money doing this aren't make the most money doing this aren't make the most money doing this aren't often technical at

figureure run rate with Outsourcing figureure run rate with Outsourcing isn't all that challenging but getting isn't all that challenging but getting isn't all that challenging but getting to eight figures from there becomes a to eight figures from there becomes a to eight figures from there becomes a game of Staffing which has higher game of Staffing which has higher game of Staffing which has higher execution risk so as far as the longtail execution risk so as far as the longtail execution risk so as far as the longtail opportunity goes we are going to give opportunity goes we are going to

organizations now in this serve multiple organizations now in this framework we're still going to be framework we're still going to be framework we're still going to be building some custom Tech and building some custom Tech and building some custom Tech and personalization for each client that we personalization for each client that we personalization for each client that we onboard but the bulk of the work is onboard but the bulk of the work is onboard but the bulk of the work is going to be pretty copy and paste I'll going to be pretty copy and paste I'll going to be pretty copy and paste I'll show you guys quickly just like a little show you guys quickly just like a little show you guys quickly just like a little exclusive sneak peek of a couple product exclusive sneak peek of a couple product exclusive sneak peek of a couple product I services that I'm actively working on I services that I'm actively working on I services that I'm actively working on right now so one of the things that we right now so one of the things that we right now so one of the things that we do for our consultant clients all the do for our consultant clients all the do for our consultant clients all the time is build these data capturing time is build these data capturing time is build these data capturing workflows we watch for when someone workflows we watch for when someone workflows we watch for when someone fills out a Google form or a type form fills out a Google form or a type form fills out a Google form or a type form and then we'll take that info and pass and then we'll take that info and pass and then we'll take that info and pass it into open AI to create personalized it into open AI to create personalized it into open AI to create personalized outbound messages or we'll notify outbound messages or we'll notify outbound messages or we'll notify someone in slack or trigger an agent someone in slack or trigger an agent someone in slack or trigger an agent that does customer support whatever you that does customer support whatever you that does customer support whatever you get it but I tend to find that the forms get it but I tend to find that the forms get it but I tend to find that the forms are just often so ugly and they really are just often so ugly and they really are just often so ugly and they really do a poor job of gamification which do a poor job of gamification which do a poor job of gamification which costs a businesses funnel real dollars costs a businesses funnel real dollars costs a businesses funnel real dollars so what this product I service basically so what this product I service basically so what this product I service basically allows us to do is build totally allows us to do is build totally allows us to do is build totally personalized highly gamified forms that personalized highly gamified forms that personalized highly gamified forms that can be designed in any way per our can be designed in any way per our can be designed in any way per our client specifications this product is client specifications this product is client specifications this product is way too early for me to be doing like a way too early for me to be doing like a way too early for me to be doing like a proper demo just because the whole value proper demo just because the whole value proper demo just because the whole value proposition is that the forums look proposition is that the forums look proposition is that the forums look amazing and I haven't prioritized amazing and I haven't prioritized amazing and I haven't prioritized designing those yet because I just designing those yet because I just designing those yet because I just wanted to get all the backend stuff wanted to get all the backend stuff wanted to get all the backend stuff working first but hopefully you guys working first but hopefully you guys working first but hopefully you guys kind of get the point here with this kind of get the point here with this kind of get the point here with this product we can personalize it to the product we can personalize it to the product we can personalize it to the needs of whatever clients were on needs of whatever clients were on needs of whatever clients were on boarding but otherwise all of the boarding but otherwise all of the boarding but otherwise all of the structural stuff is just copy and paste structural stuff is just copy and paste structural stuff is just copy and paste and it's solved for and highly and it's solved for and highly and it's solved for and highly transferable so with this model the transferable so with this model the transferable so with this model the semi- bespoke nature gives us semi- bespoke nature gives us semi- bespoke nature gives us flexibility to bend towards our clients flexibility to bend towards our clients flexibility to bend towards our clients needs which makes these only slightly needs which makes these only slightly needs which makes these only slightly more challenging to sell than Consulting more challenging to sell than Consulting more challenging to sell than Consulting deals so we'll give certainty to Stars deals so we'll give certainty to Stars deals so we'll give certainty to Stars these products are highly profitable but these products are highly profitable but these products are highly profitable but take a little bit more
