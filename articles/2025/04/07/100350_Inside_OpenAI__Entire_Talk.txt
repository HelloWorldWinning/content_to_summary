quick question on the technology which quick question on the technology which is just the key technology underlying is just the key technology underlying is just the key technology underlying open Ai and generative AI more broadly open Ai and generative AI more broadly open Ai and generative AI more broadly is large language models can you is large language models can you is large language models can you describe the technology in simple terms describe the technology in simple terms describe the technology in simple terms and now that you're at the Forefront of and now that you're at the Forefront of and now that you're at the Forefront of the tech can you share would have the tech can you share would have the tech can you share would have surprised you the most about what the surprised you the most about what the surprised you the most about what the tech can do that you didn't anticipate tech can do that you didn't anticipate tech can do that you didn't anticipate yeah yeah yeah I I can't explain I I can't explain I I can't explain well this technology is and why it works I think the explanation for why it works I think the explanation for why it works I think the explanation for why it works is both simple and extremely beautiful is both simple and extremely beautiful is both simple and extremely beautiful and it works for the following reason so you know how so you know how so you know how the human brain is our best example of the human brain is our best example of the human brain is our best example of intelligence intelligence intelligence in in the world in in the world in in the world and we know that the human brain is made and we know that the human brain is made and we know that the human brain is made out of a large number of neurons a very out of a large number of neurons a very out of a large number of neurons a very very large number of neurons very large number of neurons very large number of neurons neuroscientists have studied neurons for neuroscientists have studied neurons for neuroscientists have studied neurons for many decades to try to understand how many decades to try to understand how many decades to try to understand how they work precisely and while the they work precisely and while the they work precisely and while the operation of our biological neurons are operation of our biological neurons are operation of our biological neurons are still mysterious still mysterious still mysterious there's been a pretty bold conjecture there's been a pretty bold conjecture there's been a pretty bold conjecture made by the earliest deep learning made by the earliest deep learning made by the earliest deep learning researchers in the 40s researchers in the 40s researchers in the 40s the idea that an artificial neuron the idea that an artificial neuron the idea that an artificial neuron the ones that we have in our artificial the ones that we have in our artificial the ones that we have in our artificial neural networks kind of sort of similar neural networks kind of sort of similar neural networks kind of sort of similar to a biological neuron if you squint so to a biological neuron if you squint so to a biological neuron if you squint so that's there's an assumption there that's there's an assumption there that's there's an assumption there and we can just run with this assumption and we can just run with this assumption and we can just run with this assumption now one of the nice things about these now one of the nice things about these now one of the nice things about these artificial neurons is that you can artificial neurons is that you can artificial neurons is that you can they are much simpler and you can study they are much simpler and you can study they are much simpler and you can study them mathematically them mathematically them mathematically and a very important breakthrough that and a very important breakthrough that and a very important breakthrough that was done by the very very early deep was done by the very very early deep was done by the very very early deep learning Pioneers before it was known as learning Pioneers before it was known as learning Pioneers before it was known as deep learning was the discovery of the deep learning was the discovery of the deep learning was the discovery of the back propagation algorithm back propagation algorithm back propagation algorithm which is a mathematical equation for how which is a mathematical equation for how which is a mathematical equation for how these artificial neural networks should these artificial neural networks should these artificial neural networks should learn learn learn it it it provides us with a way of provides us with a way of provides us with a way of taking a large computer taking a large computer taking a large computer and implementing this neural network in and implementing this neural network in and implementing this neural network in code and then there would be there is an code and then there would be there is an code and then there would be there is an equation that we can code up that tells equation that we can code up that tells equation that we can code up that tells us how this neural network should adapt us how this neural network should adapt us how this neural network should adapt its connections to learn from experience its connections to learn from experience its connections to learn from experience now a lot of additional further progress now a lot of additional further progress now a lot of additional further progress had to do with understanding just how had to do with understanding just how had to do with understanding just how good and how capable this learning good and how capable this learning good and how capable this learning procedure is procedure is procedure is and what are the exact conditions under and what are the exact conditions under and what are the exact conditions under which this learning procedure works well which this learning procedure works well which this learning procedure works well it's although this is although we do it's although this is although we do it's although this is although we do with computers it was a little bit of an with computers it was a little bit of an with computers it was a little bit of an experimental science a little bit like experimental science a little bit like experimental science a little bit like biology where you have something that is biology where you have something that is biology where you have something that is you know like like like a local you know like like like a local you know like like like a local biological experiment a little bit biological experiment a little bit biological experiment a little bit and and and so then a lot of the progress with deep so then a lot of the progress with deep so then a lot of the progress with deep learning basically boils down to this learning basically boils down to this learning basically boils down to this we can build these neural networks in we can build these neural networks in we can build these neural networks in our large computers and we can train our large computers and we can train our large computers and we can train them on some data we can train those them on some data we can train those them on some data we can train those large neural networks to do whatever it large neural networks to do whatever it large neural networks to do whatever it is that the data asks them to do is that the data asks them to do is that the data asks them to do now the idea of a large language model now the idea of a large language model now the idea of a large language model is that if you have a very large neural is that if you have a very large neural is that if you have a very large neural network network network perhaps one that's now not that far from perhaps one that's now not that far from perhaps one that's now not that far from like these neural networks are pretty like these neural networks are pretty like these neural networks are pretty large large large and we train them on the task and we train them on the task and we train them on the task to guess the next word from a bunch of to guess the next word from a bunch of to guess the next word from a bunch of previous words previous words previous words in text in text in text so this is the idea of a large language so this is the idea of a large language so this is the idea of a large language model you train a big neural network to model you train a big neural network to model you train a big neural network to guess the next word from a previous from guess the next word from a previous from guess the next word from a previous from the previous words in text and you want the previous words in text and you want the previous words in text and you want the neural network to guess the next the neural network to guess the next the neural network to guess the next word as accurately as possible now the thing that happens here is we now the thing that happens here is we now the thing that happens here is we need to come back to our original need to come back to our original need to come back to our original assumption that maybe biological neurons assumption that maybe biological neurons assumption that maybe biological neurons aren't that different from artificial aren't that different from artificial aren't that different from artificial neurons and so if you have a large neurons and so if you have a large neurons and so if you have a large neural network like this that guesses neural network like this that guesses neural network like this that guesses the next word really well maybe it will the next word really well maybe it will the next word really well maybe it will be not that different from what people be not that different from what people be not that different from what people do when they speak and that's what you do when they speak and that's what you do when they speak and that's what you get so now when you talk to get so now when you talk to get so now when you talk to a neural network like this it's because a neural network like this it's because a neural network like this it's because it has such a great such an excellent it has such a great such an excellent it has such a great such an excellent sense of what comes next what word comes sense of what comes next what word comes sense of what comes next what word comes next it can narrow down it can't see the next it can narrow down it can't see the next it can narrow down it can't see the future but it can narrow down the future but it can narrow down the future but it can narrow down the possibilities correctly from its possibilities correctly from its possibilities correctly from its understanding understanding understanding being able to guess what comes next very being able to guess what comes next very being able to guess what comes next very very accurately requires prediction very accurately requires prediction very accurately requires prediction which is the way you operationalize which is the way you operationalize which is the way you operationalize understanding understanding understanding what does it mean for a neural network what does it mean for a neural network what does it mean for a neural network to understand it's hard to come up with to understand it's hard to come up with to understand it's hard to come up with a clean answer but it is very easy to a clean answer but it is very easy to a clean answer but it is very easy to measure and optimize the Network's measure and optimize the Network's measure and optimize the Network's prediction error of the next word prediction error of the next word prediction error of the next word so we say we want understanding but we so we say we want understanding but we so we say we want understanding but we can optimize prediction and that's what can optimize prediction and that's what can optimize prediction and that's what we do we do we do and that's how you get this current and that's how you get this current and that's how you get this current large language models these are neural large language models these are neural large language models these are neural networks which are large they are networks which are large they are networks which are large they are trained with the back propagation trained with the back propagation trained with the back propagation algorithm which is very capable and if algorithm which is very capable and if algorithm which is very capable and if you allow yourself to imagine that an you allow yourself to imagine that an you allow yourself to imagine that an artificial neuron is not that different artificial neuron is not that different artificial neuron is not that different from a biological neuron then yeah like from a biological neuron then yeah like from a biological neuron then yeah like our brains are doing are capable of our brains are doing are capable of our brains are doing are capable of doing a pretty good job at guessing the doing a pretty good job at guessing the doing a pretty good job at guessing the next word if you pay if you pay very next word if you pay if you pay very next word if you pay if you pay very close attention close attention close attention so so if I let I love that and I just so so if I let I love that and I just so so if I let I love that and I just want to make this more concrete so just want to make this more concrete so just want to make this more concrete so just to push that analogy further between the to push that analogy further between the to push that analogy further between the biological brain and these neural um uh biological brain and these neural um uh

for these machines to learn now it's a for these machines to learn now it's a for these machines to learn now it's a given that they can learn or do this given that they can learn or do this given

gbt models into the most recent chat gbt models into the most recent chat gbt models what would you put the most recent chat what would you put the most recent chat what would you put the most recent chat gbt model as a ratio of where the humans gbt model as a ratio of where the humans gbt model as a ratio of where the humans are at so if humans are at 1X what's are at so if humans are at 1X what's are at so if humans are at 1X what's chat gpdn chat gpdn chat gpdn you know it's a bit hard to make direct you know it's a bit hard to make direct you know it's a bit hard to make direct comparisons between our artificial comparisons between our artificial comparisons between our artificial neural networks and people because at neural networks and people because at neural networks and people because at present people people people are able are able are able to learn more from a lot less data to learn more from a lot less data to learn more from a lot less data this is why these neural networks like this is why these neural networks like this is why these neural networks like Chad GPT are trained on so much data to Chad GPT are trained on so much data to Chad GPT are trained on so much data to compensate for their initial slow compensate for their initial slow compensate for their initial slow learning ability learning ability learning ability you know as we train these neural you know as we train these neural you know as we train these neural networks and we make them better networks and we make them better networks and we make them better faster learning abilities start to faster learning abilities start to faster learning abilities start to emerge emerge emerge but overall overall it is the case that we are we overall it is the case that we are we overall it is the case that we are we are quite different the way people learn are quite different the way people learn are quite different the way people learn is quite different from the way these is quite different from the way these is quite different from the way these neural networks learn like one example neural networks learn like one example neural networks learn like one example might be you know these neural networks might be you know these neural networks might be you know these neural networks they are they are they are you know solidly good at math or you know solidly good at math or you know solidly good at math or programming programming programming but like the amount of math books they but like the amount of math books they but like the amount of math books they needed to get let's say good at needed to get let's say good at needed to get let's say good at something like something like something like calculus is very high or as a person calculus is very high or as a person calculus is very high or as a person would need a fairly you know two would need a fairly you know two would need a fairly you know two textbooks and maybe 200 exercises and textbooks and maybe 200 exercises and textbooks and maybe 200 exercises and you're pretty pretty much good to go you're pretty pretty much good to go you're pretty pretty much good to go so there is just to get an order of so there is just to get an order of so there is just to get an order of magnitude sense if you relax the data magnitude sense if you relax the data magnitude sense if you relax the data constraint so if you let the machine constraint so if you let the machine constraint so if you let the machine consume as much data as it needs do you consume as much data as it needs do you consume as much data as it needs do you think it's operating at like one-tenth think it's operating at like one-tenth think it's operating at like one-tenth of a human right now or of a human right now or of a human right now or you know it's quite hard to answer that you know it's quite hard to answer that you know it's quite hard to answer that question still and let me tell you why I question still and let me tell you why I question still and let me tell you why I hesitate to like I think that any figure hesitate to like I think that any figure hesitate to like I think that any figure like this will be misleading and I want like this will be misleading and I want like this will be misleading and I want to explain why like because right now to explain why like because right now to explain why like because right now any such neural network is obviously any such neural network is obviously any such neural network is obviously very superhuman when it comes to the very superhuman when it comes to the very superhuman when it comes to the breadth of its knowledge and to the very breadth of its knowledge and to the very breadth of its knowledge and to the very large number of skills that these neural large number of skills that these neural large number of skills that these neural networks have for example they're very networks have for example they're very networks have for example they're very good at poetry and they're very good you good at poetry and they're very good you good at poetry and they're very good you know like they can talk eloquently about know like they can talk eloquently about know like they can talk eloquently about any topic pretty much any topic pretty much any topic pretty much and they can talk about historical and they can talk about historical and they can talk about historical events and lots of things like this events and lots of things like this events and lots of things like this on the other hand on the other hand on the other hand on the

despite having read only a small amount despite having read only a small amount despite having read only a small amount of documents let's say on the topic so of documents let's say on the topic so of documents let's say on the topic so because of this difference I really because of this difference I really because of this difference I really hesitated to answer the question in hesitated to answer the question in hesitated to answer the question in terms of oh yeah it's like some some terms of oh yeah it's like some some terms of oh yeah it's like some some number between zero do you think there number between zero do you think there number between zero do you think there is a singularity point where the is a singularity point where the is a singularity point where the machines will surpass the humans in machines will surpass the humans in machines will surpass the humans in terms of the pace of learning and terms of the pace of learning and terms of the pace of learning and adaption yeah and when do you think that adaption yeah and when do you think that adaption yeah and when do you think that point will occur point will occur point will occur I don't know I don't know when it will I don't know I don't know when it will I don't know I don't know when it will occur I think some additional advances occur I think some additional advances occur I think some additional advances will need to do will happen but will need to do will happen but will need to do will happen but you know I absolutely would not bet you know I absolutely would not bet you know I absolutely would not bet against this point occurring at some at against this point occurring at some at against this point occurring at some at some point can you give me a range is it some point can you give me a range is it some point can you give me a range is it at some point next month is it next year at some point next month is it next year at some point next month is it next year you know you know you know I think it's like the the uncertainty on I think it's like the the uncertainty on I think it's like the the uncertainty on this thing is quite High because these this thing is quite High because these this thing is quite High because these advances I can imagine it can take in advances I can imagine it can take in advances I can imagine it can take in quite a while I can imagine it can take quite a while I can imagine it can take quite a while I can imagine it can take any disappoint in a long time I can also any disappoint in a long time I can also any disappoint in a long time I can also imagine it's taking you know some some some number of years but it's just very it's number of years but it's just very it's number of years but it's just very it's very hard to give a Cali braided answer very hard to give a Cali braided answer very hard to give a Cali braided answer and I I know there's lots of push and I I know there's lots of push and I I know there's lots of push forward so I'm going to ask one more forward so I'm going to ask one more forward so I'm going to ask one more question then move on to some of the question then move on to some of the question then move on to some of the other issues but um I know I read that other issues but um I know I read that other issues but um I know I read that when you were a child you were disturbed when you were a child you were disturbed when you were a child you were disturbed by the notion of Consciousness and I by the notion of Consciousness and I by the notion of Consciousness and I wasn't sure what that what that word wasn't sure what that what that word wasn't sure what that what that word meant Disturbed but I'm curious do you meant Disturbed but I'm curious do you meant Disturbed but I'm curious do you view Consciousness or sentience or view Consciousness or sentience or view Consciousness or sentience or self-awareness as an extenuation of self-awareness as an extenuation of self-awareness as an extenuation of learning do you think that that is learning do you think that that is learning do you think that that is something that also is an inevitability something that also is an inevitability something that also is an inevitability that will happen or not that will happen or not that will happen or not yeah I mean on the Consciousness yeah I mean on the Consciousness yeah I mean on the Consciousness questions questions questions like yeah I was as a child that would like yeah I was as a child that would like yeah I was as a child that would like you know look into my in my hand like you know look into my in my hand like you know look into my in my hand and I would be like how can it be that and I would be like how can it be that and I would be like how can it be that this is my hand that I get to see like I this is my hand that I get to see like I this is my hand that I get to see like I something of this nature I don't know something of this nature I don't know something of this nature I don't know how to explain it much better so that's how to explain it much better so that's how to explain it much better so that's been something I was curious about been something I was curious about been something I was curious about you know it's It's Tricky with Consciousness because It's Tricky with Consciousness because It's Tricky with Consciousness because how do you define it it's something that how do you define it it's something that how do you define it it's something that the looted definition for a long time the looted definition for a long time the looted definition for a long time and how can you test it in a system and how can you test it in a system and how can you test it in a system maybe there is a system which acts maybe there is a system which acts maybe there is a system which acts perfectly right but um perfectly the way perfectly right but um perfectly the way perfectly right but um perfectly the way you'd expect you'd expect you'd expect um um um a conscious system would act yet maybe a conscious system would act yet maybe a conscious system would act yet maybe it won't be conscious for some reason I it won't be conscious for some reason I it won't be conscious for some reason I do think there is a very simple way to do think there is a very simple way to do think there is a very simple way to there's there is an experiment which we there's there is an experiment which we there's there is an experiment which we could run on an AI system which we can't could run on an AI system which we can't could run on an AI system which we can't run on which we can't run just yet but run on which we can't run just yet but run on which we can't run just yet but maybe maybe maybe in like the Future Point when the AI in like the Future Point when the AI in like the Future Point when the AI learns very very quickly from less from learns very very quickly from less from learns very very quickly from less from less data we could do the following less data we could do the following less data we could do the following experiment experiment experiment very carefully with very carefully very carefully with very carefully very carefully with very carefully curate the data curate the data curate the data such that we never ever mention anything such that we never ever mention anything such that we never ever mention anything about consciousness it would only say about consciousness it would only say about consciousness it would only say you know here is you know here is you know here is here's a ball and here's a castle and here's a ball and here's a castle and here's a ball and here's a castle and here is like a little toy like you would here is like a little toy like you would here is like a little toy like you would imagine imagine you'd have data of this imagine imagine you'd have data of this imagine imagine you'd have data of this sort it would be very controlled maybe sort it would be very controlled maybe sort it would be very controlled maybe we'd have some number of years worth of we'd have some number of years worth of we'd have some number of years worth of this kind of training data this kind of training data this kind of training data maybe it would be maybe such an AI maybe it would be maybe such an AI maybe it would be maybe such an AI system would be interacting with a lot system would be interacting with a lot system would be interacting with a lot of different teachers learning from them of different teachers learning from them of different teachers learning from them but all very carefully you never ever but all very carefully you never ever but all very carefully you never ever mentioned Consciousness you don't talk mentioned Consciousness you don't talk

surface anything except for the most surface level Notions of their experience and level Notions of their experience and level Notions of their experience and then at some point you sit down this Ai then at some point you sit down this Ai then at some point you sit down this Ai and you say Okay I want to tell you and you say Okay I want to tell you and you say Okay I want to tell you about Consciousness it's the stain about Consciousness it's the stain about Consciousness it's the stain that's a little bit not well understood that's a little bit not well understood that's a little bit not well understood people disagree about it but that's how people disagree about it but that's how people disagree about it but that's how they describe it and imagine if the AI they describe it and imagine if the AI they describe it and imagine if the AI then goes and says oh my god I've been then goes and says oh my god I've been then goes and says oh my god I've been feeling the same thing but I didn't know feeling the same thing but I didn't know feeling the same thing but I didn't know how to articulate it that would be okay how to articulate it that would be okay how to articulate it that would be okay that would be definitely something to that would be definitely something to that would be definitely something to think about it's like if the AI was just think about it's like if the AI was just think about it's like if the AI was just trained on very mundane data around trained on very mundane data around trained on very mundane data around objects and going from place to place or objects and going from place to place or objects and going from place to place or maybe you know something like this from a very narrow something like this from a very narrow something like this from a very narrow set of Concepts we would never ever set of Concepts we would never ever set of Concepts we would never ever mention that and if it could somehow mention that and if it could somehow mention that and if it could somehow eloquently correctly talk about it in a eloquently correctly talk about it in a eloquently correctly talk about it in a way that we would recognize that

it's pretty continuous yeah continuous yeah continuous yeah okay I want to move on even though I okay I want to move on even though I okay I want to move on even though I could I would love to keep asking more could I would love to keep asking more could I would love to keep asking more questions along the lines of the questions along the lines of the questions along the lines of the technology but I want to move on to technology but I want to move on to technology but I want to move on to talking about the mission of openai and talking about the mission of openai and talking about the mission of openai and how you perceive or any issues around how you perceive or any issues around how you perceive or any issues around ethics and your role as Chief science ethics and your role as Chief science ethics and your role as Chief science officer how ethics informs if at all how officer how ethics informs if at all how officer how ethics informs if at all how you think about your role and so let me you think about your role and so let me you think about your role and so let me just lay a couple Foundation points out just lay a couple Foundation points out just lay a couple Foundation points out and then have you speak and then have you speak and then have you speak um as you know open ai's mission is to um as you know open ai's mission is to um as you know open ai's mission is to ensure the art of that artificial ensure the art of that artificial ensure the art of that artificial general intelligence benefits all of general intelligence benefits all of general intelligence benefits all of humanity and it started off as a humanity and it started off as a humanity and it started off as a non-profit and open source and it is now non-profit and open source and it is now non-profit and open source and it is now a for-profit and closed-sourced and with a for-profit and closed-sourced and with a for-profit and closed-sourced and with a close relationship with Microsoft and a close relationship with Microsoft and a close relationship with Microsoft and Elon Musk who I believe recruited you to Elon Musk who I believe recruited you to Elon Musk who I believe recruited you to originally join open Ai and gave 100 originally join open Ai and gave 100 originally join open Ai and gave 100 million dollars when it was a non-profit million dollars when it was a non-profit million dollars when it was a non-profit has says that the original Vision was to has says that the original Vision was to has says that the original Vision was to create a counterweight to Google and the create a counterweight to Google and the create a counterweight to Google and the corporate world and he didn't want to corporate world and he didn't want to corporate world and he didn't want to have a world in which AI which is has have a world in which AI which is has have a world in which AI which is has which he perceives and others can have which he perceives and others can have which he perceives and others can have an existential threat to humanity to be an existential threat to humanity to be an existential threat to humanity to be solely in the holds of of corporate of a solely in the holds of of corporate of a solely in the holds of of corporate of a for-profit for-profit for-profit um and now um and now um and now open AI is neither open nor exclusively open AI is neither open nor exclusively open AI is neither open nor exclusively a non-profit it's also a for-profit with a non-profit it's also a for-profit with a non-profit it's also a for-profit with close ties to Microsoft and it looks close ties to Microsoft and it looks close ties to Microsoft and it looks like the world may be headed towards like the world may be headed towards like the world may be headed towards um a private duopoly between Microsoft um a private duopoly between Microsoft um a private duopoly between Microsoft and Google and Google and Google can you shed light on the calculus to can you shed light on the calculus to can you shed light on the calculus to shift from a for-profit to a non-profit shift from a for-profit to a non-profit shift from a for-profit to a non-profit and did you weigh in the ethics of that and did you weigh in the ethics of that and did you weigh in the ethics of that decision and do ethics play a role in decision and do ethics play a role in decision and do ethics play a role in how you conceive of your role as the how you conceive of your role as the how you conceive of your role as the chief science officer or do you view it chief science officer or do you view it chief science officer or do you view it more as something that somebody else more as something that somebody else more as something that somebody else should handle and you are mainly just should handle and you are mainly just should handle and you are mainly just tasked with pushing the technology tasked with pushing the technology tasked with pushing the technology forward yeah so this question is many parts let yeah so this question is many parts let yeah so this question is many parts let me yeah let me think about the best way me yeah let me think about the best way me yeah let me think about the best way to to approach it to to approach it to to approach it so there are several parts there is the there is the question around open source there is the question around open source there is the question around open source versus closed source versus closed source versus closed source there is a question around non-profit there is a question around non-profit there is a question around non-profit versus for-profit versus for-profit versus for-profit and the connection with Microsoft and the connection with Microsoft and the connection with Microsoft and how to see that in the context of and how to see that in the context of and how to see that in the context of Elon musk's recent comments Elon musk's recent comments Elon musk's recent comments and then the question about how I see my and then the question about how I see my and then the question about how I see my role in this maybe I'll start with that role in this maybe I'll start with that role in this maybe I'll start with that because I think that's easier Okay so I feel I feel I feel yeah yeah yeah the way I see my role the way I see my role the way I see my role I feel a lot I I feel I feel a lot I I feel I feel a lot I I feel direct responsibility for whatever open direct responsibility for whatever open direct responsibility for whatever open AI does even though AI does even though AI does even though I my role is primarily around advancing I my role is primarily around advancing I my role is primarily around advancing the science the science the science it is still the case I'm one of the it is still the case I'm one of the it is still the case I'm one of the founders of the company founders of the company founders of the company and and and ultimately I care a lot ultimately I care a lot ultimately I care a lot about open ai's overall impact about open ai's overall impact about open ai's overall impact now I want to go so with this context I now I want to go so with this context I now I want to go so with this context I want to go and talk about the open want to go and talk about the open want to go and talk about the open source versus closed source source versus closed source source versus closed source and the non-profit versus for-profit and the non-profit versus for-profit and the non-profit versus for-profit and I want to start with open source and I want to start with open source and I want to start with open source which is closed source which is closed source which is closed source because I think that because I think that because I think that you know the challenge with AI you know the challenge with AI you know the challenge with AI is that AI is so all encompassing is that AI is so all encompassing is that AI is so all encompassing encompassing encompassing encompassing and it comes with many different and it comes with many different and it comes with many different challenges it comes with many many challenges it comes with many many challenges it comes with many many different dentures different dentures different dentures which come into conflict with each other which come into conflict with each other which come into conflict with each other and I think the open source versus and I think the open source versus and I think the open source versus closed source is a great example of that closed source is a great example of that closed source is a great example of that why is it desirable well let me put it why is it desirable well let me put it why is it desirable well let me put it this way this way this way what are some reasons what are some reasons what are some reasons for which it is desirable to open source for which it is desirable to open source for which it is desirable to open source AI AI AI the answer there would be the answer there would be the answer there would be to to to prevent prevent prevent concentration of power concentration of power concentration of power in the hands of those who are building in the hands of those who are building in the hands of those who are building the AI so if you are in a world where the AI so if you are in a world where the AI so if you are in a world where let's say there is only a small number let's say there is only a small number let's say there is only a small number of companies you might that control this of companies you might that control this of companies you might that control this very powerful technology very powerful technology very powerful technology you might say this is an undesirable you might say this is an undesirable you might say this is an undesirable world and that AI should be open and world and that AI should be open and world and that AI should be open and that anyone could use the AI this is the that anyone could use the AI this is the that anyone could use the AI this is the argument for open source argument for open source argument for open source but this argument but this argument but this argument you know of course you know to State the you know of course you know to State the you know of course you know to State the obvious there are near-term commercial obvious there are near-term commercial obvious there are near-term commercial incentives against open source but there incentives against open source but there incentives against open source but there is another longer term argument against is another longer term argument against is another longer term argument against open sourcing as well which is open sourcing as well which is open sourcing as well which is if we believe if we believe if we believe if one believes that eventually AI is if one believes that eventually AI is if one believes that eventually AI is going to be unbelievably powerful going to be unbelievably powerful going to be unbelievably powerful if we get to a point where your AI is so if we get to a point where your AI is so if we get to a point where your AI is so powerful where you can just tell it hey powerful where you can just tell it hey powerful where you can just tell it hey can you autonomously can you autonomously can you autonomously create a biological I don't know a create a biological I don't know a create a biological I don't know a biological research lab biological research lab biological research lab autonomously autonomously autonomously do all the paperwork render space hire do all the paperwork render space hire do all the paperwork render space hire the technicians aggregate experiments do the technicians aggregate experiments do the technicians aggregate experiments do all this autonomously all this autonomously all this autonomously like that starts to get like that starts to get like that starts to get incredible that starts to get like incredible that starts to get like incredible that starts to get like mind-bandingly powerful should this be mind-bandingly powerful should this be mind-bandingly powerful should this be open sourced also open sourced also open sourced also so my position on the open source so my position on the open source so my position on the open source question is that I think that question is that I think that question is that I think that I think that there is a maybe I think that there is a maybe I think that there is a maybe a level of capability you can think a level of capability you can think a level of capability you can think about these neural networks in terms of about these neural networks in terms of about these neural networks in terms of capability capability capability how capable they are how smart they are how capable they are how smart they are how capable they are how smart they are how much how many how much how much can how much how many how much how much can how much how many how much how much can they do they do they do when the capability is on the lower end when the capability is on the lower end when the capability is on the lower end I think open sourcing is a great thing I think open sourcing is a great thing I think open sourcing is a great thing but at some point and you know there can but at some point and you know there can but at some point and you know there can be debate about where the pointer is be debate about where the pointer is be debate about where the pointer is but I would say that at some point the but I would say that at some point the but I would say that at some point the capability will become so vast that it capability will become so vast that it capability will become so vast that it will be obviously irresponsible to open will be obviously irresponsible to open will be obviously irresponsible to open source models and was that the driver source models and was that the driver source models and was that the driver Behind Closed sourcing it or was it Behind Closed sourcing it or was it Behind Closed sourcing it or was it driven by a a devil's compact or driven by a a devil's compact or driven by a a devil's compact or business necessity to get cash in uh business necessity to get cash in uh business necessity to get cash in uh from Microsoft or others to support the from Microsoft or others to support the from Microsoft or others to support the viability of the business was the viability of the business was the viability of the business was the decision making to close it down decision making to close it down decision making to close it down actually driven by that line of actually driven by that line of actually driven by that line of reasoning or was it driven by more so reasoning or was it driven by more so reasoning or was it driven by more so it's so so the way I'd articulate it you it's so so the way I'd articulate it you it's so so the way I'd articulate it you know my view is that the current level know my view is that the current level know my view is that the current level of capability is still not that high of capability is still not that high of capability is still not that high where it will be the safety where it will be the safety where it will be the safety consideration it will drive the close consideration it will drive the close consideration it will drive the close closed Source in the model this kind of closed Source in the model this kind of closed Source in the model this kind of this kind of research this kind of research this kind of research so in other words a claim that it goes so in other words a claim that it goes so in other words a claim that it goes in phases right now it is indeed the in phases right now it is indeed the in phases right now it is indeed the competitive phase but I claim that as competitive phase but I claim that as competitive phase but I claim that as the capabilities of these models keep the capabilities of these models keep the capabilities of these models keep increasing increasing increasing there will come a day where it will be there will come a day where it will be there will come a day where it will be the safety consideration that will be the safety consideration that will be the safety consideration that will be the obvious and immediate driver to not the obvious and immediate driver to not the obvious and immediate driver to not open source these models open source these models open source these models so this is the open source versus closed so this is the open source versus closed so this is the open source versus closed Source but your question had enough but Source but your question had enough but Source but your question had enough but your question in another part which is your question in another part which is your question in another part which is non-profit versus for-profit non-profit versus for-profit non-profit versus for-profit and we can talk about that also you know indeed it would be preferable you know indeed it would be preferable you know indeed it would be preferable in a certain meaningful sense if open AI in a certain meaningful sense if open AI in a certain meaningful sense if open AI could just be a for a non-profit from could just be a for a non-profit from could just be a for a non-profit from now until the mission of open AI is now until the mission of open AI is now until the mission of open AI is complete complete complete however one of the things that's worth however one of the things that's worth however one of the things that's worth pointing out is the very significant pointing out is the very significant pointing out is the very significant cost of these data centers I'm sure cost of these data centers I'm sure cost of these data centers I'm sure you're reading about various AI startups you're reading about various AI startups you're reading about various AI startups and the amount of money they are raising and the amount of money they are raising and the amount of money they are raising the great majority of which goes to the the great majority of which goes to the the great majority of which goes to the cloud providers cloud providers cloud providers why is that why is that why is that well the reason so much money is needed well the reason so much money is needed well the reason so much money is needed is because is because is because this is this is this is the nature of these large neural the nature of these large neural the nature of these large neural networks they need the compute end of networks they need the compute end of networks they need the compute end of story you can see something like this story you can see something like this story you can see something like this that's all you can see a divide that's that's all you can see a divide that's that's all you can see a divide that's now happening between Academia now happening between Academia now happening between Academia and the AI companies and the AI companies and the AI companies so for a long time for many decades so for a long time for many decades so for a long time for many decades Cutting Edge research in AI took place Cutting Edge research in AI took place Cutting Edge research in AI took place in academic departments in universities in academic departments in universities in academic departments in universities that cap being the case up until the that cap being the case up until the that cap being the case up until the mid-2010s mid-2010s mid-2010s but at some point when the complexity but at some point when the complexity but at some point when the complexity and the cost of this project started to and the cost of this project started to and the cost of this project started to get very large it no longer remained get very large it no longer remained get very large it no longer remained possible for universities to be possible for universities to be possible for universities to be competitive and now universities need a competitive and now universities need a competitive and now universities need a University Research in AI needs to find University Research in AI needs to find University Research in AI needs to find some other way in which to contribute some other way in which to contribute some other way in which to contribute those ways exist they're just different those ways exist they're just different those ways exist they're just different from the way they're used to and from the way they're used to and from the way they're used to and different from the way the companies are different from the way the companies are different from the way the companies are contributing right now contributing right now contributing right now now now now with this context you're saying okay with this context you're saying okay with this context you're saying okay the thing about non-profit a non-profit the thing about non-profit a non-profit the thing about non-profit a non-profit is the people who give money to a is the people who give money to a is the people who give money to a non-profit never get to see any any of non-profit never get to see any any of non-profit never get to see any any of it back it is a real donation it back it is a real donation it back it is a real donation and believe it or not it is quite a bit and believe it or not it is quite a bit and believe it or not it is quite a bit harder to convince people to give money harder to convince people to give money harder to convince people to give money to a non-profit and so we so so we think to a non-profit and so we so so we think to a non-profit and so we so so we think what's what's the solution there or what what's what's the solution there or what what's what's the solution there or what is a good course of action is a good course of action is a good course of action so we came up with an idea so we came up with an idea so we came up with an idea that to my knowledge is unique that to my knowledge is unique that to my knowledge is unique in all corporate structures in the world in all corporate structures in the world in all corporate structures in the world the open air corporate structure is the open air corporate structure is the open air corporate structure is absolutely unique absolutely unique absolutely unique open AI is not a for-profit company it open AI is not a for-profit company it open AI is not a for-profit company it is a capped profit company is a capped profit company is a capped profit company and I'd like to explain what that means and I'd like to explain what that means and I'd like to explain what that means what that means what that means what that means is that is that is that equity in open AI can be better seen as equity in open AI can be better seen as equity in open AI can be better seen as Bond rather than equity in a normal Bond rather than equity in a normal Bond rather than equity in a normal company the main feature of a bond is company the main feature of a bond is company the main feature of a bond is that once it's paid out it's gone that once it's paid out it's gone that once it's paid out it's gone so in other words so in other words so in other words open AI has a finite obligation to its open AI has a finite obligation to its open AI has a finite obligation to its investors as opposed to an infinite investors as opposed to an infinite investors as opposed to an infinite obligation to that normal companies have obligation to that normal companies have obligation to that normal companies have and does that include the founders do and does that include the founders do and does that include the founders do the founders have equity in open AI the founders have equity in open AI the founders have equity in open AI so Sam Altman does not have equity so Sam Altman does not have equity so Sam Altman does not have equity but the other Founders do and is it but the other Founders do and is it but the other Founders do and is it capped or is it unlimited it is capped capped or is it unlimited it is capped capped or is it unlimited it is capped and how does that cap is that capped at and how does that cap is that capped at and how does that cap is that capped at because the the founders I presume because the the founders I presume because the the founders I presume didn't buy in unless it's capped at the didn't buy in unless it's capped at the didn't buy in unless it's capped at the nominal nominal nominal Share value Share value Share value um um um I'm not sure I understand the question I'm not sure I understand the question I'm not sure I understand the question precisely but what I can say like what precisely but what I can say like what precisely but what I can say like what what I can answer the part which I do what I can answer the part which I do what I can answer the part which I do understand which is like understand which is like understand which is like there is certainly like it isn't there there is certainly like it isn't there there is certainly like it isn't there are it is a different it is different are it is a different it is different are it is a different it is different from normal startup Equity but there are from normal startup Equity but there are from normal startup Equity but there are some similarities as well where the some similarities as well where the some similarities as well where the earlier you join the company earlier you join the company earlier you join the company the higher the cap is because then the higher the cap is because then the higher the cap is because then the larger cap is needed to attract the the larger cap is needed to attract the the larger cap is needed to attract the initial investors as the company initial investors as the company initial investors as the company continues to succeed the cap decreases continues to succeed the cap decreases continues to succeed the cap decreases and why is that important it's important and why is that important it's important and why is that important it's important because it means that the company because it means that the company because it means that the company one once when once all the obligation to one once when once all the obligation to one once when once all the obligation to investors and employees are paid out investors and employees are paid out investors and employees are paid out open AI becomes a non-profit again open AI becomes a non-profit again open AI becomes a non-profit again and you can say this is totally crazy and you can say this is totally crazy and you can say this is totally crazy what are you talking about like it's not what are you talking about like it's not what are you talking about like it's not going to change anything going to change anything going to change anything but it's worth considering what we but it's worth considering what we but it's worth considering what we expect like it's worth expect like it's worth expect like it's worth looking at what we think AI will be looking at what we think AI will be looking at what we think AI will be I mean we can look at what AI is today I mean we can look at what AI is today I mean we can look at what AI is today and I think it is not at all and I think it is not at all and I think it is not at all inconceivable inconceivable inconceivable for open AI tool achieve its for open AI tool achieve its for open AI tool achieve its to pay out its obligation to the to pay out its obligation to the to pay out its obligation to the investors and employees become a investors and employees become a investors and employees become a non-profit at around the time when non-profit at around the time when non-profit at around the time when perhaps the computers will become so perhaps the computers will become so perhaps the computers will become so capable where the economic destruction capable where the economic destruction capable where the economic destruction will be very big where this transition will be very big where this transition will be very big where this transition will be very beneficial will be very beneficial will be very beneficial so this is the answer on the cap profit so this is the answer on the cap profit so this is the answer on the cap profit versus versus versus non-profit non-profit non-profit there was a last part to your question I there was a last part to your question I there was a last part to your question I know I'm speaking for a while but the know I'm speaking for a while but the know I'm speaking for a while but the question had many parts the last part of question had many parts the last part of question had many parts the last part of your question is the Microsoft your question is the Microsoft your question is the Microsoft relationship relationship relationship and so here so here so here the thing that's very fortunate the thing that's very fortunate the thing that's very fortunate is that Microsoft is a there thinking about these questions the there thinking about these questions the there thinking about these questions the right way they understand right way they understand right way they understand the potential and the gravity of AGI and the potential and the gravity of AGI and the potential and the gravity of AGI and so for example on the on all the so for example on the on all the so for example on the on all the investor documents that any investor in investor documents that any investor in investor documents that any investor in open AI has signed and by the way open AI has signed and by the way open AI has signed and by the way Microsoft is an investor into open AI Microsoft is an investor into open AI Microsoft is an investor into open AI which is a very different relationship which is a very different relationship which is a very different relationship from the from the from the deepmind deepmind deepmind any anyone who signed any document any any anyone who signed any document any any anyone who signed any document any investment document there is a a purple investment document there is a a purple investment document there is a a purple rectangle at the top of the investment rectangle at the top of the investment rectangle at the top of the investment document which says that the fiduciary document which says that the fiduciary document which says that the fiduciary duty of open AI is to the open AI duty of open AI is to the open AI duty of open AI is to the open AI mission mission mission which means that you run the risk of which means that you run the risk of which means that you run the risk of potentially losing all your money if the potentially losing all your money if the potentially losing all your money if the mission comes in conflict mission comes in conflict mission comes in conflict so this is something that all the so this is something that all the so this is something that all the investors have signed investors have signed investors have signed and let me just make this clear for and let me just make this clear for and let me just make this clear for everybody because Google Google acquired everybody because Google Google acquired everybody because Google Google acquired deepmind so deepmind was just an asset deepmind so deepmind was just an asset deepmind so deepmind was just an asset inside of Google but beholden to Google inside of Google but beholden to Google inside of Google but beholden to Google you're making the distinction that with you're making the distinction that with you're making the distinction that with openai Microsoft is an investor and so openai Microsoft is an investor and so openai Microsoft is an investor and so beholden to this fiduciary duty for the beholden to this fiduciary duty for the beholden to this fiduciary duty for the mission of openai which is held by the mission of openai which is held by the mission of openai which is held by the non-profit which is a is is a a GP or an non-profit which is a is is a a GP or an

years in terms of the five to ten years in terms of the correct shape of the product I imagine a correct shape of the product I imagine a correct shape of the product I imagine a little bit of both perhaps but this kind little bit of both perhaps but this kind little bit of both perhaps but this kind of question I mean I think it remains to be seen I I mean I think it remains to be seen I I mean I think it remains to be seen I think there are I think this stuff is think there are I think this stuff is think there are I think this stuff is still so new still so new still so new okay okay okay I'm gonna ask one more question I'm I'm gonna ask one more question I'm I'm gonna ask one more question I'm gonna jump to the student questions if gonna jump to the student questions if gonna jump to the student questions if you're a student at Stanford today you're a student at Stanford today you're a student at Stanford today interested in AI if you were you know interested in AI if you were you know interested in AI if you were you know somebody who wants to be Ilia um what somebody who wants to be Ilia um what somebody who wants to be Ilia um what would you focus your time and another would you focus your time and another would you focus your time and another second question on this if you're also second question on this if you're also second question on this if you're also interested in entrepreneurship interested in entrepreneurship interested in entrepreneurship um where would you what would you what um where would you what would you what um where would you what would you what advice would you give for a Stanford advice would you give for a Stanford advice would you give for a Stanford undergrad engineer that's interested in undergrad engineer that's interested in undergrad engineer that's interested in Ai and Entrepreneurship so so so I think on the first one it's always hard to give generic advice it's always hard to give generic advice it's always hard to give generic advice like this like this like this but but but I can still provide some generic advice I can still provide some generic advice I can still provide some generic advice nonetheless nonetheless nonetheless and I think it's something like it it is generally a good idea to lean it it is generally a good idea to lean it it is generally a good idea to lean into into into one's unique predispositions one's unique predispositions one's unique predispositions you know every you know why if you think you know every you know why if you think you know every you know why if you think if you look if you think about the set if you look if you think about the set if you look if you think about the set of let's say inclinations or skills or of let's say inclinations or skills or of let's say inclinations or skills or talents that the person might have the talents that the person might have the talents that the person might have the combination is pretty rare so leaning combination is pretty rare so leaning combination is pretty rare so leaning into that is a very good idea no matter into that is a very good idea no matter into that is a very good idea no matter which direction you choose to go look to which direction you choose to go look to which direction you choose to go look to going and then on the AI research like I would say like I would say like I would say I would say that there I would say that there I would say that there you know you know you know I could say something but even but there I could say something but even but there I could say something but even but there especially you want to lean into your especially you want to lean into your especially you want to lean into your own ideas and really ask yourself what own ideas and really ask yourself what own ideas and really ask yourself what can you is is there something can you is is there something can you is is there something that's totally obvious to you that makes that's totally obvious to you that makes that's totally obvious to you that makes you go why is everyone else not getting you go why is everyone else not getting you go why is everyone else not getting it if you feel like this that's a good it if you feel like this that's a good it if you feel like this that's a good sign it means that you might be able sign it means that you might be able sign it means that you might be able that that you you want to lean into that that that you you want to lean into that that that you you want to lean into that and explore it and see if your instinct and explore it and see if your instinct and explore it and see if your instinct is true or not it may not be true is true or not it may not be true is true or not it may not be true but you know my my advisor Jeff Hinton but you know my my advisor Jeff Hinton but you know my my advisor Jeff Hinton says this thing which I really like he says this thing which I really like he says this thing which I really like he says you should trust your intuition says you should trust your intuition says you should trust your intuition because if your intuition is good you go because if your intuition is good you go because if your intuition is good you go really far and if it's not good then really far and if it's not good then really far and if it's not good then there's nothing you can do there's nothing you can do there's nothing you can do hmm hmm hmm and as far as entrepreneurship is and as far as entrepreneurship is and as far as entrepreneurship is concerned concerned concerned I feel like I feel like I feel like this is a place where the unique this is a place where the unique this is a place where the unique perspective is even more valuable or perspective is even more valuable or perspective is even more valuable or maybe equally it's because it's maybe maybe equally it's because it's maybe maybe equally it's because it's maybe maybe I'll I'll explain why I think it's maybe I'll I'll explain why I think it's maybe I'll I'll explain why I think it's more valuable than in research well in more valuable than in research well in more valuable than in research well in research it's very valuable too but in research it's very valuable too but in research it's very valuable too but in entrepreneurship like you need to like entrepreneurship like you need to like entrepreneurship like you need to like almost pull from your unique life almost pull from your unique life almost pull from your unique life experience where you say okay I see this experience where you say okay I see this experience where you say okay I see this thing I see this technology I see thing I see this technology I see thing I see this technology I see something like take a very very Broad something like take a very very Broad something like take a very very Broad View and see if you can hone in on View and see if you can hone in on View and see if you can hone in on something and then actually just go for something and then actually just go for something and then actually just go for it it it so that would that would be the so that would that would be the so that would that would be the conclusion of my generic advice okay conclusion of my generic advice okay conclusion of my generic advice okay which is great that's also great I'm which is great that's also great I'm which is great that's also great I'm going to move on to the student question going to move on to the student question going to move on to the student question so one of the most upvoted question is so one of the most upvoted question is so one of the most upvoted question is how do you see the field of deep how do you see the field of deep how do you see the field of deep learning evolving in the next five to learning evolving in the next five to learning evolving in the next five to ten years let's see let's see let's see you know I expect deep learning to you know I expect deep learning to you know I expect deep learning to continue to make progress I continue to make progress I continue to make progress I I expect that I expect that I expect that you know there was a period of time you know there was a period of time you know there was a period of time where where where a lot of progress came from scaling a lot of progress came from scaling a lot of progress came from scaling and you you saw that most in the most and you you saw that most in the most and you you saw that most in the most pronounced way in going from GPT 1 to pronounced way in going from GPT 1 to pronounced way in going from GPT 1 to gpd3 gpd3 gpd3 but but but things will change a little bit the things will change a little bit the things will change a little bit the reason the reason that the reason that reason the reason that the reason that reason the reason that the reason that progress in scaling was so rapid is progress in scaling was so rapid is progress in scaling was so rapid is because people had all these data because people had all these data because people had all these data centers which they weren't using for a centers which they weren't using for a centers which they weren't using for a single training run single training run single training run so by simply reallocating existing so by simply reallocating existing so by simply reallocating existing resources you could make a lot of resources you could make a lot of resources you could make a lot of progress progress progress and it doesn't take that long and it doesn't take that long and it doesn't take that long necessarily to reallocate existing necessarily to reallocate existing necessarily to reallocate existing resources you just need to you know resources you just need to you know resources you just need to you know someone just needs to decide to do so someone just needs to decide to do so someone just needs to decide to do so it is different now because the training it is different now because the training it is different now because the training runs are very big and the scaling is not runs are very big and the scaling is not runs are very big and the scaling is not going to be progressing as fast as it going to be progressing as fast as it going to be progressing as fast as it used to be because building data center used to be because building data center used to be because building data center takes time takes time takes time but at the same time I expect deep but at the same time I expect deep but at the same time I expect deep learning to continue to make progress in learning to continue to make progress in learning to continue to make progress in uh from other places the Deep learning uh from other places the Deep learning uh from other places the Deep learning stack is quite deep and I expect that stack is quite deep and I expect that stack is quite deep and I expect that there will be improvements in many there will be improvements in many there will be improvements in many layers of the stack and together they layers of the stack and together they layers of the stack and together they will still lead to progress being very will still lead to progress being very will still lead to progress being very robust robust robust and so and so and so if I had to guess I'd imagine that there if I had to guess I'd imagine that there if I had to guess I'd imagine that there would be maybe I'm certain we will discover new I'm certain we will discover new I'm certain we will discover new properties which are currently unknown properties which are currently unknown properties which are currently unknown of deep learning and those properties of deep learning and those properties of deep learning and those properties will be utilized and I fully expect that will be utilized and I fully expect that will be utilized and I fully expect that the systems of five to ten years from the systems of five to ten years from the systems of five to ten years from now will be much much better than once now will be much much better than once now will be much much better than once they are we have right now they are we have right now they are we have right now but exactly how it's going to look like but exactly how it's going to look like but exactly how it's going to look like I think I think I think I think it's a bit harder to answer it's I think it's a bit harder to answer it's I think it's a bit harder to answer it's a bit like it's because the improvements that there it's because the improvements that there it's because the improvements that there is there will be maybe a small number of is there will be maybe a small number of is there will be maybe a small number of big improvements and also a large number big improvements and also a large number big improvements and also a large number of small improvements all integrated of small improvements all integrated of small improvements all integrated into a large complex engineering into a large complex engineering into a large complex engineering artifact artifact artifact and can I ask your you know your and can I ask your you know your and can I ask your you know your co-founder Sam Altman has said that co-founder Sam Altman has said that co-founder Sam Altman has said that we've reached the limits of what we can we've reached the limits of what we can we've reached the limits of what we can achieve by scaling to larger language achieve by scaling to larger language achieve by scaling to larger language models is do you agree models is do you agree models is do you agree um and if so you know what then what is um and if so you know what then what is um and if so you know what then what is the next Innovation Frontier that you're the next Innovation Frontier that you're the next Innovation Frontier that you're focusing on if that's the case yeah so I think maybe I think maybe I think maybe I don't remember I don't know exactly I don't remember I don't know exactly I don't remember I don't know exactly what he said but maybe he meant what he said but maybe he meant what he said but maybe he meant something like that the age of easy something like that the age of easy something like that the age of easy scaling has ended or something like this scaling has ended or something like this scaling has ended or something like this like of course of course the larger like of course of course the larger like of course of course the larger neural Nets will be better but it will neural Nets will be better but it will neural Nets will be better but it will be a lot of effort and cost to do them be a lot of effort and cost to do them be a lot of effort and cost to do them but I think there will be lots of but I think there will be lots of but I think there will be lots of different Frontiers and actually into different Frontiers and actually into different Frontiers and actually into the question of how can one contribute the question of how can one contribute the question of how can one contribute in deep learning identifying such a in deep learning identifying such a in deep learning identifying such a frontier perhaps one that's been missed frontier perhaps one that's been missed frontier perhaps one that's been missed by others is very fruitful by others is very fruitful by others is very fruitful and is it can I go even just deeper on and is it can I go even just deeper on and is it can I go even just deeper on that because I think there is this that because I think there is this that because I think there is this debate about vertical Focus versus debate about vertical Focus versus debate about vertical Focus versus General General General um uh General's training you know is it um uh General's training you know is it um uh General's training you know is it better do you think there's better better do you think there's better better do you think there's better performance that can be achieved in performance that can be achieved in performance that can be achieved in particular domains such as law or particular domains such as law or particular domains such as law or Medicine by training with special data Medicine by training with special data Medicine by training with special data sets or is it likely that generalist sets or is it likely that generalist sets or is it likely that generalist training with all available data will be training with all available data will be training with all available data will be more beneficial more beneficial more beneficial so so so like at some point we should absolutely like at some point we should absolutely like at some point we should absolutely expect Specialists training to make a expect Specialists training to make a expect Specialists training to make a huge impact huge impact huge impact but the reason we do the generalist but the reason we do the generalist but the reason we do the generalist training training training is just so that we can even reach the is just so that we can even reach the is just so that we can even reach the point where point where point where just so that we can reach the point where the neural network can even where the neural network can even where the neural network can even understand the questions that we are understand the questions that we are understand the questions that we are asking and only when it has a very asking and only when it has a very asking and only when it has a very robust understanding only then we can go robust understanding only then we can go robust understanding only then we can go into specialist training and really into specialist training and really into specialist training and really benefit from it so yeah I mean I think benefit from it so yeah I mean I think benefit from it so yeah I mean I think all these I think these are all fruitful all these I think these are all fruitful all these I think these are all fruitful directions directions directions but you don't think when do you think but you don't think when do you think but you don't think when do you think we'll be at that point when specialist we'll be at that point when specialist we'll be at that point when specialist training training training is the thing to focus on I mean you know like if you look at people who you know like if you look at people who you know like if you look at people who do open source work people who work with do open source work people who work with do open source work people who work with open source models they do a fair bit of open source models they do a fair bit of open source models they do a fair bit of this kind of specialist training because this kind of specialist training because this kind of specialist training because they have a fairly underpowered model they have a fairly underpowered model they have a fairly underpowered model and they try to get any ounce of and they try to get any ounce of and they try to get any ounce of performance they can out of it performance they can out of it performance they can out of it so I would say that this is an example so I would say that this is an example so I would say that this is an example I'd say that this is an example of it I'd say that this is an example of it I'd say that this is an example of it happening like it's already happening to happening like it's already happening to happening like it's already happening to some degree it's not a binary it's you some degree it's not a binary it's you some degree it's not a binary it's you might want to think of it as of like a might want to think of it as of like a might want to think of it as of like a continual Spectrum but do you think that continual Spectrum but do you think that continual Spectrum but do you think that the competitor do you think that the the competitor do you think that the the competitor do you think that the winning Advantage is going to be having winning Advantage is going to be having winning Advantage is going to be having these proprietary data sets or is it these proprietary data sets or is it these proprietary data sets or is it going to be having a much higher going to be having a much higher going to be having a much higher performance large language model when it performance large language model when it performance large language model when it comes to these applications of AI into comes to these applications of AI into comes to these applications of AI into verticals verticals verticals so I think it may be productive to think so I think it may be productive to think so I think it may be productive to think about about an AI like this as a about about an AI like this as a about about an AI like this as a combination of multiple factors where combination of multiple factors where combination of multiple factors where each factor makes a contribution each factor makes a contribution each factor makes a contribution and and and is it better to have a special data is it better to have a special data is it better to have a special data which helps you make which helps you make which helps you make your AI better in a particular set of your AI better in a particular set of your AI better in a particular set of tasks of course is it better to have a tasks of course is it better to have a tasks of course is it better to have a more capable base model of course from more capable base model of course from more capable base model of course from the perspective of the task so maybe the perspective of the task so maybe the perspective of the task so maybe this is the the answer it's not an this is the the answer it's not an this is the the answer it's not an either or either or either or I'm going to move down to the other I'm going to move down to the other I'm going to move down to the other questions questions questions um there's a question on what was the um there's a question on what was the um there's a question on what was the cost of training and developing GPT T3 cost of training and developing GPT T3 cost of training and developing GPT T3 slash four slash four slash four yeah so yeah so yeah so you know for for obvious reasons I can't you know for for obvious reasons I can't you know for for obvious reasons I can't comment on that um but there I think there is a you know um but there I think there is a you know um but there I think there is a you know I think even from our research Community I think even from our research Community I think even from our research Community there's a strong desire to be able to there's a strong desire to be able to there's a strong desire to be able to get access to get access to get access to um uh to different aspects of open ai's um uh to different aspects of open ai's um uh to different aspects of open ai's technology and are there any plans for technology and are there any plans for technology and are there any plans for releasing it to researchers or to other releasing it to researchers or to other releasing it to researchers or to other startups to encourage more competition startups to encourage more competition startups to encourage more competition and Innovation some of the requests that and Innovation some of the requests that and Innovation some of the requests that I've heard are unfettered interactions I've heard are unfettered interactions I've heard are unfettered interactions without safeguards to understand the without safeguards to understand the without safeguards to understand the model's performance model specifications model's performance model specifications model's performance model specifications including details on how it was trained including details on how it was trained including details on how it was trained and access to the model itself I. E the and access to the model itself I. E the and access to the model itself I. E the trained parameters do you want to trained parameters do you want to trained parameters do you want to comment on any of that comment on any of that comment on any of that yeah I mean I think like it's related to our earlier like it's related to our earlier like it's related to our earlier question about open versus closed question about open versus closed question about open versus closed I think that there are some I think that there are some I think that there are some intermediate approaches which can be intermediate approaches which can be intermediate approaches which can be very fruitful very fruitful very fruitful for example for example for example model access and various combinations of model access and various combinations of model access and various combinations of that that that can be very very productive because can be very very productive because can be very very productive because these mineral networks already have such these mineral networks already have such these mineral networks already have such a large and complicated surface area of a large and complicated surface area of a large and complicated surface area of behavior behavior behavior and and studying that alone can be extremely and studying that alone can be extremely and studying that alone can be extremely interesting look if you have an academic interesting look if you have an academic interesting look if you have an academic access problem we provide various forms access problem we provide various forms access problem we provide various forms of access to the models and in fact of access to the models and in fact of access to the models and in fact plenty of academic research Labs do plenty of academic research Labs do plenty of academic research Labs do study them in this way study them in this way study them in this way so so so I think this kind of approach I think this kind of approach I think this kind of approach is viable is viable is viable and it's something that we could that we and it's something that we could that we and it's something that we could that we are doing are doing are doing I know we're coming up on time I want to I know we're coming up on time I want to I know we're coming up on time I want to end with just one final question which end with just one final question which end with just one final question which is can you just share any unintuitive is can you just share any unintuitive is can you just share any unintuitive but compelling use cases for how you but compelling use cases for how you but compelling use cases for how you love to use chat gbt that others may not love to use chat gbt that others may not love to use chat gbt that others may not know about know about know about um so I mean I don't I wouldn't say that so I mean I don't I wouldn't say that so I mean I don't I wouldn't say that it's unknown but I I really enjoy its it's unknown but I I really enjoy its it's unknown but I I really enjoy its poem writing

I'm curious do you have any insights but I'm curious do you have any insights but I'm curious do you have any insights on how it changes Dynamics with teams on how it changes Dynamics with teams on how it changes Dynamics with teams when you have ai deeply integrated into when you have ai deeply integrated into when you have ai deeply integrated into you know a human team and how they're you know a human team and how they're you know a human team and how they're working and any insights into to what we working and any insights into to what we working and any insights into to what we may not know but that will come may not know but that will come may not know but that will come I would say I would say to today the I would say I would say to today the I would say I would say to today the best way to describe the impact is that best way to describe the impact is that best way to describe the impact is that everyone is a little bit more productive everyone is a little bit more productive everyone is a little bit more productive people are a little bit more on top of people are a little bit more on top of people are a little bit more on top of things I wouldn't say that right now things I wouldn't say that right now things I wouldn't say that right now there is a dramatic impact on Dynamics there is a dramatic impact on Dynamics there is a dramatic impact on Dynamics which I can say oh yeah the Dynamics which I can say oh yeah the Dynamics which I can say oh yeah the Dynamics have shifted in this pronounced way have shifted in this pronounced way have shifted in this pronounced way okay I'm curious if it depersonalizes okay I'm curious if it depersonalizes okay I'm curious if it depersonalizes conversations because it's the AI bot or conversations because it's the AI bot or conversations because it's the AI bot or maybe it but maybe we're not at that maybe it but maybe we're not at that maybe it but maybe we're not at that point yet where it's specifically point yet where it's specifically point yet where it's specifically that I definitely I I don't think that's that I definitely I I don't think that's that I definitely I I don't think that's the case and the case and the case and I predict that will not be the case but I predict that will not be the case but I predict that will not be the case but we'll see we'll see we'll see well
