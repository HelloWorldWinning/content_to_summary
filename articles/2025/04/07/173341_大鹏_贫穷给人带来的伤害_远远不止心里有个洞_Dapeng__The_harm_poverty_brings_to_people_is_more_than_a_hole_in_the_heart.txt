WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en-GB For example, homelessness, domestic violence, and isolation from everyone in the school. I was born in the 90s and suffered all kinds of hardships that I have never experienced. When I was 4 years old, my father took me to beg for food. The special service provider gave me a dumpling, but my father grabbed it and ate it. They beat and scolded me again and threw me in the public toilet. I would think that I have come out, right? I have become a very sunny person now, and I have not been blacklisted. Our program is a purely show person. There is actually no point in talking about one's pain because of his scars, so this movie was played for a long time, but I vaguely felt that he actually had a lot of bright spots in him. His kindness and resilience still touched me very much. Even after I passed For a long time, I still couldn't look directly at dumplings and raisins. When I went to one of his small start-up companies for the second time, I saw his growth and thinking in the past six months. His actions now actually tell us that for some so-called natives with D We don’t have to force ourselves to embrace our families. The most important thing is to live our true selves. You also mentioned two fathers in the interview. These two fathers actually caused more harm. One of the details is How did you feel when you saw him (biological father) eating that dumpling? It was quite cruel. Or maybe you were relatively young at the time. Well, you just felt like why you wanted to snatch food from me, just like D addiction. It feels like if he is not addicted to alcohol, how could he (biological father) give up drinking? I owe my life to him. My father and mother divorced when I was 4 years old. Most boys will By default, the house was awarded to my father after the divorce. My mother gave it to my father without asking for it, which meant that we told him to stop drinking. At least the two of us had a house to live in. But my father did not say anything harsh. To put it simply, a person's personality can't be changed. After selling the house, we have no place to live. So we have to live in Qiaodongzi. The most impressive thing is that there are many massage parlors near the Qiaodongzi where we live. They thought I was very pitiful for the special service and gave me a dumpling. After I took it back, my father grabbed it and ate it because I was very hungry. After the fight, I didn’t even finish eating. He would even beat me at that time. One way to describe me is my expression. It should be regarded as the most unbearable time in my life. I was wearing small torn slippers and was very dirty. My hair was very long and I couldn’t tell. You were a boy and you were very young at that time. I would listen to whatever my father said. Basically, he just picks up some rags every day. Who has thrown away cucumbers, who has thrown away dumplings, and the like. If he wants to drink and has no money, he can only say that I will pick up some scrap metal. After that, he went to sell. After that, he still bought wine. Later, I went to pick up things as normal. Then accidentally, I saw a small flower bag. That flower bag was my grandma’s flower bag. In my mind, she was She would carry one of her bags wherever she went. The skin color was like that of a tabby cat. One black and one white. Very beautiful. From a mathematical point of view, it should be a problem of meeting. We happened to miss each other, and when we turned around, then I saw my grandma. The first thing she did in the evening was to take me to get a haircut and take a shower. Then she talked to my father again and criticized her because it was true that my grandma would think that I put the child in your hands and then it was okay. The last thing I saw was that the child had become like this. When my grandma took my mother to pick me up, my mother was riding a bicycle. She carried me on her back, and my father chased me from behind. My father still wanted me to stay. Maybe he also had feelings for me, but it was a pity that I was very young at that time. I didn’t know what feelings were, so I went back home with my mother. Was that scene when your father chased you the last time you met? Yes, it's the last time in my life. According to rumors, my father seemed to have fallen into the river and froze to death. So how is your relationship with your mother now? I think the concept that I have always had with my mother is the most troublesome thing for me. Many people will think I am very ruthless. Many people will think that I am a white-eyed wolf. Many people will think that I am a person who has no heart at all. When I went to my mother's house, the experience was basically ah, and it was quite cruel. My stepfather actually didn't like me. He was also very cruel to me, beating and scolding me. One winter, probably during the Chinese New Year, my stepfather also got angry. He just wrapped me in a small quilt and threw me into a public toilet. The public toilet was a simple open-air one next to it. If there is a snowdrift, throw it into the snowdrift. My mother didn't dare to say a word at that time. If she said something, she would inevitably be beaten. I think the most serious beating was when my mother was dragged directly from the kang to the ground by her hair. Then I took that. In Northeastern dialect, we called a fire shovel and hit my mother on the lower back. My mother didn't dare to say anything. I don't know what kind of family my mother was in. She was in embarrassment. Did she have difficulties or something? But if she has difficulties, I don't know. I don’t understand that I can’t snatch whatever my half-brother wants to eat, and I can’t eat it. Maybe my stepfather will be unhappy if I eat one more pack of instant noodles, and I might have to say it all the time. My mother can't tell me in front of my stepfather. When she was sending me to school, she scolded me while riding her bicycle. Why are you so ignorant? Have you never eaten this instant noodles? After you finish doing this, your stepfather It’s time to be unhappy again, so the concept I’m given is that my mother is a very selfish person. In her mind, she only has her family and she doesn’t have me. I’m sorry. What kind of relationship do we have with my mother now? The physical relationship between mother and child is nothing more than that. I went to this (boarding) school when I was five and a half six years old. My grandma paid for all the expenses while I was there. After she finished, she said to my mother. I don’t ask you anything else. It’s best to pick me up on Friday night and wash the dirty clothes. If the child wants to eat, you can cook something. She didn’t come to pick me up. I am 365 days a year. I can only go home during the winter and summer vacations. I can describe that school. It is not like a prison. The marriage and family are very good and very happy. The children will not be sent here. The children who are locked in the building are all children who cannot go home. Everyone. They would think that I am not very gregarious because my world is different from theirs, and the environment we are exposed to is also different. Let me give you a simple real-life example. Everyone has eaten this raisin. At that time, I also knew what a raisin was, but I didn’t. After eating that raisin, they will just throw it to the ground and stomp on it. Do you want to eat it? If you want to eat it, just pick it up and eat it. Then I will pick it up and eat it. Because you want to eat it, because you have never eaten this thing, so even in the later stage, I will also I never eat raisins. My grandma transferred me when I was in fifth grade (from boarding school) and asked me to try to study in this public school. Is this alive? Yes, there are fish in it. Yes, the fish is right. After I came out of boarding school, my grandma took me to the park for the first Children's Day. There was a game in the park. There were several cans with various goldfish in them. I asked you to take a trap because I have never experienced this thing. My grandma told me after finishing it, let’s take 100 yuan to set this trap today. Do you want to set 10 fish, 20 fish, or a bunch of fish? I just think it is very novel and I may accept it. For children who have received a normal education, people may think that this thing has passed that time. When I came out of private (boarding) school, I felt out of touch. After that, my grandma took me to make up for this period of my life. During the gap period, we have a good saying, which is that if the east is not bright, the west must be bright. The main reason why I became a teacher is because I feel that the education I received is unfair, but I will think that I want to be a good teacher. All the students and parents I have taken care of since 2014 have been very respectful to me. In fact, I treat students as my own children. No matter which student I am, no matter where you go, I consider you to be my student. It is my child. My current dream is to hope that our company can reach a new high in financial data. My ultimate dream that I can imagine now is to have an independent small courtyard in Sanya by the sea. I can have friends or not, and family members too. You may or may not have it, because the marriage of my parents is not particularly good. Plus, I don’t have maternal love or paternal love. It’s possible that I may be different from others in this regard. You actually realize it. Does loneliness make you uncomfortable when you are alone? No, I feel that I am quite enjoying it. After I came out of fifth grade (boarding school), I basically just took the bus. What I am good at is that when I see the words on the neon sign, I will read it at night. After 90 o'clock, I drove my car to Tiananmen Square, which was Chang'an Street. I just drove for a walk without any destination. This was something I particularly enjoyed. It gave people the impression that this child was abnormal. Who would take the bus and look at the neon lights? Just read it. It means that you feel that the most comfortable state is to let yourself go and not think about anything. In fact, at that point in my life, many people will think, why don’t you get married and don’t have children? Aren’t you afraid of being lonely in the future? In fact, I think it’s because I don’t. The same goes for me getting married. I can also have children. For example, if I adopt a child, what I actually pursue is two words: freedom. Yes, I don’t want to be trapped by many things. In fact, we have experienced too many restrictions and restrictions in the past. Otherwise, the more I experience those things, the more I long for freedom. The more I long for myself, I will pursue the life I want. This is what drives us to live, right? We often feel that we have no choice because there is only one evaluation system accepted in our minds. But in fact it's probably not like that
