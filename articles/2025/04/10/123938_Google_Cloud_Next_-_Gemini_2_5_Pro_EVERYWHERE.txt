the Google Cloud Next keynote that's pretty awesome and that keynote that's pretty awesome and that keynote that's pretty awesome and that event just finished it was all about event just finished it was all about event just finished it was all about artificial intelligence they made some artificial intelligence they made some artificial intelligence they made some incredible announcements including some incredible announcements including some incredible announcements including some new agent stuff new text to video text new agent stuff new text to video text new agent stuff new text to video text to image some speech models and even to image some speech models and even to image some speech models and even agentto agent interoperability in which agentto agent interoperability in which agentto agent interoperability in which they partnered with our partner for this they partnered with our partner for this they partnered with our partner for this video Box so we're going to go over all video Box so we're going to go over all video Box so we're going to go over all of it right now and if you're wondering of it right now and if you're wondering of it right now and if you're wondering no that is not an AI background i'm on no that is not an AI background i'm on no that is not an AI background i'm on vacation but AI doesn't take vacation so vacation but AI doesn't take vacation so vacation but AI doesn't take vacation so I guess neither do I all right the first I guess neither do I all right the first I guess neither do I all right the first thing they're going to talk about is a thing they're going to talk about is a thing they're going to talk about is a new tensor processing unit this is a new tensor processing unit this is a new tensor processing unit this is a chip specifically designed to run their chip specifically designed to run their chip specifically designed to run their AI infrastructure and so let's take a AI infrastructure and so let's take a AI infrastructure and so let's take a look today I'm proud to announce our look today I'm proud to announce our look today I'm proud to announce our seventh generation TPU Ironwood is seventh generation TPU Ironwood is seventh generation TPU Ironwood is coming later this year compared to our first publicly available compared to our first publicly available compared to our first publicly available TPU Ironwood achieves 3600 times better TPU Ironwood achieves 3600 times better TPU Ironwood achieves 3600 times better performance an incredible increase it's performance an incredible increase it's performance an incredible increase it's the most powerful chip we have ever the most powerful chip we have ever the most powerful chip we have ever built and will enable the next frontier built and will enable the next frontier built and will enable the next frontier of AI models all right that is an of AI models all right that is an of AI models all right that is an insanely fast chip obviously it's just insanely fast chip obviously it's just insanely fast chip obviously it's just relative to the previous generations of relative to the previous generations of relative to the previous generations of chips but as you can see on the Yaxis chips but as you can see on the Yaxis chips but as you can see on the Yaxis this is performance in terms of flops so this is performance in terms of flops so this is performance in terms of flops so a massive massive improvement there the a massive massive improvement there the a massive massive improvement there the same period we've also become 29x more same period we've also become 29x more same period we've also become 29x more energy efficient and am mean will share energy efficient and am mean will share energy efficient and am mean will share more later today and power efficiency is more later today and power efficiency is more later today and power efficiency is just as important as performance because just as important as performance because just as important as performance because one of the limiting factors especially one of the limiting factors especially one of the limiting factors especially in the United States for AI is energy we in the United States for AI is energy we in the United States for AI is energy we simply don't have enough energy to power simply don't have enough energy to power simply don't have enough energy to power the next generation of AI applications the next generation of AI applications the next generation of AI applications so the more efficient we can get both so the more efficient we can get both so the more efficient we can get both with hardware and software the better with hardware and software the better with hardware and software the better it's going to be all right next he's it's going to be all right next he's it's going to be all right next he's just going to show off some of the just going to show off some of the just going to show off some of the qualifications of Gemini 2. 5 Pro which qualifications of Gemini 2. 5 Pro which qualifications of Gemini 2. 5 Pro which as you know is an absolutely incredible as you know is an absolutely
