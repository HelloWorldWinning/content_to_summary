Description:
好的，以下是针对您提供的文本的总结、核心观点、框架以及概念图，全部以简体中文呈现：

**总结：**

I.  **初期困境：**
    *   公司成立之初，缺乏正确的做事方法，只能依靠错误的方式。
    *   资金有限，只能购买少量参考书籍。

II. **解决方案与学习：**
    *   通过购买Silicon Graphics的书籍（教科书），工程师们开始学习正确的方法。
    *   工程师们通过学习，成功开发出了当时世界上最好的3D图形处理器。

III. **核心价值观的形成：**
    *   从这件事中得出的经验：聪明的人可以学习任何东西并做出贡献。
    *   这种学习能力和解决问题的态度成为公司的核心价值观，并延续至今。

IV. **应对新的挑战：**
    *   面对人工智能、自动驾驶汽车、机器人等新领域的挑战，公司秉持“这有多难？”的态度。
    *   虽然每个领域都非常困难，但公司相信通过学习，总能找到解决方案。
    *   经常认为解决问题只需要三个教科书的知识。

**核心观点：** 通过不断学习和解决问题的积极态度，即使面对最困难的挑战，也能取得成功。

**框架：**

该文本讲述了一个公司从最初的困境到通过学习和积极的态度克服困难，最终取得成功的故事，并在此过程中形成了独特的企业文化和价值观。

 On a day that we decided that we're gonna go do it right, it turns out none of us knew how to do it right. We only knew how to do it wrong. And so luckily, there's this other company called Silicon Graphics, the world leader at the time, and many of our colleagues that work at NVIDIA Now, and many of our employees that work at NVIDIA Now, they wrote this book while they were at Silicon Graphics of how to do it right. And so, so I didn't have very much money on me, but I think I had a couple hundred bucks on me. So I ran down to the store, ran down to the bookstore, and bought all of that book. We just, I bought three textbooks because that's all the money I had. I bought three textbooks, I brought it back, and I gave it to the engineers. I gave one to Chris, and gave one to a couple of other engineers. And so they started reading, and we built the world's best 3D graphics processor. And, and by the way, that lesson, the fact that we can learn almost anything, smart people can learn almost anything and make a contribution, that lesson permeates our company today. So when artificial intelligence came along, self-threatening cars came along, now robotics came along, the attitude of the company is how hard could it be? It turns out it's super hard. In every single case, it's turned out it was super hard. But you've got, but almost every single time, in my mind, we're probably about three textbooks away.
