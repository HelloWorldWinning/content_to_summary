好的，这是对提供的文本的总结，采用您要求的格式：

**核心要点总结：**

量化交易者通过预设的风险控制机制、多样化的策略和对历史数据的训练，在市场动荡时期保护资本，并伺机获利。

**大纲：**

1.  **引言：**
    *   市场崩盘为量化交易者提供了机会。
    *   量化交易在保护投资组合方面具有优势。
    *   持有现金在黑天鹅事件中也是一种获利方式。

2.  **量化交易者的核心策略**
    *   **“杀伤开关”：**
        *   预设指标或波动率模型触发。
        *   自动关闭策略以避免损失。
        *   例子：在3月11日关闭某些策略。
    *   **基于波动率的模型：**
        *   AI/ML模型根据不同特征进行交易。
        *   在市场波动初期（如3月）开始减少交易。
    *   **均值回归策略：**
        *   在经济衰退期间使用。
        *   主要在ETF上进行多空操作，而非股票，以避免保证金问题。
        *   利用波动率的收缩和扩张。
        *   例子：SPY ETF的均值回归策略，在市场下跌时获利。
    *   **资产配置策略：**
        *   TLT和黄金策略（LSTM模型）。
        *   根据市场环境调整SPY、黄金和TLT的配置。
        *   目标是在不同市场条件下实现稳定回报。
        *   对训练数据（2000-2020）和未来数据进行测试。

3.  **风险管理：**
    *   **避免过度杠杆：**
        *   坚持使用较低的杠杆比例（如2:1或3:1）。
        *   避免杠杆产品（期货、期权、外汇）。
    *   **保证金要求：**
        *   理解并避免保证金催缴。
        *   股票空头的保证金要求较高，因此选择ETF。
    *   **压力测试：**
        *   使用包含多次衰退时期的数据进行训练和测试。
        *   模型学习在极端市场条件下如何表现。

4.  **量化交易的优势：**
    *   **机械和无情绪：**
        *   策略预先设定，减少人为干预。
    *   **多样化：**
        *   结合趋势跟踪、动量、均值回归等多种策略。
    *   **数据驱动：**
        *   基于历史数据进行训练和测试。
        *   机器学习模型不断学习和改进。

**核心结论：**

量化交易者通过预设的风险控制机制、多样化的策略和对历史数据的训练，在市场动荡时期保护资本，并伺机获利。

**总体框架：**

量化交易的框架围绕**风险管理、策略多样性和数据驱动决策**展开，旨在在不同市场条件下实现稳定回报。

opportunity for quants as gives a great opportunity for quants as compared to traditional traders or compared to traditional traders or compared to traditional traders or investors and in this video we are going investors and in this video we are going investors and in this video we are going to discuss how quants have a massive to discuss how quants have a massive to discuss how quants have a massive edge in the way they protect their edge in the way they protect their edge in the way they protect their portfolio and we'll also discuss these portfolio and we'll also discuss these portfolio and we'll also discuss these strategies that ward them in this strategies that ward them in this strategies that ward them in this volatile markets so few months ago I had volatile markets so few months ago I had volatile markets so few months ago I had um an email from one of our student um an email from one of our student um an email from one of our student members and their concern was that why members and their concern was that why members and their concern was that why do I close all the positions and have no do I close all the positions and have no do I close all the positions and have no other trade on uh it's generally other trade on uh it's generally other trade on uh it's generally generating alpha when you are sitting on generating alpha when you are sitting on generating alpha when you are sitting on cash so uh my response to that was cash so uh my response to that was cash so uh my response to that was protecting your portfolio when there is protecting your portfolio when there is protecting your portfolio when there is a black swan event is in a sense a black swan event is in a sense a black swan event is in a sense generating alpha as you are generating generating alpha as you are generating generating alpha as you are generating more cash to invest when the market more cash to invest when the market more cash to invest when the market turns around at the bottom or for other turns around at the bottom or for other turns around at the bottom or for other strategies like me inverting uh and I strategies like me inverting uh and I strategies like me inverting uh and I also gave an example there are reasons also gave an example there are reasons also gave an example there are reasons uh why most hedge funds including uh why most hedge funds including uh why most hedge funds including Buffett alone only and move to cash and Buffett alone only and move to cash and Buffett alone only and move to cash and this is why uh so this email was way this is why uh so this email was way this is why uh so this email was way back on October and uh I don't think the back on October and uh I don't think the back on October and uh I don't think the student understood it back then or maybe student understood it back then or maybe student understood it back then or maybe he did But now right now with the he did But now right now with the he did But now right now with the current market conditions it's a perfect current market conditions it's a perfect current market conditions it's a perfect example on why going to cash is quite example on why going to cash is quite example on why going to cash is quite important uh so let's start with the important uh so let's start with the important uh so let's start with the first thing that quants do like quants first thing that quants do like quants first thing that quants do like quants have basically a kill switch so it could have basically a kill switch so it could have basically a kill switch so it could be based on a specific indicator or a be based on a specific indicator or a be based on a specific indicator or a volatile model so for example if the volatile model so for example if the volatile model so for example if the volatility goes above a certain uh volatility goes above a certain uh volatility goes above a certain uh threshold or if the price goes below a threshold or if the price goes below a threshold or if the price goes below a certain threshold then uh the market certain threshold then uh the market certain threshold then uh the market essentially uh with the strategy essentially uh with the strategy essentially uh with the strategy essentially shuts down um so for example essentially shuts down um so for example essentially shuts down um so for example here if I can get into one of the here if I can get into one of the here if I can get into one of the strategies or a couple of strategies strategies or a couple of strategies strategies or a couple of strategies we'll discuss a a couple of the we'll discuss a a couple of the we'll discuss a a couple of the portfolio based strategies um so I'm portfolio based strategies um so I'm portfolio based strategies um so I'm just going to uh this was in the just going to uh this was in the just going to uh this was in the Prometheus one uh so here if you look at Google one uh so here if you look at Google one uh so here if you look at Google there was a shutdown on that strategy on there was a shutdown on that strategy on there was a shutdown on that strategy on 11th of March and basically 11th of 11th of March and basically 11th of 11th of March and basically 11th of March was a shutdown for many of the March was a shutdown for many of the March was a shutdown for many of the strategies uh in our uh Prometheus strategies uh in our uh Prometheus strategies uh in our uh Prometheus content and this is basically a static content and this is basically a static content and this is basically a static one you can see again 11th of March here one you can see again 11th of March here one you can see again 11th of March here uh uh uh meta and the list goes on because it meta and the list goes on because it meta and the list goes on because it kind of protects your portfolio so uh kind of protects your portfolio so uh kind of protects your portfolio so uh this is one of the static models now on this is one of the static models now on this is one of the static models now on the other hand if you can look into the other hand if you can look into the other hand if you can look into volatility based models or the AI or ML volatility based models or the AI or ML volatility based models or the AI or ML models based on different input features models based on different input features models based on different input features so that is there in our decision tree so that is there in our decision tree so that is there in our decision tree strategy as well so uh in the decision strategy as well so uh in the decision strategy as well so uh in the decision tree strategy which basically trades a tree strategy which basically trades a tree strategy which basically trades a plethora of stocks so if you can go into plethora of stocks so if you can go into plethora of stocks so if you can go into the order section um it kind of started the order section um it kind of started the order section um it kind of started shutting down on the 26th 24th 10th shutting down on the 26th 24th 10th shutting down on the 26th 24th 10th early days of March uh some of them early days of March uh some of them early days of March uh some of them basically on the 10th of March and then basically on the 10th of March and then basically on the 10th of March and then some of them on the 24th and 26th as some of them on the 24th and 26th as some of them on the 24th and 26th as well so after the 10th of March I only well so after the 10th of March I only well so after the 10th of March I only ended one trade and that was in the PLT ended one trade and that was in the PLT ended one trade and that was in the PLT i was basically trying to test out i was basically trying to test out i was basically trying to test out different things uh so it's more a different things uh so it's more a different things uh so it's more a mechanical approach the quans have and mechanical approach the quans have and mechanical approach the quans have and this approach kind of protects them this approach kind of protects them this approach kind of protects them protects their portfolio and that kind protects their portfolio and that kind protects their portfolio and that kind of saves cash so uh there might be of saves cash so uh there might be of saves cash so uh there might be assumption that hey you're not doing any assumption that hey you're not doing any assumption that hey you're not doing any other trade but actually you are doing other trade but actually you are doing other trade but actually you are doing another trade you're doing a mean another trade you're doing a mean another trade you're doing a mean reverting strategy so uh so basically reverting strategy so uh so basically reverting strategy so uh so basically the strategies that quans do during the strategies that quans do during the strategies that quans do during recessions are fundamentally mean recessions are fundamentally mean recessions are fundamentally mean reverting strategies and that is done on reverting strategies and that is done on reverting strategies and that is done on ETF and that's what we recommend our ETF and that's what we recommend our ETF and that's what we recommend our students we do long and short on ETF and students we do long and short on ETF and students we do long and short on ETF and there is a reason why uh we don't do there is a reason why uh we don't do there is a reason why uh we don't do shorts uh in stocks because there is an shorts uh in stocks because there is an shorts uh in stocks because there is an issue with margin requirements which I issue with margin requirements which I issue with margin requirements which I will come in a bit so long and short on will come in a bit so long and short on will come in a bit so long and short on ETF and not stocks uh so what quans kind ETF and not stocks uh so what quans kind ETF and not stocks uh so what quans kind of make use is that they use the of make use is that they use the of make use is that they use the volatility contraction and volatility contraction and volatility contraction and expansion so whenever there's um it kind expansion so whenever there's um it kind expansion so whenever there's um it kind of swings away from the mean that's when of swings away from the mean that's when of swings away from the mean that's when they will sell and one of our strategies they will sell and one of our strategies they will sell and one of our strategies in that time was um just going to close this and it's on spy because we'll only this and it's on spy because we'll only this and it's on spy because we'll only be doing it on index ETF all our mean be doing it on index ETF all our mean be doing it on index ETF all our mean reverting strategies are on index ETF so reverting strategies are on index ETF so reverting strategies are on index ETF so if you can see here they created a short if you can see here they created a short if you can see here they created a short strategy right on 2nd of April and are strategy right on 2nd of April and are strategy right on 2nd of April and are will now be generating extremely mean will now be generating extremely mean will now be generating extremely mean reverting strategy so even here if you reverting strategy so even here if you reverting strategy so even here if you can look at it it's like short uh going can look at it it's like short uh going can look at it it's like short uh going long here when the market's going down long here when the market's going down long here when the market's going down extreme and then going short here long extreme and then going short here long extreme and then going short here long here short here so really making use of here short here so really making use of here short here so really making use of that opportunity so if I can look into that opportunity so if I can look into that opportunity so if I can look into this is the buy and hold equity line the this is the buy and hold equity line the this is the buy and hold equity line the blue line so if you can look at this blue line so if you can look at this blue line so if you can look at this graph here uh this is the dotcom bubble graph here uh this is the dotcom bubble graph here uh this is the dotcom bubble so when the market went down you can see so when the market went down you can see so when the market went down you can see the strategy uh making a ton of profit the strategy uh making a ton of profit the strategy uh making a ton of profit here and when the uh market went down here and when the uh market went down here and when the uh market went down the 2008 recession again you can see the the 2008 recession again you can see the the 2008 recession again you can see the steep graph here and again during the steep graph here and again during the steep graph here and again during the volatile um months few years ago again volatile um months few years ago again volatile um months few years ago again uh the market's making money here so uh the market's making money here so uh the market's making money here so here already the spy is going down and here already the spy is going down and here already the spy is going down and still it's holding on and it might give still it's holding on and it might give still it's holding on and it might give an opportunity so if the market does an opportunity so if the market does an opportunity so if the market does continue this volatile recessionary continue this volatile recessionary continue this volatile recessionary environment the mean reverting environment the mean reverting environment the mean reverting strategies will kick in and will make strategies will kick in and will make strategies will kick in and will make money and if in case the markets go back money and if in case the markets go back money and if in case the markets go back to normal and it's not volatile anymore to normal and it's not volatile anymore to normal and it's not volatile anymore uh then suddenly the other momentum or a uh then suddenly the other momentum or a uh then suddenly the other momentum or a trend following strategies goes up and trend following strategies goes up and trend following strategies goes up and then uh that strategies the long then uh that strategies the long then uh that strategies the long strategies comes into effect uh so again strategies comes into effect uh so again strategies comes into effect uh so again going back so the volatility contraction going back so the volatility contraction going back so the volatility contraction expansion there's index ETF and there's expansion there's index ETF and there's expansion there's index ETF and there's also diversification of strategy so also diversification of strategy so also diversification of strategy so there's not just one mean diverting there's not just one mean diverting there's not just one mean diverting strategies like a couple of meaning strategies like a couple of meaning strategies like a couple of meaning strategies both on the aiml end uh and strategies both on the aiml end uh and strategies both on the aiml end uh and also in the um in the normal static also in the um in the normal static also in the um in the normal static based uh strategies as well and then based uh strategies as well and then based uh strategies as well and then there's TLT and gold strategy so that is there's TLT and gold strategy so that is there's TLT and gold strategy so that is one of the most complicated AI and ML one of the most complicated AI and ML one of the most complicated AI and ML strategies that we have uh so I'm going strategies that we have uh so I'm going strategies that we have uh so I'm going to get that on here lstm coarian so it's to get that on here lstm coarian so it's to get that on here lstm coarian so it's a long short-term memory neural network a long short-term memory neural network a long short-term memory neural network with the marovitz portfolio and with the marovitz portfolio and with the marovitz portfolio and coariance model updated on this strategy coariance model updated on this strategy coariance model updated on this strategy so this basically trades the spy GLD and so this basically trades the spy GLD and so this basically trades the spy GLD and TLT at all TLT at all TLT at all times and I'll just get the results in times and I'll just get the results in times and I'll just get the results in here here here so basically what this strategy does is so basically what this strategy does is so basically what this strategy does is that it just reallocates the money to that it just reallocates the money to that it just reallocates the money to spy gold and TLT uh so based on the spy gold and TLT uh so based on the spy gold and TLT uh so based on the different market environments and based different market environments and based different market environments and based on the training data set so again you on the training data set so again you on the training data set so again you got to remember we're training across a got to remember we're training across a got to remember we're training across a specific model from 2020 and using that specific model from 2020 and using that specific model from 2020 and using that uh as an instrument to do the testing uh uh as an instrument to do the testing uh uh as an instrument to do the testing uh and this is basically the forward and this is basically the forward and this is basically the forward testing results so you can see here uh testing results so you can see here uh testing results so you can see here uh it's adapting to a TLT GLD and spy so if it's adapting to a TLT GLD and spy so if it's adapting to a TLT GLD and spy so if you can look at uh gold at this period you can look at uh gold at this period you can look at uh gold at this period of of of time you can see gold has been going up time you can see gold has been going up time you can see gold has been going up a lot so strategies like this which uh a lot so strategies like this which uh a lot so strategies like this which uh allocates your portfolio based on allocates your portfolio based on allocates your portfolio based on different market environments is always different market environments is always different market environments is always that good so again TLT as well the last that good so again TLT as well the last that good so again TLT as well the last month April month again has been month April month again has been month April month again has been volatile so so has been spy but the goal volatile so so has been spy but the goal volatile so so has been spy but the goal is essentially uh making you money and is essentially uh making you money and is essentially uh making you money and canceling out the um canceling out the canceling out the um canceling out the canceling out the um canceling out the losses from the spy so uh this one as losses from the spy so uh this one as losses from the spy so uh this one as well if you can look at the compounding well if you can look at the compounding well if you can look at the compounding annual return that's 10% with a draw annual return that's 10% with a draw annual return that's 10% with a draw down of 24% that is much higher uh than down of 24% that is much higher uh than down of 24% that is much higher uh than that of the SPY which is basically 10 that of the SPY which is basically 10 that of the SPY which is basically 10 divided by 55 uh which is. 18 so uh all divided by 55 uh which is. 18 so uh all divided by 55 uh which is. 18 so uh all our strategies has beaten the CAGR to our strategies has beaten the CAGR to our strategies has beaten the CAGR to draw down ratio of S&amp; P 500 which is 0. 18 draw down ratio of S&amp; P 500 which is 0. 18 draw down ratio of S&amp; P 500 which is 0. 18 so this LSDM strategy is 0. 46 uh the so this LSDM strategy is 0. 46 uh the so this LSDM strategy is 0. 46 uh the recurren network is 0. 49 so we've also recurren network is 0. 49 so we've also recurren network is 0. 49 so we've also got combined models like the RNN plus got combined models like the RNN plus got combined models like the RNN plus regression or the RNN plus support regression or the RNN plus support regression or the RNN plus support vector machines um so yeah so that's vector machines um so yeah so that's vector machines um so yeah so that's some of the strategies that the quans some of the strategies that the quans some of the strategies that the quans will have so all these strategies are will have so all these strategies are will have so all these strategies are run simultaneously but some strategies run simultaneously but some strategies run simultaneously but some strategies will be shut down uh when the markets will be shut down uh when the markets will be shut down uh when the markets are extremely volatile the long only are extremely volatile the long only are extremely volatile the long only strategies and then the money is strategies and then the money is strategies and then the money is reallocated to the mean reverting reallocated to the mean reverting reallocated to the mean reverting strategies and when the markets are back strategies and when the markets are back strategies and when the markets are back in you know normal trending uptrending in you know normal trending uptrending in you know normal trending uptrending move then obviously the other strategy move then obviously the other strategy move then obviously the other strategy will call for long and then you enter will call for long and then you enter will call for long and then you enter long um so again coming back to why long um so again coming back to why long um so again coming back to why we're not going to no shorts uh so as we're not going to no shorts uh so as we're not going to no shorts uh so as you can probably know you are having you can probably know you are having you can probably know you are having lots of news about margin calls uh lots of news about margin calls uh lots of news about margin calls uh across different retail traders and also across different retail traders and also across different retail traders and also hedge funds and institutional investors hedge funds and institutional investors hedge funds and institutional investors everybody is getting margin calls right everybody is getting margin calls right everybody is getting margin calls right now and uh if you're using interactive now and uh if you're using interactive now and uh if you're using interactive brokers many of them have already got a brokers many of them have already got a brokers many of them have already got a message uh saying a liquidation warning message uh saying a liquidation warning message uh saying a liquidation warning so uh the issue with this is even if so uh the issue with this is even if so uh the issue with this is even if you're protected these brokers and you're protected these brokers and you're protected these brokers and exchanges when the market is volatile exchanges when the market is volatile exchanges when the market is volatile what they do is that they increase the what they do is that they increase the what they do is that they increase the margin requirements uh they increase margin requirements uh they increase margin requirements uh they increase their portfolio margin and shorts on their portfolio margin and shorts on their portfolio margin and shorts on stocks especially have fundamentally stocks especially have fundamentally stocks especially have fundamentally higher margin requirements and they will higher margin requirements and they will higher margin requirements and they will increase it much higher so even if you increase it much higher so even if you increase it much higher so even if you think your portfolio is kind of in the think your portfolio is kind of in the think your portfolio is kind of in the green it can get a margin call and green it can get a margin call and green it can get a margin call and that's a problem with portfolio margin that's a problem with portfolio margin that's a problem with portfolio margin because of the margin increase done by because of the margin increase done by because of the margin increase done by the brokerages and exchanges again the brokerages and exchanges again the brokerages and exchanges again another thing that we teach in our another thing that we teach in our another thing that we teach in our course about the leverage we stick to course about the leverage we stick to course about the leverage we stick to minor leverage like two is to one or minor leverage like two is to one or minor leverage like two is to one or three is to one tops and that's how we three is to one tops and that's how we three is to one tops and that's how we kind of get a small tiny edge so for kind of get a small tiny edge so for kind of get a small tiny edge so for example here if you do a small leverage example here if you do a small leverage example here if you do a small leverage of two is to one we get like 20% of two is to one we get like 20% of two is to one we get like 20% compound annual return with a draw down compound annual return with a draw down compound annual return with a draw down of 48% and even then it's much better of 48% and even then it's much better of 48% and even then it's much better than the uh caggr uh to draw down of spy than the uh caggr uh to draw down of spy than the uh caggr uh to draw down of spy 500 um so we also avoid strictly 500 um so we also avoid strictly 500 um so we also avoid strictly leverage products that's also another leverage products that's also another leverage products that's also another thing that I get in lots of emails are thing that I get in lots of emails are thing that I get in lots of emails are you doing futures are you doing options you doing futures are you doing options you doing futures are you doing options are you doing forex and we always uh we are you doing forex and we always uh we are you doing forex and we always uh we always say we don't do leverage products always say we don't do leverage products always say we don't do leverage products because it's situations like this people because it's situations like this people because it's situations like this people lose a lot of money whether it's in FX lose a lot of money whether it's in FX lose a lot of money whether it's in FX fx is fundamentally most of people who fx is fundamentally most of people who fx is fundamentally most of people who trade FX are trading either on the trade FX are trading either on the trade FX are trading either on the futures uh or in the CFD brokers and futures uh or in the CFD brokers and futures uh or in the CFD brokers and they are all fundamentally leveraged they are all fundamentally leveraged they are all fundamentally leveraged products so is futures and options so products so is futures and options so products so is futures and options so you are going to get margin calls in all you are going to get margin calls in all you are going to get margin calls in all of these things so our fundamental goal of these things so our fundamental goal of these things so our fundamental goal is that to minimize as much as leverage is that to minimize as much as leverage is that to minimize as much as leverage possible from a riskmanagement possible from a riskmanagement possible from a riskmanagement perspective we are here to protect our perspective we are here to protect our perspective we are here to protect our cash and then in any upside we try to cash and then in any upside we try to cash and then in any upside we try to make money out of that so fundamentally make money out of that so fundamentally make money out of that so fundamentally the quant trading edge is pretty much the quant trading edge is pretty much the quant trading edge is pretty much boring and mechanical strategies are boring and mechanical strategies are boring and mechanical strategies are already placed uh it's very much already placed uh it's very much already placed uh it's very much diversified across trend following diversified across trend following diversified across trend following momentum mean reverting strategies gold momentum mean reverting strategies gold momentum mean reverting strategies gold TLT correlated uncorrelated you know TLT correlated uncorrelated you know TLT correlated uncorrelated you know moving the funds based on the different moving the funds based on the different moving the funds based on the different training data and testing data uh we've training data and testing data uh we've training data and testing data uh we've got a proper risk management through got a proper risk management through got a proper risk management through leverage it's not like most people think leverage it's not like most people think leverage it's not like most people think risk management is like putting a risk management is like putting a risk management is like putting a stop-loss something no the real risk stop-loss something no the real risk stop-loss something no the real risk management comes from the management comes from the management comes from the diversification of strategies and also diversification of strategies and also diversification of strategies and also the products that you trade what kind of the products that you trade what kind of the products that you trade what kind of products are you trading are you trading products are you trading are you trading products are you trading are you trading uh futures i do you know the real uh futures i do you know the real uh futures i do you know the real problem with these kind of leverage problem with these kind of leverage problem with these kind of leverage products and that is the margin products and that is the margin products and that is the margin requirements and those increase in requirements and those increase in requirements and those increase in margins can squeeze you out of all margins can squeeze you out of all margins can squeeze you out of all positions including uh your profitable positions including uh your profitable positions including uh your profitable positions uh and also it's also stress positions uh and also it's also stress positions uh and also it's also stress test across many recession periods so test across many recession periods so test across many recession periods so what we do is that during the training what we do is that during the training what we do is that during the training period we actually make sure that that period we actually make sure that that period we actually make sure that that interval has got many volatile market interval has got many volatile market interval has got many volatile market movements like for example there is the movements like for example there is the movements like for example there is the so generally what we do is that we have so generally what we do is that we have so generally what we do is that we have either a rollover training period or we either a rollover training period or we either a rollover training period or we have a fixed trading period where it's have a fixed trading period where it's have a fixed trading period where it's like from 2000 to 2010 uh so in that like from 2000 to 2010 uh so in that like from 2000 to 2010 uh so in that period we had the 2001. com bubble and period we had the 2001. com bubble and period we had the 2001. com bubble and the 2008 recession so the markets are the 2008 recession so the markets are the 2008 recession so the markets are kind of uh prepared I mean the model is kind of uh prepared I mean the model is kind of uh prepared I mean the model is kind of prepared because we trained on kind of prepared because we trained on kind of prepared because we trained on that data so for example here this is that data so for example here this is that data so for example here this is the recurring neural network strategy the recurring neural network strategy the recurring neural network strategy and if you can go into the train model and if you can go into the train model and if you can go into the train model uh it's from 2000 to 2009 December 31st uh it's from 2000 to 2009 December 31st uh it's from 2000 to 2009 December 31st where we use to train the recurring where we use to train the recurring where we use to train the recurring neural network uh but the test is on neural network uh but the test is on neural network uh but the test is on from 2010 to uh the most recent date uh from 2010 to uh the most recent date uh from 2010 to uh the most recent date uh so that's what we do so that's the so that's what we do so that's the so that's what we do so that's the advantage of machine learning models advantage of machine learning models advantage of machine learning models that we can actually feed in this crazy that we can actually feed in this crazy that we can actually feed in this crazy moments and uh the model can essentially moments and uh the model can essentially moments and uh the model can essentially train itself to prepare for these kind train itself to prepare for these kind train itself to prepare for these kind of strategies so when you say the of strategies so when you say the of strategies so when you say the strategies have a specific edge or strategies have a specific edge or strategies have a specific edge or something it's got um it's not really something it's got um it's not really something it's got um it's not really anything special it's just that the anything special it's just that the anything special it's just that the model is fundamentally trained on that model is fundamentally trained on that model is fundamentally trained on that data and we have tested it across those data and we have tested it across those data and we have tested it across those periods so now we've got a volatile periods so now we've got a volatile periods so now we've got a volatile movement right now um and that can be movement right now um and that can be movement right now um and that can be used as training for the future as well used as training for the future as well used as training for the future as well so you can imagine how much training we so you can imagine how much training we so you can imagine how much training we can get over the years and that can also can get over the years and that can also can get over the years and that can also be used as testing for example uh we can be used as testing for example uh we can be used as testing for example uh we can use the 2000 um 2010 period as training use the 2000 um 2010 period as training use the 2000 um 2010 period as training and see how it has worked in right now and see how it has worked in right now and see how it has worked in right now and if it hasn't worked that well that's and if it hasn't worked that well that's and if it hasn't worked that well that's not a good sign isn't it that's a sign not a good sign isn't it that's a sign not a good sign isn't it that's a sign that we can we can use that information that we can we can use that information that we can we can use that information to learn even better and that's that's to learn even better and that's that's to learn even better and that's that's the advantage of machine learning models the advantage of machine learning models the advantage of machine learning models that it keeps on learning uh and it that it keeps on learning uh and it that it keeps on learning uh and it depends on what you feed it as well so depends on what you feed it as well so depends on what you feed it as well so fundamentally that's the edge of the fundamentally that's the edge of the fundamentally that's the edge of the quans that they have the training and quans that they have the training and quans that they have the training and the testing data and the models are much the testing data and the models are much the testing data and the models are much more superior in learning as compared to more superior in learning as compared to more superior in learning as compared to uh maybe retail traders who are kind of uh maybe retail traders who are kind of uh maybe retail traders who are kind of new into the market and who's not new into the market and who's not new into the market and who's not equipped with the knowledge of what equipped with the knowledge of what equipped with the knowledge of what happened uh during the 2008 recession or happened uh during the 2008 recession or happened uh during the 2008 recession or how to apply uh so just to conclude on how to apply uh so just to conclude on how to apply uh so just to conclude on everything that we have discussed here everything that we have discussed here everything that we have discussed here um the key takeaways that quants do is um the key takeaways that quants do is um the key takeaways that quants do is basically they have a kill switch to basically they have a kill switch to basically they have a kill switch to move to cash um and they generally have move to cash um and they generally have move to cash um and they generally have also got mean reverting or volatility also got mean reverting or volatility also got mean reverting or volatility based strategies which kind of makes based strategies which kind of makes based strategies which kind of makes lots of money during the extreme lots of money during the extreme lots of money during the extreme volatile movements they also have a volatile movements they also have a volatile movements they also have a portfolio which has got TLT and gold portfolio which has got TLT and gold portfolio which has got TLT and gold which is trained um on recessionary which is trained um on recessionary which is trained um on recessionary environment so it can allocate capital environment so it can allocate capital environment so it can allocate capital between spy TLT and gold so in this between spy TLT and gold so in this between spy TLT and gold so in this current scenario gold is making higher current scenario gold is making higher current scenario gold is making higher highs so you're essentially making money highs so you're essentially making money highs so you're essentially making money from gold and also uh from the from gold and also uh from the from gold and also uh from the volatility based strategies if the volatility based strategies if the volatility based strategies if the volatility continues they the volatility volatility continues they the volatility volatility continues they the volatility based strategies will continue to make based strategies will continue to make based strategies will continue to make money uh and if not uh it goes back to money uh and if not uh it goes back to money uh and if not uh it goes back to the u the not goes back it goes into the the u the not goes back it goes into the the u the not goes back it goes into the long strategies where the trade signals long strategies where the trade signals long strategies where the trade signals will be generated because volatility or will be generated because volatility or will be generated because volatility or specific indicators has called for the specific indicators has called for the specific indicators has called for the markets to go uh signals to go long um markets to go uh signals to go long um markets to go uh signals to go long um so the other thing is that they use so the other thing is that they use so the other thing is that they use minimum leverage and no leverage minimum leverage and no leverage minimum leverage and no leverage products um they completely avoid products um they completely avoid products um they completely avoid futures and options and their leverage futures and options and their leverage futures and options and their leverage is like minimalistic just to beat the is like minimalistic just to beat the is like minimalistic just to beat the S&amp; P 500 by hold of 10% to 55% draw down S&amp; P 500 by hold of 10% to 55% draw down S&amp; P 500 by hold of 10% to 55% draw down maybe it's 1. 5 maybe it's two depending maybe it's 1. 5 maybe it's two depending maybe it's 1. 5 maybe it's two depending upon your risk profile and on your test upon your risk profile and on your test upon your risk profile and on your test results say uh they also don't do any results say uh they also don't do any results say uh they also don't do any shorts in stocks because the margin shorts in stocks because the margin shorts in stocks because the margin requirement issue except they do it on requirement issue except they do it on requirement issue except they do it on the index ETF and that's what mean the index ETF and that's what mean the index ETF and that's what mean reverting strategies do they do long and reverting strategies do they do long and reverting strategies do they do long and shorts on the index ETFs uh the shorts on the index ETFs uh the shorts on the index ETFs uh the strategies are previously stress tested strategies are previously stress tested strategies are previously stress tested to survive any scenario so we are to survive any scenario so we are to survive any scenario so we are actually feeding into uh the model all actually feeding into uh the model all actually feeding into uh the model all kinds of crazy volatile movements to kinds of crazy volatile movements to kinds of crazy volatile movements to actually understand how the model actually understand how the model actually understand how the model performs and to whether the model will performs and to whether the model will performs and to whether the model will survive whether the strategy will survive whether the strategy will survive whether the strategy will survive this scenario uh now all these survive this scenario uh now all these survive this scenario uh now all these things is very boring for quans and um things is very boring for quans and um things is very boring for quans and um they kind of pretty much do nothing they kind of pretty much do nothing they kind of pretty much do nothing during these volatile movements except during these volatile movements except during these volatile movements except reallocating capital or whatever the reallocating capital or whatever the reallocating capital or whatever the orders say to do that's all they do if orders say to do that's all they do if orders say to do that's all they do if it's automated if it's algorithmically it's automated if it's algorithmically it's automated if it's algorithmically uh executed then it's automatically done uh executed then it's automatically done uh executed then it's automatically done otherwise you have to do it manually i otherwise you have to do it manually i otherwise you have to do it manually i do most of my thing manually uh but do most of my thing manually uh but do most of my thing manually uh but that's it that's what quants do it's that's it that's what quants do it's that's it that's what quants do it's really boring it's really mechanical but really boring it's really mechanical but really boring it's really mechanical but it works um so hope you got the gist of it works um so hope you got the gist of it works um so hope you got the gist of what we are trying to achieve in this what we are trying to achieve in this what we are trying to achieve in this video uh thanks and have a good day
