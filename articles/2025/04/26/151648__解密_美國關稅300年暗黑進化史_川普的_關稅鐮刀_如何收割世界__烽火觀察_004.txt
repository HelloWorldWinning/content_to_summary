WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en repeat itself? In the third century AD, there was an ancient country called Palmyra on the Mediterranean coast. Palmyra had a Queen Zenobia. To this day, Queen Zenobia is still regarded as a symbol of Syrian nationalism. The Palmyra Empire under the leadership of Zenobia invaded Rome in 270 AD. Rome incorporated most of the eastern part of Rome into its territory and then annexed Egypt. A large area of ​​land from the Black Sea to the Nile River has since become the territory of Palmyra. However, soon after, the Roman Emperor Aurelian successfully regained the lost territory and besieged the capital of Palmyra, defeating Zenobia's army. The situation worsened. Zenobia escaped from the capital and headed east to seek help from the Persians. Zenobia was captured by the Romans near the Euphrates River. The Palmyra Empire was destroyed. Palmyra was also translated as Palmyra or Palmyra. The location of the city of Palmyra was in the middle of today's Syria. It was an important transit point across the Syrian desert and an important commercial center. The earliest existing tariff records are preserved in the ruins of Palmyra. The tariffs at that time were engraved on the stones of the customs wall, recording the tariffs on slaves, goods, wool, sesame oil, food and other goods entering and leaving the border. This is the first time in human history that different tariff rates have been set according to product categories. Today, the Sino-US trade war is escalating. China has returned Boeing aircraft ordered from the United States as the latest retaliation for US tariffs. US President Trump seems to have softened his stance on China, claiming that he has significantly lowered tariffs. In fact, high tariffs have always been a traditional way to protect fiscal revenue in the history of the United States. Trade wars are nothing new. The United States has already experienced tariff wars with major European trading partners by raising tariffs, sometimes over automobiles. There have been trade disputes over cars and home appliances, sometimes over sugar, tea, and even chicken. From the colonies to the present day, in about three hundred (four) years, there have been no less than seven or eight tariff wars of a certain scale. What interesting history is there? Let’s talk about it today. Let’s talk about this. When mentioning “colonization”, most Chinese people will frown. Influenced by early ideologies, Chinese people are full of resentment towards the Western powers’ invasion of their country after 1840 described in history textbooks. Colonization, colonizer, and colonialism have become derogatory terms. In fact, this matter must be viewed separately. Colonialism must be opposed because it involves a certain degree of aggression. However, colonization and colonists are essentially people who leave their hometowns to establish new homes in other places in order to make a living. The Indians grabbed some gold and silver from the Indians. By the mid-17th century, the British North American colonies gradually became the most economically developed American colonies. So why could their land develop so rapidly? Because the British had the least control over the North American colonies. When the British packaged and shipped these people to North America by express delivery, they originally had the attitude of letting them fend for themselves. Therefore, the British king was neither able nor embarrassed to ask for too many taxes and services from the colonial people. In order to encourage more "unstable factors" to go to North America, the British even introduced a A series of extremely preferential policies, such as tax exemptions for the import and export of agricultural and sideline products. For example, you can obtain land by cultivating land for a few years under a contract, and you basically don't have to bear the cost of national defense and administration. Each state generally has one governor, a few officials, and a small number of police officers. There are very few civil servants. These policies have greatly stimulated people's enthusiasm and made them more motivated to improve the quality of the land. Businessmen in North America can also enjoy many benefits. The same is true for doing business. In the UK, you have to pay taxes according to law. When you arrive in North America, you don't have to pay taxes. Why is it treated so differently? Because North America is almost autonomous. Compared with the British mainland, the level of tax paid to the British government was only 2% of the tax paid by the people in the North American colonies. Even the tax money came and went from there. The British mainland finance took no money and all was used for the construction and defense of the North American colonies. It can be said that the North American colonists during this period were indeed the best-paid overseas residents in the British Empire. However, it was not long before the French established a huge colony in the center of North America. The British colonists wanted to look westward for a larger area of ​​land. These two groups competed with the Indians. Conflicts arose due to reasons such as the fur trade. Britain and France then fought a war around the North American colonies. The result was that the French lost and the British won. However, the situation after the victory was not optimistic. For the British in North America, after the war, they obtained a large amount of land in the west. The trade routes were smooth and free, and they made a lot of money. However, the British on the mainland paid a huge amount of manpower and material resources. The cost of the war was a huge debt, which earned face, but in fact no benefits were gained. Some people began to murmur that the country bumpkins in North America could not be allowed to bear some of the national debt in a reasonable and reasonable manner. So after defeating the French, the British government announced a ban on further immigration to the west. After we had planned the land and formulated policies, we took the first blow to the North American colonists. The broad masses of the people went to enjoy the fruits of victory, but the North American businessmen said to go and have fun. This was a conspiracy. Complaints continued one after another and were followed by another knife. In order to fill the famine caused by the war as soon as possible, in 1764, the British Parliament passed the "Honey Act" and required a tax on honey and sugar cubes imported into the colonies. Why tax honey first? This matter and people at that time Regarding living habits, both North Americans and Europeans in the 18th century liked to drink. In the New World, rum was a particularly popular drink. To make rum, honey must be used as a raw material. So where does honey come from? The ones relatively close to North America include the British West Indies and the French West Indies. The British cane sugar production is low and the price is high. The French have reasonable prices and large quantities. Merchants in North America were willing to import honey from the French West Indies. From the perspective of merchants, this was reasonable and reasonable, but France was an enemy country. How could we just forget about hatred? So the British planters began to agitate and go to the British Parliament together, hoping that the Lord Qingtian would make the decision for them. After singing patriotic hymns with tears and singing, the "Honey Act" came out. It seems reasonable, because there was already a tax on honey before. The tax rate at that time was 6 pence per gallon of honey. North American businessmen felt that the tax was too heavy and they evaded the tax. After the new bill was introduced, the tax rate was lowered to 3 pence per gallon. The government called on people not to evade taxes. Paying taxes according to the law is the obligation of every citizen. In order to implement the tax, the King of England sent a large number of tax officials to North America. It is stipulated that honey cannot be imported from other countries and transported back and forth. You must rent a British ship, and the captain must be British. Logically speaking, the 3 pence tax rate was not high at the time. The key is not that there is more money, but that this thing makes people in North America feel unfair. The young mother was picky and old-fashioned, and she had to come to collect alimony every three days. After the "Honey Act", there was the stamp tax of 1765 and the "Townshend Act" of 1767. Thus, the most expensive "tea show" in history, the Boston Tea Party, began. The tax burden was like a cup of bitter wine, which made it difficult for the North American colonists to swallow. They quickly thought of a counterattack strategy. What strategy? The boycott of tea was originally a honey dispute, so why did it become involved in tea? This is because the person who proposed this law in 1767 was named Charlie Townsend, so he named it after him. The Townshend Act stipulated that all glass, paint, paper, tea, etc. imported into the colonies must be taxed. The Townshend Act quickly encountered fierce opposition from the colonies and gradually developed into violent confrontation, which directly led to 1770. In the Boston Massacre of 2009, nine British soldiers opened fire on hundreds of people, resulting in five deaths and many injured. The British Parliament had no choice but to amend the bill in 1773 to only tax tea. Can't you just exempt all others? The export business of North America is also very large. For example, rum was an important commodity exported to Europe at that time. The British Parliament naively thought that the people in North America were mainly opposed to taxes on goods exported from North America. They should not be so disgusted with imported goods. Things are expensive, so if you don’t buy it, it will end. However, tea has been integrated into people’s daily lives. It is really important to have a cup of black tea with sugar and milk every day. Tea is even more exciting than rum, whether it is tea or sugar cubes. There has been a huge demand in North America, and now there is a sudden tax on the tea imported to North America. On the surface, it is a tax on the East India Company. But everyone on earth knows that the East India Company has a monopoly on all tea business. The wool is produced on the sheep. The tax has been imposed on the selling price of the tea. You have to buy it or not. Every sip of tea is a blood transfusion for the mother country. All British citizens are taxed. How come living in the UK is tax-free? Living in North America has to pay extra? This is so unfair and must be boycotted collectively! But without the sweetness of hot tea, life becomes dull and boring, what should I do if there is no fun? This one is expensive, so just buy it from another one. What a coincidence, the Dutch also opened an East India Company. What's even more coincidental is that this company also sells tea. What's even better is that this company's tea is high quality and low price without adding taxes, and the service attitude is good. Smuggling tea from the Dutch is as easy as smuggling honey from the French. People in North America are not affected by this, enjoying sweetened black tea while continuing to make rum and export to make money. Smuggling made the British East India Company run out of breath and anger. Batches of tea bought from China at high prices gradually piled up on the coastal docks, and then slowly became moldy and spoiled. No one cared about this transaction, but the loss went to grandma's house. The King of England and the British Parliament said that this was a naked betrayal and shameless. I don't know who issued a petition. They gritted their teeth and stamped their feet and began to subsidize the East India Company's tea trade in North America. Do you think this is retaliation by crows? It seems that the logic is a bit confusing. The British ignore this and let the tea exported to North America be sold at a price lower than that of the Dutch East India Company. The smugglers' smuggled tea sells for about 2 shillings and 1 pence per pound. The British East India Company's tea directly sells for 2 shillings after subsidies. This price war has angered the "smugglers" in North America and uses government actions to beat the high to the low. This is completely to cause these " The smuggling enterprise's strategy of killing the tea tax was instigated by North American merchants or under the perverse actions of the British Parliament. The colonial movement to resist the tea tax intensified. In November 1773, three British merchant ships loaded with tea entered the Boston Harbor. Local people began to organize organized gatherings. There was no way to get the tea ashore. The governor at the time, Hutchinson, was also a ruthless character. It was stipulated that tea ships were not allowed to leave the port without unloading. The two sides were at a stalemate. Finally, on the night of December 16th, when the moon was dark and the wind was high, about a hundred people dressed as Indians rushed to the dock with hammers and axes. They boarded the cargo ship and clearly divided their labors. Within three hours, they poured all 342 boxes of tea into the cold sea. In a moment, tea leaves were flying all over the sky, tea residues were splashing on the sea, and even seabirds were stunned. Looking from a distance, the entire water surface of Boston Harbor was dyed brown-green. What’s interesting is that this group of people were quite ethical and only destroyed tea leaves. The scattered other goods on the ship were all intact. One buddy stole the tea leaves and stuffed them into his pockets. He was immediately stripped and thrown off the ship. The next day, people found floating tea residues up to half a meter thick in some places. The locals joked that this was enough to turn the entire sea into black tea. When the news came back to the British Parliament, the gentlemen were so angry that they stopped drinking their afternoon tea and quickly responded with a series of "Intolerable Acts" The British closed the Port of Boston and strengthened their military presence. They hoped that through coercive laws, they could isolate radicals. The result was a perfect example of what "adding fuel to the fire" meant. The more they suppressed, the more people in the colonies united, and the conflicts between the two sides became more and more acute. Finally, two years later, the settlers in each colony formed the first Continental Congress. The Continental Congress established the Continental Association. This time, not only tea, but all British goods were boycotted. The colonists began to organize their own independence. Two years later, in July 1776, the American Revolution officially began with militia armed forces. The American Revolutionary War completely broke out until September 3, 1783, when the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from Britain through the Declaration of Independence. The War of Independence ended with the defeat of the British and the peace negotiation. The United States became independent, but the taxes that should be paid still had to be paid. However, the name changed, because without the taxes of the people, it is difficult for a country to operate. The emerging United States of America had just been established and owed a lot of famine and the British war for several years. The country owed a total debt of 77 million U. S. dollars, which doesn't sound like much. Don't forget that this was in the 18th century. 12 million of these debts were owed to foreign governments and foreign banks, 20 million were owed by the country to various states, and the rest were all owed to ordinary Americans. The situation of bonds in the hands of ordinary Americans is more complicated. Many people can't wait. And the government has sold the bonds to speculators to pay back the money. The first President Washington handed a letter of appointment as Secretary of the Treasury to Hamilton. Hamilton, an American fiscal scientist, military general, founding father, and political philosopher, one of the drafters of the United States Constitution, the first U. S. Secretary of the Treasury. In order to repay the debt, some people led by Hamilton advocated repaying the debt owed at face value, whether it was in the hands of ordinary people or speculative. In our words, in the hands of businessmen, this is called debt repayment. It is natural that only by repaying debts in full can the government establish its credibility in the hearts of the people. Always trying to find ways to dig into the money of its own people is purely shameless behavior. However, another wave of people, led by Secretary of State Jefferson, expressed opposition. They believed that speculators could not easily profit like this. More importantly, Jefferson saw that such a repayment plan would increase the power of the federal government. It would pose a threat to various states and the people. Both sides came and went. In the end, they chose to take a step back. Jefferson agreed with Hamilton to establish a central bank and issue paper money with government credit to pay off debts. Hamilton gave up the proposal to locate the capital in New York and agreed to build the capital closer to the south in Washington. Banks alone are not enough. Taxation is a must for the long-term good operation of the government. Every country has tariffs. Hamilton proposed that the United States of America should also impose tariffs. Tariffs are a double-edged sword. Imposing tariffs will inevitably lead to trade wars with other countries. At that time, the United States was still an agricultural country that mainly exported agricultural products. A trade war would harm the interests of southern farmers and plantation owners. But without tariffs, the government would have no stable income except for tariffs. , Hamilton also targeted an emerging alcoholic beverage called whiskey and pushed Congress to pass relevant resolutions to begin levying a federal tax on grain alcoholic beverages. This tax also caused a lot of controversy and riots. Farmers turned the remaining grain into wine and then sold the wine to make money. But suddenly the government said that from now on, we must also share People expressed their opposition and often refused to pay taxes. It was not easy for President Washington to send people to collect taxes. The newly appointed tax collectors were tarred and feathered and paraded through the streets. The farmers' dissatisfaction gradually developed into a large-scale anti-tax movement. Washington told the protesters: If there is a problem, go to the court. The farmers said no: If there is a problem, The direct anti-tax movement evolved into an armed riot. The authority of the federal government was fully challenged. At this time, Hamilton suggested that Washington send troops to suppress it. Washington ordered 15, 000 troops to personally go to suppress the riot. In the process of suppressing the rebellion, several people died. Fortunately, the situation did not escalate. In the end, the two sides negotiated peacefully. In the end, the authority of the federal government was preserved and tax revenue was guaranteed through force. In wars, there are often two reasons. One is on the stage and the other is off the stage. As for why the conflict broke out, both sides in the American Civil War held different opinions. People in the north said that we were to liberate all mankind, especially to liberate the South. The big black slaves, while people in the south argued tit for tat, saying that the U. S. Constitution did not have provisions related to the abolition of slavery. Northern morality kidnapped the South, which itself was immoral. These reasons have been passed down. Nowadays, historians are paying more and more attention to the reasons behind the table that have not been publicized. Tariffs are the real reason that plunged the United States into four years of civil war. Tariffs, to put it bluntly, close the door to the country. All goods that want to come in must pay taxes. In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the United States had a typical agricultural economy and the manufacturing industry was not developed. After the threat of the British army faded away, the manufacturing industry in the United States began to take off. Although a number of workers emerged. However, compared with European countries, the production costs and prices of American manufacturing companies are high and uncompetitive. How to protect and support these "national industries"? The most direct way is to impose protective tariffs and impose high tariffs on imported goods to raise their prices so that they cannot compete with local products. In the 19th century, the United States China's tariffs experienced two peaks. In the 1830s, the average tariff rate reached more than 50%. In the second peak in the 1870s, tariffs also exceeded 40%. The emerging manufacturing industry was mainly concentrated in the north. Congress was also controlled by northern representatives, so the tariffs began to rise steadily. The northerners were naturally ecstatic because since then The utensils produced in China have more price advantages and double the profits. However, the southerners are not happy because the tariff war is not just a one-way move. Raising tariffs on the United States will inevitably lead to European retaliation. The consequence of this confrontation is that U. S. exports will be subject to additional taxes in the European market. So what was the main force of U. S. exports that year? They are agricultural products produced in the South, such as tobacco and cotton. British gentlemen like American tobacco. Almost all factories in Europe purchase American cotton. The result of the tariff war is that the North benefits and the South suffers. Such tariffs are obviously extremely unfair. South Carolina reacted the most violently. They declared the tariff bill invalid in the state and began to raise military expenditures and prepare troops. This was dissatisfaction with the tariff policy. It was clear that a separate central government was to be established. In 1832, President Jackson at the time ordered eight warships to block the South Carolina seaport. Using force to force the states to submit in front of the gunboats, the South was forced to make concessions and could only see its own cotton and tobacco crumbling in Europe. The South also tried to fight for it through Congress and once saw the light of day in 1846. The president who supported the South passed a new tariff system and lowered the tariff from 24% to 15%. The tariff was lowered, but government taxes increased. Before the Civil War, in 1845, the tariffs were reduced. The highest U. S. tariff revenue was US$27. 5 million. In 1855, the tariff rate was reduced to 20%, but the revenue rose to 53 million. In 1860, the tariff was reduced to 15%, and the revenue remained at 53. 2 million. This was mainly because the reduction in tariffs stimulated bilateral trade. Both the southern farmers and the US government were happy. However, for the northerners who produced industrial products, it was "unjust like a bolt from the blue. " After the tax reduction, European industrial products returned to the U. S. market in droves. The crudely manufactured products of the northerners could no longer deceive their own people. Even if they shouted to love the motherland and support domestic products, they could not be sold. The government spoiled some people. This kind of history has always repeated itself over and over again. It is not an exaggeration to say that the northerners have been thinking about this and tried every means to regain control of the U. S. government. They really succeeded. In 1860, the Northern-controlled Congress passed a new tariff law. This new bill was called the "Morrill Tariff Act. " The tariff rate was set at 37. 5%. In that era, this was no longer a tax. It was an obvious conflict between the North and the South. In November 1860, Lincoln, who advocated the abolition of slavery and high tariffs, was successfully elected as the President of the United States. A month later, he took the lead for the last time. The troubled South Carolina once again took the lead in launching an attack and officially announced its withdrawal from the Union. The other six southern states followed closely. Two days before Lincoln took office, the Morrill Tariff Act was passed and implemented. The tragic Civil War broke out randomly. Lincoln became a deeply hated figure by southerners and was assassinated after the war. In fact, although Lincoln supported high tariffs, the Morrill Tariff Act was not Lincoln's original creation. He just happened to stand in the moment when the contradiction was most acute. As soon as the Civil War broke out in the crater, both the South and the North immediately faced a financial crisis. In fact, a serious economic crisis broke out in the United States long before the war. A large number of foreign capital evacuated the local economy. The local economy was in depression. The federal government was in a panic and resorted to medical treatment. It could only make up for the deficit through high tariffs. This was also one of the important reasons for the passage of the Morrill Tariff Act. After the end of the war, the United States' high tariff policy was continued. "Flying at high altitudes" It was not until 1910 that the tariff rate was lowered again. It was during this period that the United States achieved rapid industrialization and economic growth. Therefore, there is a voice to this day that it is the high tariffs that protected the national industry of the United States, allowing them to accumulate their first pot of gold. Then through technological transformation, they finally defeated the established European powers. The industrial economy was booming, and electrification drove factories across the United States. Productivity surged, motor vehicles replaced horses and mules, and the land originally used to raise horses and mules was liberated, resulting in a rapid surplus of agricultural products. People's incomes increased, but they could never keep up with productivity. Therefore, Senator Smoot came up with a proposal and said that we should raise import tariffs to absorb excess production capacity. Some economists and business leaders immediately objected, saying that we have now maintained trade. By the end of 1929, as the global economy entered the first stage of the Great Depression, the main goal of the U. S. government was: to preserve jobs, protect farms, and protect farmers from the impact of trade. Smoot began to advocate higher tariffs, which eventually evolved into the infamous "Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. " Smoot himself was a Utah Republican and a senator. Chairman of the Finance Committee Hawley is an Oregon Republican who serves as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Although more than 1, 000 economists and business leaders signed a petition asking then-President Hoover to veto the tariff bill, due to the influence of the Republican Party and cabinet members, Hoover finally signed it into effect, imposing a tariff of more than 50% on nearly 2, 000 categories of imported goods. Immediately after the tariff bill came into effect, it triggered strong reactions from major U. S. trading partners. Ten of them took retaliatory measures against the United States. France levied high taxes and fees on U. S. -made cars. The United Kingdom protested and developed new trading partners. Canada, the most loyal and good neighbor, imposed new tariffs on 16 types of U. S. goods. Italy and Switzerland even called for a boycott of U. S. goods. In response to retaliatory measures and economic Under the dual pressure of the Great Depression, the U. S. economy suffered a heavy blow. Export trade dropped by 60% in the following years, and the unemployment rate jumped from 8% to 25%. It was not until 1934 that the newly elected President Roosevelt repealed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and replaced it with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which stipulated that the president could directly contact each country's trading partners without going through Congress, and had special privileges in negotiating tax cuts. At that time, the U. S. economy took a breather. The "Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act" was like a large-scale closed experiment for commercial activities. It closed the door tightly and stimulated domestic demand. It only focused on expecting local industries to take off and protect it. As a result, the entire economic system became a pot of porridge. Trade was broken, and agriculture and industry suffered. Historically, U. S. tariffs have been higher than those of Britain, France and other European developed countries for a long time. As mentioned before, tariffs are not only on the U. S. Important fiscal revenue is sometimes used to protect domestic industries in the United States. During the Great Depression, tariffs became a powerful medicine for the United States to stimulate the domestic economy. Unfortunately, people used too much force at the wrong time, which ultimately backfired. After World War II, the United States has been pursuing a low-tariff system with an average tariff of less than 10%, and the economy has continued to grow. There are exceptions to this situation, such as in the 1960s. Chicken War" After World War II, the "poultry industry" in the United States suddenly became popular. Chicken raising was no longer a small business but an assembly line operation in large factories. Chicken production increased steadily, and the price of chicken dropped accordingly. Don't underestimate this change. Before the 1960s, eating chicken was a luxury all over the world, including in Europe. However, in the United States, chicken was already a common meal among the American people. Cheap chicken began to be exported to Europe in large quantities. In 1961, West Germany's per capita chicken consumption in Europe soared by 23%. Half of the chicken on the market was "originated in the United States. " This was the pace to drive out all the native chickens in Europe. Seeing the flood of chicken, Europeans quickly came up with countermeasures. Some countries, including France and West Germany, began to impose "high tariffs" on American chicken. By August 1962, the sales of chicken exported by the United States to Europe dropped by 25%. The U. S. poultry industry suffered heavy losses. Both sides blamed each other and used diplomatic mediation. In 1963, then U. S. President Lyndon Johnson announced a 25% tariff on imported potato starch, dextrin, brandy, and light trucks in response to Europe. The high import tax on U. S. chicken is the so-called "chicken tax. " Even a small piece of chicken can reflect the joys and troubles of global trade. Coincidentally, in the 1970s, the Nixon administration imposed a temporary surcharge on imported goods starting in 1993. Trade sanctions caused by bananas are all typical cases related to high tariff policies. During this period, it is necessary to talk about the conflict between the US and Japan in semiconductors and manufacturing that occurred in the 1980s. After Japan was defeated in World War II, Japan received defense guarantees from the United States. At the same time, the United States encouraged Japan's industrial and economic development to check communism in Asia. However, this move was a bit too strong. Japan transformed into a high-end manufacturing export powerhouse, and became a world-class brand in automobiles and electronic products by the mid-1980s. The U. S. trade deficit with Japan has exceeded 40 billion U. S. dollars, accounting for one-third of the U. S. total trade deficit. Local companies were severely beaten by the Japanese. The economy began to enter recession and the unemployment rate went straight to 10%. Gradually, the U. S. began to worry about Japan's economic dominance. We sell movies, hamburgers, cars, and televisions. How can we stand it? The U. S. government began to take corresponding measures. The first step was to negotiate and sign the "Plaza Accord" with the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, and France, and use the strategy of currency intervention to depreciate the U. S. dollar. The second step was to Japan. A "defensive" tariff war was launched. Some Japanese goods were levied 100% tariffs. So how did Japan respond back then? The Japanese said that we should not make big concessions in signing a series of trade agreements with the United States. Unfortunately, the trade war can only treat the symptoms but not the root cause. The U. S. deficit with Japan is still alarmingly high. In the end, the bursting of Japan's economic bubble solved this problem, which also led to Japan's economic stagnation for more than ten years. Looking at the U. S. -Japan trade conflict, will the history of today's U. S. -China trade war U. S. President Donald John Trump Trump) was born in the German-American Trump family in New York. He was a media celebrity and entrepreneur in his early years and is now an international figure. In his first presidential term in 2017, Trump began to put pressure on Chinese goods through tariffs. In his second term in 2025, the tariffs directly soared to the highest tax rate since the Great Depression. The China-China trade war is still going on. So far, no party is giving up. Trump has imposed an import tax of up to 145% on Chinese goods entering the United States, while China has increased taxes on American products by 125%. Trump is a leader with great personality. Some scholars have commented that Trump is a thoughtful person in both economic theory and international relations theory. Thinking of people living in the 19th century, mercantilism, high tariffs, and trade protection seem to be lingering in his mind. Since the 1980s when he became famous, increasing tariffs has been Trump’s mantra. He has said that he would increase tariffs on Japan, Mexico, Canada, South Korea, and China. , adding European tariffs. In short, tariffs can solve everything. To this day, the "universal tax increases" and highly targeted "reciprocal barriers" promoted by Trump are not so much tariffs as trade deficit penalties. So, is it possible to rewrite the structure of the global market that has been maintained for more than 30 years through administrative means? It is obvious that the current global economic system is fundamentally different from that of the 1970s or earlier. Today's supply chains are highly integrated across borders. A product is likely to be designed in Silicon Valley, with parts coming from Germany and assembled in Mexico. A complete product line often spans several time zones and high tariffs. Not only does it increase import costs, it will also hurt domestic manufacturers and the ultimate market competitiveness. Therefore, although Trump’s tariff stick will not immediately bring the United States back to the scene of national famine like the Great Depression, it is likely to bring the economy into a cycle of high costs, high inflation, and low confidence, which is the so-called vicious circle. Stagnant inflation China has recently denied it is in active talks with U. S. President Donald Trump's administration over tariffs and said any talk of progress is groundless. Meanwhile, despite Beijing's denials, Trump has said talks on the trade war are still ongoing. Since Trump first announced the tariffs on April 2 this year, trans-Pacific shipping cancellations have increased sixfold. Container throughput at major ports in the United States from China has dropped sharply. Some logistics personnel said that bookings have dropped by 60%. The situation of U. S. exports to China has also worsened. This situation is worsening under tariffs. The announcement comes after the number of empty containers leaving Los Angeles increased by 23% in March. The overall order volume is close to the level in April 2020, when the epidemic led to the national lockdown. A US media said that recent events show that China is far more prepared to decouple from the United States than the United States. The future direction of the trade war between the United States and China is still full of variables. Welcome everyone to leave your opinions in the comment area. Read history and know good and evil.
