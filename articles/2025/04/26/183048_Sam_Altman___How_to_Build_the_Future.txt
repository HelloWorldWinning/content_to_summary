added one always loved and I've since added one more element to it but the quote is that more element to it but the quote is that more element to it but the quote is that the way things get done in the world are the way things get done in the world are the way things get done in the world are through a combination of focus and through a combination of focus and through a combination of focus and personal connection and the additional personal connection and the additional personal connection and the additional point I would make after having thought point I would make after having thought point I would make after having thought about it for a while is that the third about it for a while is that the third about it for a while is that the third factor is self belief it's you really factor is self belief it's you really factor is self belief it's you really have to have a deep-seated personal have to have a deep-seated personal have to have a deep-seated personal conviction that this thing you're going conviction that this thing you're going conviction that this thing you're going to do that a lot of people say is really to do that a lot of people say is really to do that a lot of people say is really stupid is going to work and going to be stupid is going to work and going to be stupid is going to work and going to be important but I think those three things important but I think those three things important but I think those three things focus personal connections and self focus personal connections and self focus personal connections and self belief in my experience are how things belief in my experience are how things belief in my experience are how things get done in the world so since you were get done in the world so since you were get done in the world so since you were you know as long as you know you've you know as long as you know you've you know as long as you know you've you've grown up and certainly three or you've grown up and certainly three or you've grown up and certainly three or 20s and now you've worked incredibly 20s and now you've worked incredibly 20s and now you've worked incredibly hard and I know that a lot of the people hard and I know that a lot of the people hard and I know that a lot of the people around you have worked very hard what's around you have worked very hard what's around you have worked very hard what's sort of the advice or the way that you sort of the advice or the way that you sort of the advice or the way that you think about your work-life balance in think about your work-life balance in think about your work-life balance in your 20s and what do you recommend to your 20s and what do you recommend to your 20s and what do you recommend to people who want to do these things and people who want to do these things and people who want to do these things and also want to you know experience their also want to you know experience their also want to you know experience their 20s well I don't think I work as hard to 20s well I don't think I work as hard to 20s well I don't think I work as hard to a lot of people I think I do work pretty a lot of people I think I do work pretty a lot of people I think I do work pretty hard um but I'd say it's really I think hard um but I'd say it's really I think hard um but I'd say it's really I think it's compound interest is a good it's compound interest is a good it's compound interest is a good metaphor here if you work really hard at metaphor here if you work really hard at metaphor here if you work really hard at the beginning of your career and you get the beginning of your career and you get the beginning of your career and you get a little bit better what you do every a little bit better what you do every a little bit better what you do every day every week every year and you learn day every week every year and you learn day every week every year and you learn more and you meet more people and you more and you meet more people and you more and you meet more people and you just get more done um there's a compound just get more done um there's a compound just get more done um there's a compound effect and it's far better to put that effect and it's far better to put that effect and it's far better to put that time in at the beginning time in at the beginning time in at the beginning career then at the end because if you do career then at the end because if you do career then at the end because if you do at the beginning you get to benefit from at the beginning you get to benefit from at the beginning you get to benefit from it you know for the rest of the time you it you know for the rest of the time you it you know for the rest of the time you work so you know one thing I always try work so you know one thing I always try work so you know one thing I always try to do is like meet every person I had to do is like meet every person I had to do is like meet every person I had time for go to every you know go to time for go to every you know go to time for go to every you know go to everything I could and just like spend a everything I could and just like spend a everything I could and just like spend a little bit more time trying to learn and little bit more time trying to learn and little bit more time trying to learn and get better what I did what I do and I get better what I did what I do and I get better what I did what I do and I think that is really valuable um the you think that is really valuable um the you think that is really valuable um the you know the beginning of your career I know the beginning of your career I know the beginning of your career I think in terms of studying the think in terms of studying the think in terms of studying the trajectory that the rest of your career trajectory that the rest of your career trajectory that the rest of your career follows is the most valuable time and so follows is the most valuable time and so follows is the most valuable time and so obviously you don't want to work all the obviously you don't want to work all the obviously you don't want to work all the time because your twenties your twenties time because your twenties your twenties time because your twenties your twenties but I do think you want to work harder but I do think you want to work harder but I do think you want to work harder than most people think you should and I than most people think you should and I than most people think you should and I think that if you do that you tend to think that if you do that you tend to think that if you do that you tend to benefit from it later life is super benefit from it later life is super benefit from it later life is super unfair sometimes you also just get unfair sometimes you also just get unfair sometimes you also just get unlucky and and so all you can do is unlucky and and so all you can do is unlucky and and so all you can do is kind of maximize chances there but I do kind of maximize chances there but I do kind of maximize chances there but I do think that working hard early in your think that working hard early in your think that working hard early in your career to get the leverage and the career to get the leverage and the career to get the leverage and the compounding effects is underrated and compounding effects is underrated and compounding effects is underrated and one of the most valuable piece of advice one of the most valuable piece of advice one of the most valuable piece of advice that I never got and so going into that that I never got and so going into that that I never got and so going into that idea of these early years being idea of these early years being idea of these early years being particularly valuable and working very particularly valuable and working very particularly valuable and working very hard on things how do you decide when hard on things how do you decide when hard on things how do you decide when you've worked on something long enough you've worked on something long enough you've worked on something long enough and it's time to call it quits or when and it's time to call it quits or when and it's time to call it quits or when you've worked on it for four years and you've worked on it for four years and you've worked on it for four years and you're just about to have that you're just about to have that you're just about to have that breakthrough how do you make that breakthrough how do you make that breakthrough how do you make that distinction yeah this this is really distinction yeah this this is really distinction yeah this this is really hard um knowing when to quit and knowing hard um knowing when to quit and knowing hard um knowing when to quit and knowing when to give up on something is there's when to give up on something is there's when to give up on something is there's no perfect answer to that but it's no perfect answer to that but it's no perfect answer to that but it's really challenging to even get that really challenging to even get that really challenging to even get that approximately correct I think most approximately correct I think most approximately correct I think most people give up on things way too early people give up on things way too early people give up on things way too early so the mistake that most people make is so the mistake that most people make is so the mistake that most people make is they try something it does not they try something it does not they try something it does not immediately work you see this immediately work

the satirical version of this you know the satirical version of this is people that are 23 and have started is people that are 23 and have started is people that are 23 and have started 14 startups because they give up on 14 startups because they give up on 14 startups because they give up on everyone before I could ever possibly everyone before I could ever possibly everyone before I could ever

going to who say this thing sucks it's going to who say this thing sucks it's going to fail it's really stupid and then also fail it's really stupid and then also fail it's really stupid and then also there's like what at YC we call the there's like what at YC we call the there's like what at YC we call the trough of sorrow where no one even trough of sorrow where no one even trough of sorrow where no one even bothers to say it sucks because no one bothers to say it sucks because no one bothers to say it sucks because no one cares at all cares at all cares at all um and that is at least is demotivating um and that is at least is demotivating um and that is at least is demotivating most of the founders that I have spent a most of the founders that I have spent a most of the founders that I have spent a lot of time with that have gone on to be lot of time with that have gone on to be lot of time with that have gone on to be super successful spent a very long time super successful spent

and either people would have given up and either people would have given up and either people said it sucks or people said nothing at said it sucks or people said nothing at said it sucks or people said nothing at all and a framework that I have for when all and a framework that I have for when all and a framework that I have for when to go up and when to keep working is it to go up and when to keep working is it to go up and when to keep working is it should be an internal not an external should be an internal not an external should be an internal not an external decision if people aren't using it or decision if people aren't using it or decision if people aren't using it or people are saying it's bad that alone is people are saying it's bad that alone is people are saying it's bad that alone is not a reason to give up you want to pay not a reason to give up you want to pay not a reason to give up you want to pay some attention to that they might be some attention to that they might be some attention to that they might be right but I think the best entrepreneurs right but I think the best entrepreneurs right but I think the best entrepreneurs I know they make an internal

working on something it's basically when working on something it's basically when working on something it's basically when you have run out of ideas and something you have run out of ideas and something you have run out of ideas and something is not working then it's a good time to is not working then it's a good time to is not working then it's a good time to stop and so into this idea that you need stop and so into this idea that you need stop and so into this idea that you need a long time to do anything important a long time to do anything important a long time to do anything important what's the source of motivation for what's the source of motivation for what's the source of motivation for people like what should people be people like what should people be people like

bad things long period of time that the bad things long period of time that the bad things happen over and so the only motivation happen over and so the only motivation happen over and so the only motivation that I have seen work for people over a that I have seen work for people over a that I have seen work for people over a long period of time is enjoyment and long period of time is enjoyment and long period of time is enjoyment and what they're doing and an intense belief what they're doing and an intense belief what they're doing and an intense belief that it matters and ideally liking the that it matters and ideally liking the that it matters and ideally liking the people that they go to work with every people that they go to work with every people that they go to work with every

doesn't motivate me at all but it's honestly not a big factor all but it's honestly not a big factor all but it's honestly not a big factor at this point yeah I just sort of like at this point yeah I just sort of like at this point yeah I just sort of like there's a set of things that I think are there's a set of things that I think are there's a set of things that I think are important and I want to work on this I important and I want to work on this I important and I want to work on this I think another point about motivation think another point about motivation think another point about motivation that is that people don't talk about that is that people don't talk about that is that people don't talk about enough is related to burnout so I was enough is related to burnout so I was enough is related to burnout so I was told and I thought for a long time that told and I thought for a long time that told and I thought for a long time that you get burned out from working too hard you get burned out from working too hard you get burned out from working too hard and at least in my own experience what I and at least in my own experience what I and at least in my own experience what I found is that burnout actually comes found is that burnout actually comes found is that burnout actually comes from failing and things not working from failing and things not working from failing and things not working momentum is really energizing the lack momentum is really energizing the lack momentum is really energizing the lack of momentum is super draining and I find of momentum is super draining and I find of momentum is super draining and I find that I have infinite energy to work on that I have infinite energy to work on that I have infinite energy to work on things that I find interesting and that things that I find interesting and that things that I find interesting and that are working and almost none to work on are working and almost none to work on are working and almost none to work on things that I either don't find things that I either don't find things that I either don't find interesting or aren't working and so I interesting or aren't working and so I interesting or aren't working and so I think you see a lot of founders try think you see a lot of founders try think you see a lot of founders try something and fail and assume that they something and fail and assume that they something and fail and assume that they just can't work hard enough or not just can't work hard enough or not just can't work hard enough or not amount of energy or passion or whatever amount of energy or passion or whatever amount of energy or passion or whatever and that's actually not true it's just and that's actually not true it's just and that's actually not true it's just that that thing didn't work and what you that that thing didn't work and what you that that thing didn't work and what you should do is shut that company down go should do is shut that company down go should do is shut that company down go on vacation and try again and many on vacation and try again and many on vacation and try again and many people then find that oh actually when people then find that oh actually when people then find that oh actually when I'm doing this thing that I like and I'm doing this thing that I like and I'm doing this thing that I like and that is working I have a huge amount of that is working I have a huge amount of that is working I have a huge amount of energy and I can get a lot of stuff done energy and I can get a lot of stuff done energy and I can get a lot of stuff done and so when you look at really and so when you look at really and so when you look at really successful people and say how do they successful people and say how do they successful people and say how do they get all those things done it's they have get all those things done it's they have get all those things done it's they have the benefit of momentum and momentum is the benefit of momentum and momentum is the benefit of momentum and momentum is energizing in the lack of momentum is energizing in the lack of momentum is energizing in the lack of momentum is really not energizing working on a lot really not energizing working on a lot really not energizing working on a lot of these problems that you know kind of of these problems that you know kind of of these problems that you know kind of inspire this type of motivation are sort inspire this type of motivation are sort inspire this type of motivation are sort of inherently riskier and I know you of inherently riskier and I know you of inherently riskier and I know you know this is something that we've talked know this is something that we've talked know this is something that we've talked about a lot about sort of the concept of about a lot about sort of the concept of about a lot about sort of the concept of taking risk in a career being a repeated taking risk in a career being a repeated taking risk in a career being a repeated game but how do you how do you think game but how do you how do you think game but how do you how do you think about the idea of taking risks in your about the idea of taking risks in your about the idea of taking risks in your career and how should people think about career and how should people think about career and how should people think about it maybe differently than they currently it maybe differently than they currently it maybe differently than they currently do well yeah I think people have do well yeah I think people have do well yeah I think people have terrible risk calculus in general even terrible risk calculus in general even terrible risk calculus in general even people who try to be really good about people who try to be really good about people who try to be really good about this are bad at it um the answer I think this are bad at it um the answer I think this are bad at it um the answer I think is almost always a you're wrong about is almost always a you're wrong about is almost always a you're wrong about what is risking what it's not risky and what is risking what it's not risky and what is risking what it's not risky and B most people don't take enough risk B most people don't take enough risk B most people don't take enough risk especially early in your career being on especially early in your career being on especially early in your career being on young and unknown and poor that is young and unknown and poor that is young and unknown and poor that is actually a great gift in terms of the actually a great gift in terms of the actually a great gift in terms of the amount of risk you can take amount of risk you can take amount of risk you can take and I think people don't capitalize on and I think people don't capitalize on and I think people don't capitalize on that enough I think what risk actually that enough I think what risk actually that enough I think what risk actually looks like is not doing something that looks like is not doing something that looks like is not doing something that you will then spend the rest of your you will then spend the rest of your you will then spend the rest of your life regretting and there's a quote you life regretting and there's a quote you life regretting and there's a quote you know people regret way more the things know people regret way more the things know people regret way more the things they didn't do them things that they did they didn't do them things that they did they didn't do them things that they did do so if you really believe in something do so if you really believe in something do so if you really believe in something there's an idea that you're super there's an idea that you're super there's an idea that you're super passionate about um you know and you passionate about um you know and you passionate about um you know and you take a calculated risk to start a take a calculated risk to start a take a calculated risk to start a company realizing you may forego a company realizing you may forego a company realizing you may forego a couple of years of studying come in couple of years of studying come in couple of years of studying come in another job and whatever else and you another job and whatever else and you another job and whatever else and you know maybe people call you a failure or know maybe people call you a failure or know maybe people call you a failure or whatever that's a great risk to take and whatever that's a great risk to take and whatever that's a great risk to take and if you don't take that risk I think you if you don't take that risk I think you if you don't take that risk I think you have a very high chance that you end up have a very high chance that you end up have a very high chance that you end up regretting that um I think the wrong regretting that um I think the wrong regretting that um I think the wrong kind of risk to take is where people kind of risk to take is where people kind of risk to take is where people don't actually do things or don't commit don't actually do things or don't commit don't actually do things or don't commit to something because they don't want to to something because they don't want to to something because they don't want to fail and they over rate the risk of fail and they over rate the risk of fail and they over rate the risk of failure and the reputation damage or failure and the reputation damage or failure and the reputation damage or embarrassment or whatever I think one embarrassment or whatever I think one embarrassment or whatever I think one really important thing to strive for in really important thing to strive for in really important thing to strive for in your career is to be a doer not a talker your career is to be a doer not a talker your career is to be a doer not a talker and the reason that people don't do and the reason that people don't do and the reason that people don't do stuff one is it's hard and two is it's stuff one is it's hard and two is it's stuff one is it's hard and two is it's risky and so you have these people that risky and so you have these people that risky and so you have these people that you know want to dabble on a bunch of you know want to dabble on a bunch of you know want to dabble on a bunch of different projects but never be all in different projects but never be all in different projects but never be all in on one and I think it's this combination on one and I think it's this combination on one and I think it's this combination of work and risk and it's you know I of work and risk and it's you know I of work and risk and it's you know I think that's really bad I think history think that's really bad I think history think that's really bad I think history belongs to the doers and I think you belongs to the doers and I think you belongs to the doers and I think you should take a risk actually do something should take a risk actually do something should take a risk actually do something don't just sit around and talk and don't just sit around and talk and don't just sit around and talk and organize and bring together groups and organize and bring together groups and organize and bring together groups and go to thought leadership conferences and go to thought leadership conferences and go to thought leadership conferences and whatever it is these people spend their whatever it is these people spend their whatever it is these people spend their time on other than actually building time on other than actually building time on other than actually building something and just take the risk of something and just take the risk of something and just take the risk of committing to what you you have committing to what you you have committing to what you you have conviction on yeah and I think people conviction on yeah and I think people conviction on yeah and I think people also seem to have sort of the fear of also seem to have sort of the fear of also seem to have sort of the fear of being told no a lot and not asking for being told no a lot and not asking for being told no a lot and not asking for what they want I'm sure that's something what they want I'm sure that's something what they want I'm sure that's something that you've encountered with people yeah that you've encountered with people yeah that you've encountered with people yeah um this was one of the other things I um this was one of the other things I um this was one of the other things I learned that I wish I had gotten advice learned that I wish I had gotten advice learned that I wish I had gotten advice on early in my career is ask for what on early in my career is ask for what on early in my career is ask for what you want you will get told no a lot but you want you will get told no a lot but you want you will get told no a lot but sometimes it will work and and I think sometimes it will work and and I think sometimes it will work and and I think you see a lot of entrepreneurs shoot you see a lot of entrepreneurs shoot you see a lot of entrepreneurs shoot themselves in the foot because they themselves in the foot because they themselves in the foot because they don't ask don't ask don't ask that person to quit the job and come that person to quit the job and come that person to quit the job and come join them they don't ask this big join them they don't ask this big join them they don't ask this big company to do a deal with them and company to do a deal with them and company to do a deal with them and they're just not aggressive enough and I they're just not aggressive enough and I they're just not aggressive enough and I think you being willing to ask what you think you being willing to ask what you think you being willing to ask what you want and be somewhat aggressive are want and be somewhat aggressive are want and be somewhat aggressive are really important characteristics of really important characteristics of really important characteristics of being an entrepreneur people don't want being an entrepreneur people don't want being an entrepreneur people don't want to fail they don't want to be told no to fail they don't want to be told no to fail they don't want to be told no they don't want to end up in some crisis they don't want to end up in some crisis they don't want to end up in some crisis another thing that I learned and I want another thing that I learned and I want another thing that I learned and I want to say I wish someone told me this one to say I wish someone told me this one to say I wish someone told me this one because I don't think it's a lesson because I don't think it's a lesson because I don't think it's a lesson anyone can teach you you have to just anyone can teach you you have to just anyone can teach you you have to just live through it is that each crisis gets live through it is that each crisis gets live through it is that each crisis gets less scary than the one before it less scary than the one before it less scary than the one before it you're running a company now I'm sure you're running a company now I'm sure you're running a company now I'm sure you've I hope you've noticed this by now you've I hope you've noticed this by now you've I hope you've noticed this by now you there are a lot of things that you there are a lot of things that you there are a lot of things that really go wrong and they feel like really go wrong and they feel like really go wrong and they feel like company killing events and they feel company killing events and they feel company killing events and they feel like there's no way you're going to like there's no way you're going to like there's no way you're going to survive because the crises are really survive because the crises are really survive because the crises are really bad and the thing you learn is that you bad and the thing you learn is that you bad and the thing you learn is that you generally do survive these and and that generally do survive these and and that generally do survive these and and that the world doesn't usually end and even the world doesn't usually end and even the world doesn't usually end and even if in the moment something happens you if in the moment something happens you if in the moment something happens you have no idea how you're going to get have no idea how you're going to get have no idea how you're going to get around it you eventually figure out a around it you eventually figure out a around it you eventually figure out a way and because of that you know on the way and because of that you know on the way and because of that you know on the 19th major crisis you're like well I 19th major crisis you're like well I 19th major crisis you're like well I survived the first 18 I'll probably get survived the first 18 I'll probably get survived the first 18 I'll probably get through this one bit and you kind of through this one bit and you kind of through this one bit and you kind of just do yeah definitely that rings true just do yeah definitely that rings true just do yeah definitely that rings true so switching into a bit topic of sort of so switching into a bit topic of sort of so switching into a bit topic of sort of money and sort of the long-term view of money and sort of the long-term view of

of Applebee's um so I I think that one of Applebee's um so I I think that one of the few arbitrage opportunities left in the few arbitrage opportunities left in the few arbitrage opportunities left in the market is time I think we have the market is time I think we have the market is time I think we have gotten really good at high frequency gotten really good at high frequency gotten really good at high frequency trading we've gotten really good at the trading we've gotten really good at the trading we've gotten really good at the price of things we've gotten worse at price of things we've gotten worse at price of things we've gotten worse at the long term value and I I don't think the long term value and I I don't think the long term value and I I don't think you can go beat the market in a lot of you can go beat the market in a lot of you can go beat the market in a lot of ways but the one way I do is is by ways but the one way I do is is by ways but the one way I do is is by making a long-term commitment to making a long-term commitment to making a long-term commitment to something I think that I my new belief something I think that I my new belief something I think that I my new belief on how long I should hold stock and the on how long I should hold stock and the on how long I should hold stock and the best companies I invest in is forever best companies I invest in is forever best companies I invest in is forever and I think you know in a world where and I think you know in a world where and I think you know in a world where people are increasingly focused on the people are increasingly focused on the people are increasingly focused on the tick and the quarterly earnings cycle tick and the quarterly earnings cycle tick and the quarterly earnings cycle you should try and go in the other you should try and go in the other you should try and go in the other direction and this is a great way to direction and this is a great way to direction and this is a great way to generate value and wealth and and so I generate value and wealth and and so I generate value and wealth and and so I think that when you're thinking about a think that when you're thinking about a think that when you're thinking about a startup it's really worthwhile to think startup it's really worthwhile to think startup it's really worthwhile to think about something you're willing to make a about something you're willing to make a about something you're willing to make a very long-term commitment to because very long-term commitment to because very long-term commitment to because that is where the current void in the that is where the current void in the that is where the current void in the market is um I think you know you get market is um I think you know you get market is um I think you know you get paid as a founder for the wealth you paid as a founder for the wealth you paid as a founder for the wealth you crave for other people so there's this crave for other people so there's this crave for other people so there's this view of the world that business is all view of the world that business is all view of the world that business is all about like trying to steal money and about like trying to steal money and about like trying to steal money and sometimes that's true but but they're sometimes that's true but but they're sometimes that's true but but they're the best companies just create massive the best companies just create massive the best companies just create massive amounts of value for the world and then amounts of value for the world and then amounts of value for the world and then they capture some of that for themselves they capture some of that for themselves they capture some of that for themselves but they capture far less than they but they capture far less than they but they capture far less than they create and they do it over a very long create and they do it over a very long create and they do it over a very long period of time so if you're going to be period of time so if you're going to be period of time so if you're going to be one of those companies one of those companies one of those companies um I think you want to make a super long um I think you want to make a super long um I think you want to make a super long term commitment to yourself and others term commitment to yourself and others term commitment to yourself and others that are going to work on it with you that are going to work on it with you that are going to work on it with you that this is going to take a long time that this is going to take a long time that this is going to take a long time um but it is worth waiting because you um but it is worth waiting because you um but it is worth waiting because you will make far more money over the long will make far more money over the long will make far more money over the long horizon by doing this company really horizon by doing this company really horizon by doing this company really well then a bunch of short-term things well then a bunch of short-term things well then a bunch of short-term things along the way so how much do you think along the way so how much do you think along the way so how much do you think people should have strong opinions about people should have strong opinions about people should have strong opinions about things versus putting something into the things versus putting something into the things versus putting something into the world iterating and sort of finding out world iterating and sort of finding out world iterating and sort of finding out whatever works and going with that I whatever works and going with that I whatever works and going with that I think you want a combination of those think you want a combination of those think you want a combination of those two things you won't want to have a two things you won't want to have a two things you won't want to have a strong opinion and then be flexible strong opinion and then be flexible strong opinion and then be flexible about the details so the thing I don't about the details so the thing I don't about the details so the thing I don't think works that often are the startups think works that often are the startups think works that often are the startups on their love of the pivot that are on their love of the pivot that are on their love of the pivot that are totally unrelated but I put a big totally unrelated but I put a big totally unrelated but I put a big difference between refinement and difference between refinement and difference between refinement and pivoting so when you start with a strong pivoting so when you start with a strong pivoting so when you start with a strong belief you know we should have a social belief you know we should have a social belief you know we should have a social graph in an online directory that is graph in an online directory that is graph in an online directory that is Facebook has stayed pretty similar to Facebook has stayed pretty similar to Facebook has stayed pretty similar to that although the product itself has that although the product itself has that although the product itself has changed a lot along the way and I think changed a lot along the way and I think changed a lot along the way and I think that's really good that is a strong idea that's really good that is a strong idea that's really good that is a strong idea with flexibility in the implementation with flexibility in the implementation with flexibility in the implementation and I think that's much better than the and I think that's much better than the and I think that's much better than the we're just going to keep trying random we're just going to keep trying random we're just going to keep trying random ideas because we want to have a startup ideas because we want to have a startup ideas because we want to have a startup I think strong with strong opinions I think strong with strong opinions I think strong with strong opinions about the future are really important about the future are really important about the future are really important and I think one of the things that I and I think one of the things that I and I think one of the things that I have noticed among the most interesting have noticed among the most interesting have noticed among the most interesting the most successful people that I spend the most successful people that I spend the most successful people that I spend time with is that they have strong time with is that they have strong time with is that they have strong opinions strongly held about the future opinions strongly held about the future opinions strongly held about the future they are willing to be convinced with they are willing to be convinced with they are willing to be convinced with new data they are wrong but the bar for new data they are wrong but the bar for new data they are wrong but the bar for that is fairly high and this idea that that is fairly high and this idea that that is fairly high and this idea that the future is fundamentally unknowable the future is fundamentally unknowable the future is fundamentally unknowable I've never liked actually I remember I've never liked actually I remember I've never liked actually I remember pretty clearly this time war I was sort pretty clearly this time war I was sort pretty clearly this time war I was sort of like spouting advice someone else had of like spouting advice someone else had of like spouting advice someone else had given me in high school or college about given me in high school or college about given me in high school or college about how you in you know you need to how you in you know you need to how you in you know you need to diversify and investing because the diversify and investing because the diversify and investing because the world is unknown unknowable and so all world is unknown unknowable and so all world is unknown unknowable and so all you can do is have the most balanced you can do is have the most balanced you can do is have the most balanced possible portfolio and I remember that I possible portfolio and I remember that I possible portfolio and I remember that I was saying that out loud someone else's was saying that out loud someone else's was saying that out loud someone else's said it to me probably grandma and and I said it to me probably grandma and and I said it to me probably grandma and and I realized that I really didn't agree with realized that I really didn't agree with realized that I really didn't agree with at all um because I had strong opinions at all um because I had strong opinions at all um because I had strong opinions and then I knew that there were some and then I knew that there were some and then I knew that there were some companies who stock I'd rather own than companies who stock I'd rather own than companies who stock I'd rather own than others and I knew that I would rather others and I knew that I would rather others and I knew that I would rather like own stock than own bombs because I like own stock than own bombs because I like own stock than own bombs

your investment portfolio or your career or your life and then the or your career or your life and then the or your career or your life and then the final question is if you could leave final question is if you could leave final question is if you could leave young people who want to have a big young people who want to have a big young people who want to have a big impact with one or two pieces of advice impact with one or two pieces of advice impact with one or two pieces of advice what would you tell them well I don't what would you tell them well I don't what would you tell them well I don't want to give people a specific field to want to give people a specific field to want to give people a specific field to go work on because I think the whole go work on because I think the whole go work on because I think the whole idea is that people need to figure out idea is that people need to figure out idea is that people need to figure out themselves what they believe in and what themselves what they believe in and what themselves what they believe in and what they think and what they believe is they think and what they believe is they think and what they believe is high-impact to work on for the future so high-impact to work on for the future so high-impact to work on for the future so what I will say instead is it is really what I will say instead is it is really what I will say instead is it is really important to actually think hard about important to actually think hard about important to actually think hard about where you think you can make the biggest where you think you can make the biggest where you think you can make the biggest contribution that you're good at and the contribution that you're good at and the contribution that you're good at and the world needs and that you enjoy and then world needs and that you enjoy and then world needs and that you enjoy and then go meet people to work with go learn as go meet people to work with go learn as go meet people to work with go learn as much about that field as you can and much about that field as you can and much about that field as you can and then have the the courage of your then have the the courage of your then have the the courage of your convictions to actually take a risk and convictions to actually take a risk and convictions to actually take a risk and focus on it and go do something there focus on it and go do something there focus on it and go do something there and that it's okay if you fail and if and that it's okay if you fail and if and that it's
