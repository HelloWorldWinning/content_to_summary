好的，以下是根据您提供的文本生成的中文总结，包含大纲、核心观点、总体框架以及 Mermaid 概念图。

**总结**

**核心观点:**

多头注意力机制通过在不同子空间提取上下文信息，从而在计算成本与单头注意力相似的情况下，提升了模型对输入序列的理解能力。

**总体框架:**

本文介绍了多头注意力机制，首先回顾了缩放点积注意力（Scaled Dot-Product Attention, SDP），然后详细阐述了多头注意力的工作原理，最后区分了自注意力（Self-Attention）和交叉注意力（Cross-Attention）两种应用方式。

**大纲:**

1.  **缩放点积注意力回顾（Scaled Dot-Product Attention Recap）**
    *   目标：找到序列中词语之间的关系。
    *   步骤：
        *   提取特征 X1 到 Xt。
        *   计算查询（Q）、键（K）、值（V）向量。
        *   计算 Q 和 K 的点积，得到兼容性矩阵。
        *   缩放兼容性矩阵（除以 d_k 的平方根）。
        *   （可选）掩盖未来tokens。
        *   应用 Softmax 归一化。
        *   计算注意力权重与 V 的矩阵乘积，得到上下文矩阵 Z。

2.  **多头注意力机制（Multi-Head Attention）**
    *   核心思想：将大的 Q、K、V 矩阵分解成多个小的子空间，分别进行缩放点积注意力计算。
    *   步骤：
        *   定义头的数量 (H)。
        *   为每个头计算 Q、K、V 矩阵（Q1-QH, K1-KH, V1-VH）。
        *   对每个头的 Q、K、V 进行缩放点积注意力计算，得到上下文矩阵头（Head_i）。
        *   拼接所有头的输出矩阵（Head_1 to Head_H），得到矩阵 Z。
        *   矩阵 Z 与可学习的权重矩阵 W_o 相乘，得到最终的上下文输出。
    *   优势：能在不同子空间提取上下文信息，提升模型理解能力。
    *   计算成本：与单头注意力相似。

3.  **自注意力 vs. 交叉注意力（Self-Attention vs. Cross-Attention）**
    *   自注意力：关注输入序列内部词语之间的关系。
    *   交叉注意力：关注两个不同序列 X 和 Y 之间的关系。
        *   应用场景：例如机器翻译。
        *   实现：从序列 Y 提取 Q，从序列 X 提取 K 和 V。

4.  **练习（Exercise）**
    *   给定 X (T1 x D) 和 Y (T2 x D)，求单头交叉注意力中 Q、K、V、兼容性矩阵、最终上下文矩阵 Z 的维度。

attention mechanism series brought to attention mechanism series brought to you by the MLS studio in this video I you by the MLS studio in this video I you by the MLS studio in this video I will talk about multi-head attention will talk about multi-head attention will talk about multi-head attention that was proposed in the paper attention that was proposed in the paper attention that was proposed in the paper attention is all you need is all you need is all you need here is the outline of this video in the here is the outline of this video in the here is the outline of this video in the last video I described the scaled dot last video I described the scaled dot last video I described the scaled dot product attention in full detail but product attention in full detail but product attention in full detail but given that the scale. product or sdp is given that the scale. product or sdp is given that the scale. product or sdp is at the core of multi-head attention so at the core of multi-head attention so at the core of multi-head attention so in this video first we will see a quick in this video first we will see a quick in this video first we will see a quick recap of sdp then I will describe what recap of sdp then I will describe what recap of sdp then I will describe what multi-head attention is and how it works multi-head attention is and how it works multi-head attention is and how it works and finally we can see two ways of using and finally we can see two ways of using and finally we can see two ways of using the attention mechanism which is either the attention mechanism which is either the attention mechanism which is either using it as self-attention or using it using it as self-attention or using it using it as self-attention or using it for cross attention so we will see the for cross attention so we will see the for cross attention so we will see the differences between the two mechanisms differences between the two mechanisms differences between the two mechanisms and at the end I will finish this video and at the end I will finish this video and at the end I will finish this video with an exercise with an exercise with an exercise so first let's start with a quick so first let's start with a quick so first let's start with a quick overview of scale dot product attention overview of scale dot product attention overview of scale dot product attention or sdp or sdp or sdp given a sequence of words for example given a sequence of words for example given a sequence of words for example words from an English sentence the goal words from an English sentence the goal words from an English sentence the goal of sdp is to find the relationship of sdp is to find the relationship of sdp is to find the relationship between these words between these words between these words so here each rectangle represents a word so here each rectangle represents a word so here each rectangle represents a word or token in this sentence so first we or token in this sentence so first we or token in this sentence so first we extract features X1 to x t where T is extract features X1 to x t where T is extract features X1 to x t where T is the sequence length the sequence length the sequence length then from each x i we compute three then from each x i we compute three then from each x i we compute three vectors q k and V which are known as vectors q k and V which are known as vectors q k and V which are known as query key and value vectors these query key and value vectors these query key and value vectors these computations are based on a matrix computations are based on a matrix computations are based on a matrix multiplication as shown in the equation multiplication as shown in the equation multiplication as shown in the equation box here box here box here then we put these q k and V vectors then we put these q k and V vectors then we put these q k and V vectors together to form matrices q k and v as together to form matrices q k and v as together to form matrices q k and v as shown here at this point we are ready to shown here at this point we are ready to shown here at this point we are ready to move to the first step in the move to the first step in the move to the first step in the scale. product attention scale. product attention scale. product attention on the left panel you can see the full on the left panel you can see the full on the left panel you can see the full diagram of scale dot product attention diagram of scale dot product attention diagram of scale dot product attention with q k and V matrices as input in the with q k and V matrices as input in the with q k and V matrices as input in the first step we compute a DOT product or a first step we compute a DOT product or a first step we compute a DOT product or a matrix multiplication between q and K matrix multiplication between q and K matrix multiplication between q and K and we'll get a compatibility Matrix and we'll get a compatibility Matrix and we'll get a compatibility Matrix which has dimensionality t by T which has dimensionality t by T which has dimensionality t by T in the next step we scale the in the next step we scale the in the next step we scale the compatibility matrix by 1 over a square compatibility matrix by 1 over a square compatibility matrix by 1 over a square root of d sub K where d sub K is the root of d sub K where d sub K is the root of d sub K where d sub K is the dimensionality of vectors q and K in the dimensionality of vectors q and K in the dimensionality of vectors q and K in the previous video I explained why this previous video I explained why this previous video I explained why this scaling is necessary but for the sake of scaling is necessary but for the sake of scaling is necessary but for the sake of time we can skip this discussion here time we can skip this discussion here time we can skip this discussion here step 3 is an optional step so I did not step 3 is an optional step so I did not step 3 is an optional step so I did not cover that in the previous video cover that in the previous video cover that in the previous video this step is only needed in some this step is only needed in some this step is only needed in some applications such as in sequence to applications such as in sequence to applications such as in sequence to sequence translation or Auto regressive sequence translation or Auto regressive sequence translation or Auto regressive sequence generation sequence generation sequence generation for example when we are training a model for example when we are training a model for example when we are training a model to generate new sequences and our input to generate new sequences and our input to generate new sequences and our input sequences contain past and future sequences contain past and future sequences contain past and future sections of a sentence the objective is sections of a sentence the objective is sections of a sentence the objective is to predict future tokens of that input to predict future tokens of that input to predict future tokens of that input sequence but the input sequence contains sequence but the input sequence contains sequence but the input sequence contains future tokens so in that case we have to future tokens so in that case we have to future tokens so in that case we have to mask the future tokens mask the future tokens mask the future tokens and we can do that by setting the upper and we can do that by setting the upper and we can do that by setting the upper triangular section of the compatibility triangular section of the compatibility triangular section of the compatibility Matrix to negative Infinity as shown Matrix to negative Infinity as shown Matrix to negative Infinity as shown here this will ensure that word I will here this will ensure that word I will here this will ensure that word I will not be able to see or attend towards not be able to see or attend towards not be able to see or attend towards with larger index than itself with larger index than itself with larger index than itself now in Step 4 we apply the softmax now in Step 4 we apply the softmax now in Step 4 we apply the softmax function to normalize the compatibility function to normalize the compatibility function to normalize the compatibility Matrix which results in the attention Matrix which results in the attention Matrix which results in the attention weights weights weights note that if we have masked the upper note that if we have masked the upper note that if we have masked the upper triangle of the compatibility Matrix in triangle of the compatibility Matrix in triangle of the compatibility Matrix in step 3 with negative Infinity then after step 3 with negative Infinity then after step 3 with negative Infinity then after applying the soft Max the upper triangle applying the soft Max the upper triangle applying the soft Max the upper triangle of the result will be zero and finally of the result will be zero and finally of the result will be zero and finally in a step 5 we perform another matrix in a step 5 we perform another matrix in a step 5 we perform another matrix multiplication between the attention multiplication between the attention multiplication between the attention weights from previous step and the weights from previous step and the weights from previous step and the Matrix V the result of this is our Matrix V the result of this is our Matrix V the result of this is our context Matrix which we call Matrix Z so context Matrix

finally in the last step we perform a matrix multiplication between Matrix Z matrix multiplication between Matrix Z matrix multiplication between Matrix Z and the learnable weight Matrix w o and the learnable weight Matrix w o and the learnable weight Matrix w o resulting in the context output for this resulting in the context output for this resulting in the context output for this multi-head attention layer a very multi-head attention layer a very multi-head attention layer a very important Point here is that the important Point here is that the important Point here is that the computational cost of multi-head computational cost of multi-head computational cost of multi-head attention is more or less similar to attention is more or less similar to attention is more or less similar to performing a single scale dot product on performing a single scale dot product on performing a single scale dot product on large q k and V matrices but while the large q k and V matrices but while the large q k and V matrices but while the computational cost is similar multi-ed computational cost is similar multi-ed computational cost is similar multi-ed attention is more beneficial than a attention is more beneficial than a attention is more beneficial than a single scale dot product attention the single scale dot product attention the single scale dot product attention the reason is multi-ed attention can extract reason is multi-ed attention can extract reason is multi-ed attention can extract context information from different context information from different context information from different subspaces at different positions of the subspaces at different positions of the subspaces at different positions of the input sequence input sequence input sequence so that brings us to the last topic of so that brings us to the last topic of so that brings us to the last topic of this video self-attention versus cross this video self-attention versus cross this video self-attention versus cross attention so self-attention is when we attention so self-attention is when we attention so self-attention is when we want to get the relationship among the want to get the relationship among the want to get the relationship among the words in an input sequence and we have words in an input sequence and we have words in an input sequence and we have seen several examples so far in this seen several examples so far in this seen several examples so far in this video and the previous one each word in video and the previous one each word in video and the previous one each word in this sequence can attend to other words this sequence can attend to other words this sequence can attend to other words with different degrees with different degrees with different degrees but for cross-attention we have two but for cross-attention we have two but for cross-attention we have two sequences X and Y and this could be for sequences X and Y and this could be for sequences X and Y and this could be for example a translation application like X example a translation application like X example a translation application like X is the sentences in English and Y is is the sentences in English and Y is is the sentences in English and Y is their translations in German and the their translations in German and the their translations in German and the length of sequence is X and Y could be length of sequence is X and Y could be length of sequence is X and Y could be different here we can use cross different here we can use cross different here we can use cross attention to make each word in sequence attention to make each word in sequence attention to make each word in sequence y to attend towards in sequence X so y to attend towards in sequence X so y to attend towards in sequence X so let's see how this can be done let's see how this can be done let's see how this can be done so as we have seen so far for so as we have seen so far for so as we have seen so far for self-attention with scale. product we self-attention with scale. product we self-attention with scale. product we extract matrices q k and V from the extract matrices q k and V from the extract matrices q k and V from the input sequence X but for cross attention input sequence X but for cross attention input sequence X but for cross attention we have two input sequences X and Y and we have two input sequences X and Y and we have two input sequences X and Y and in order to make sequence y attend to in order to make sequence y attend to in order to make sequence y attend to the words in sequence X we extract the words in sequence X we extract the words in sequence X we extract Matrix Q from y abstract Matrix K and V Matrix Q from y abstract Matrix K and V Matrix Q from y abstract Matrix K and V from X therefore the main difference from X therefore the main difference from X therefore the main difference between the self-attention and cross between the self-attention and cross between the self-attention and cross attention is basically where q k and V attention is basically where q k and V attention is basically where q k and V come from after we obtain these q k and come from after we obtain these q k and come from after we obtain these q k and V the rest are the same V the rest are the same V the rest are the same I want to finish this video with an I want to finish
