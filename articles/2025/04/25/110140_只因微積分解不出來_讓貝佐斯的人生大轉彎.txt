好的，以下是根据您提供的文本生成的摘要：

**摘要：**

1.  **背景:**

    *   讲述者回忆起大学期间（可能为大三）解一道偏微分方程的经历。
    *   他和室友Joe（数学很好）花了3个小时也无法解决。

2.  **事件:**

    *   两人决定向普林斯顿大学最聪明的人Yos请教。
    *   Yos看了一会儿题目，直接说答案是“余弦”（Cosine）。
    *   Yos随后用三页纸的代数运算证明了答案确实是余弦。

3.  **结论:**

    *   讲述者意识到自己永远无法成为伟大的理论物理学家。

**核心观点：**

意识到自身在特定领域的局限性，是成长过程中重要的顿悟时刻。

**总体框架:**

个人经历 → 难题挑战 → 大牛解题 → 自我认知
