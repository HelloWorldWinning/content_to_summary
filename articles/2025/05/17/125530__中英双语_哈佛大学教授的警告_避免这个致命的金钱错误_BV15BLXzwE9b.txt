**摘要**

**I. 核心观点：**

持久的幸福感并非来自物质的积累，而是来自拥有与需求之间的平衡，以及对信仰、家庭、友谊和有意义的工作的追求。

**II. 主要内容提纲：**

*   **A. 金钱与幸福的误解：**
    *   人们常常误以为金钱越多越幸福，从而陷入追逐物质的“享乐跑步机”。
    *   真正的幸福感并非来自拥有多少，而是来自拥有的东西与需求的比例。
    *   “愿望清单”可能适得其反，因为它强化了欲望，降低了满足感。
*   **B. 创业精神与真正的满足：**
    *   金钱本身并不重要，重要的是金钱所代表的价值和成就。
    *   成功的企业家并非仅仅追求金钱，而是追求他们所创造的繁荣和价值。
    *   通过技能、激情和为他人服务，才能获得真正的满足感。
*   **C. 人生追求的真正目标：**
    *   不要追求金钱、权力、享乐和名誉，这些都是无法带来真正满足的“偶像”。
    *   真正带来持久幸福的是信仰、家庭、友谊和有意义的工作。
    *   通过工作实现个人价值，并通过服务他人来贡献社会。
*   **D. 贫困问题的反思：**
    *   政府在扶贫方面投入巨大，但效果并不理想。
    *   虽然扶贫项目减轻了贫困带来的痛苦，但未能真正帮助人们摆脱贫困。
    *   重要的是要让人们感到被需要，从而获得尊严和价值感。
*   **E. 尊严与贫困：**
    *   尊严的对立面是绝望。
    *   不应将穷人视为需要管理的负担，而应视为需要开发的资产。
    *   公共政策应鼓励人们积极参与社会，而不是让他们依赖救济。
    *   通过工作、家庭和社会关系，让人们感到被需要，从而获得尊严。

**III. 总体框架：**

这段内容探讨了幸福的本质、金钱与幸福的关系、创业精神的价值、人生追求的目标以及贫困问题的反思。它强调，真正的幸福感并非来自物质的积累，而是来自精神的满足和对社会的贡献。

 The big mistake that people make in their lives is that they go from the bottom through kind of these low economic levels, noticing that they're feeling better. And then they say, oh, therefore more money, I'm going to feel better. And they chase the cookie for the rest of their life. It's like Pavlov's dogs. You've got programmed early on to thinking that your affect balance is going to get better. I'm going to feel better. They're working too hard to try to make them more money or what's, what, why is it a problem? It's a problem because they're never, they're on the hedonic treadmill. They've always, they're always going to get the satisfaction. They want more, but they never get what they want, but they're always fooled. This is why it's very important for all of us to remember satisfaction doesn't come from what you have. Satisfaction comes from what you have divided by what you want. And each of us, if we actually want to find enduring satisfaction, no matter where we are economically, we need a wants management strategy. So each, the worst, most metastatically stupid idea in Western society, in American societies, the bucket list. The bucket list is like, I'm going to make a list of all my cravings and attachments and desires and I'm going to pour over it. And all that does is lowers my, these are really satisfaction. But isn't it, isn't it good for people to be striving to work harder and build things though, as an economy? This is your point. This gets to your point. So you said, okay. So does that mean that, you know, money doesn't matter? No, money per se doesn't matter, but what you're actually being compensated for matters. So Joseph Schumpader, the father of modern entrepreneurship, the understanding of the professor at Harvard, but he was a visionary. He said that entrepreneurs actually don't care about money per se, more than the fact that it's a scorecard for what they're building. This is the key thing. And so for entrepreneurs who are being really successful, don't think that your satisfaction is actually coming from the money. It's not. Your satisfaction is actually coming from the prosperity that you're creating. You're doing something beautiful. You're earning your success. Your skills are meeting your passions. You're serving other human beings. You still serve everyone by building and creating. We shouldn't be doing it to want to get our private job. Look, the same Thomas Aquinas in 1265 writes the Sumithologia. And he says basically that there are four idols that people chase in life. Money, power, pleasure, and honor by which he meant fame, which we mean prestige in life. Those are idols that never bring satisfaction. They run you in the wrong direction. If you want to be ambitious, be ambitious for truly the four things that will enduringly bring authentic happiness. Faith, family, friendship, and work that does only two things. Where you earn your success and you serve other people. And by faith, I mean life philosophy that transcends something bigger than you. Faith, family, friendship, and work. Be ambitious for those four things and the world's your oyster. Faith, family, friendship, and work. I want to ask a little bit about poverty because of something you spend a lot of time. I think one of the most inspiring things I was ever at is a couple of times when we were at Sea Island and you were seeing there speaking to everybody. And it was great because you had over 100 billionaires in the room. And you were inspiring everyone about how to help the Leeswall off in our society. And I think you really did a great job, I think, for a lot of the right and transforming the focus to be our values are only really good if we're helping the Leeswall off. It's clear you really care about that. The US government since the War on Poverty has spent trillions of dollars. It hasn't really worked. We're about to spend trillions more right now. Nothing about this print $4 trillion more dollars as a current debate and discussion to supposedly help the poverty. It doesn't seem to be working. We're still doing it. What's going on? What should we be doing? And is it going to work this time at all? Like they're spending all this money. What are they doing? Well, what we've done since 1964, 1964 when the War on Poverty was declared by Lyndon B. Johnson. But it's really 1966 when the programs were up and running is that the poverty rate is bounced around between 10% and 15% every year since then. The fact that we spent somewhere around $20 trillion dollars in the War on Poverty. That's failure in any industry except government, quite frankly. You wouldn't get the investment year after year after year. However, let's not underestimate actually how much it has allowed the War on Poverty and the programs that have allowed people to suffer less, suffer less the depredations of poverty, the public health crises, the deaths that didn't have to occur, which is really good. But it's helped for sure. Absolutely. And people on the political right really need to recognize that. The problem is not that poverty has become more bearable. It has become more bearable. The problem is that poverty is not more escapable. So when we say 10% to 15%, I mean, this is extremely relative. I'll give you an example. Today, the 10th percentile economically in America lives in the same square footage of housing as the person at the 50th percentile in 1980. Wow. So think about that. It was in 1980. I was a sophomore in high school. I realized you weren't born yet, but you know, a couple of years. I was so depressing. Anyway, so you know, what was the and we were a lower middle class family. We're the 25th percentile economically as I was growing up on the north side of Queen Anne Hill in Seattle. Very, you know, it was in those days and working class neighborhood. These days, who knows, is probably like, you know, the bedroom for Amazon or something. Probably. A hovel is, you know, a billion dollars or something. So the point is that, you know, this is really, really relative between 10 and 15% of the population. Everybody is running water. You know, most everybody's got a TV or whatever that it has. Yes, people are people there living lives of luxury versus 100 years ago. Yeah, exactly right. But they're still not happy. It's not they're not happy because poverty is not escapable. Yeah. See, this is not how people are wired. The problem is with, you know, the welfare mentality of the elite classes and government officials is not that we can't relieve people of the worst, you know, the depredations of poverty that leave people in the worst condition. The problem is that we misunderstand the human condition of what actually brings happiness. What brings happiness is being able to succeed on my merits to actually understand my own passions. What brings happiness is to see that my life is an enterprise. I mean, you're an entrepreneur. So you understand perfectly, there's this unique adventure that comes from being an entrepreneur. Every single person watching us and listening to us today is an entrepreneur because the startup is your life. And when we actually take away the initiative of people to see their life as a startup, we truly have created poverty. That is poverty. So we need, we need people to feel wanted. Totally. We need people to feel needed. See, to be needed is the essence of dignity. Dignity is to be worthy of respect. And we believe in the West that everybody has radically equal human dignity. And part of that is coming from the Judeo-Christian understanding that we're made in God's image. So even if you're an atheist, you're stewing in this concept of being made in God's image. And God is worthy of respect. And so every human is worthy of respect. To be worthy of respect means you have dignity and nobody has less dignity than somebody else. And the world believes that. But we fundamentally believe that in the West. That changed the world, by the way. And it's something that's a really, really important thing for us to keep in mind. Notwithstanding your religious views at all. Okay. So what is the opposite of dignity? And the answer is despair. I was having this. It was listening to this speech by the Roman Catholic cardinal of Chicago, Colonel Francis George. He passed away a couple of years ago. And he was talking to his richest donors. And he was on the North Shore of Chicago. And he was talking about funding his poverty programs on the south side of the city. You know, places that they like literally never bit. Yeah. And he said, here's why they needed to fund these poverty programs. He said, the poor need you to pull them out of poverty. And like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And you need the poor to keep you out of hell. Right. Is what he said. And I thought about that. And I understand the theological significance of that statement. But then I thought, do we as a society need the poor? The problem that we have is we treat the poor as liabilities to manage as opposed to assets to develop. Now, you run companies successfully and know you got both liabilities and assets. Liabilities you manage until you can get them off the books. Assets can be unbelievably unprofitable and expensive, but you develop them because that's the future of your people. Your people are your assets. And you're in the gold. It's up everybody. Exactly right. You would never, I mean, your kids, you could treat them like liabilities or assets. You could treat them like assets because you want them to have dignity. If you want people to feel dignity, people, especially who are in poverty, they need to be needed. So every public policy should ask the following question. Is this making people more necessary or less necessary? If it's devaluing their work or creating disincentives for them to work, if it's fragmenting their community, if it's giving them less of a desire or incentive to live with and care for their families, you've said to them that they are not needed and that's the ultimate sin of public policy. That's what keeps us where we are.
