Description:
好的，以下是根据提供的文本提取的核心观点、总结和概念图。

**总结核心观点**

文本围绕“如何获得你想要的一切”展开，核心理念和行动指南是一个字：“问”。

**总结概要 (大纲结构)**

1.  **核心原则：提问是获得的基础。**
    *   这是生活中需要精通的一门关键艺术。
    *   成功不仅在于努力工作，更在于善于提问。

2.  **提问与接收的三个关键点：**
    *   **提问是接收的开端：** 提问启动了获得所需的过程，一个无需完全理解其机制但确实有效的心智和情感过程。
    *   **接收不是问题：** 接收是自动发生的。主要障碍在于未能提问或提问不当（例如，努力工作但没有明确的目标）。
    *   **接收如海洋般充裕：** 成功和机会并非稀缺。问题在于人们往往只准备了“茶匙”来获取，而非能容纳更多的“水桶”。应当扩大获取的“容器”（即提高目标和期望）。

3.  **两种提问的方式：**
    *   **带着智慧去问：** 提问必须清晰、具体、明确。详细定义和描述你想要什么（例如，大小、颜色、时间、数量），这能让目标产生吸引力。
    *   **带着信心去问：** 像孩子一样毫无保留地相信你能得到它，而不是像怀疑的成年人那样。

4.  **成功的终极公式：**
    *   像成年人一样周密地制定计划。
    *   像孩子一样坚定地相信这些计划能够实现。
    *   结合两者，不可思议的事情将会发生。

5.  **实践建议：** 尝试这种方法（成人规划+孩子信心）90天。

**核心结论（一句话）**

获得你想要的一切的核心在于将成年人的智慧规划与孩子的坚定信念结合起来进行提问和追求。

**总体框架**

文本提供了一个基于“提问”的个人目标实现框架。这个框架从核心行动“提问”出发，阐述其重要性、内在机制以及成功接收的条件，进而细化了“如何有效提问”（智慧与信心），并最终给出了一个整合行动与信念的实践公式，指引听众去尝试和实践。

 How to get whatever you want. That's the title of the next set of notes. How to get whatever you want. Here's what it says if you're ready. It says, ask. That's it. End of notes. Ask. If there's one art in life to learn extremely well, that's got to be one of them. The art of asking. What does ask mean? Ask means. What do you want? And the formula's staggering. It says ask and what? A guy ought to look into that. LAUGHTER See, you've got to be better than a good worker. You've got to be a good asker. Now let me give you three key points on asking and receiving. This can do it. Number one. Asking is the beginning of receiving. Asking starts a unique process. Mental and emotional. I don't even know how it works. All I know is it works. It's like pushing a button and all this machinery starts working. I don't know how. It just works. There's a lot of things. You don't need to know how. Just work them. Some people are always studying the roots. Others are picking the fruit. I mean, it depends on what end of it you want in on. Asking is the beginning of receiving. So start the process. Here's number two. Receiving is not the problem. Receiving is automatic. Now if that's true, receiving is not the problem. What's the problem? Failure to ask might be one of your major problems. I don't know. Check it out. The guy says, oh, now I see it. I got up last year and hit it every day. But there's not a scrap of paper with my goals. Good work. Poor ask. So you've got to change that. Here's number three. Receiving is like the ocean. There's plenty. Success is not in short supply. It isn't rationed. And you stepped up to the window and it was all gone. No, no, no. It's like an ocean here. Now if that's true, what's the problem? Well, some people go to the ocean with a teaspoon. Have you got the picture? See what you want to do in view of the size of the ocean is trade your teaspoon for at least a bucket. And you'll look better down at the ocean. Kids won't make fun of you, right? Okay. Now there's two ways to ask and we'll wrap up goal setting. Two ways. Here's number one. Ask with intelligence. It didn't say ask intelligently, but I'm sure it meant that. Don't mumble. You don't get anything but mumbling. Be clear. Be specific. Intelligent asking means how wide, how high, how soon. When, what size, what color, how much? Define what you want and describe what you want. That's powerful. Goals become like a magnet. They pull you that direction. And the better you describe them, the more they pull. So ask intelligently. Here's number two. Ask with faith. That's the childish part of the equation. Believe you can get what you want like a child. Not an adult. Adults are too skeptical. So the formula really reads, make plans like an adult, and believe in them like a child. And the most incredible things will happen. Just try it for 90 days. Just try it. You can always go back to the old ways. Just try it just 90 days, 90 days. The world admires the doers.
