And model that we're going to be using. And model that we're going to be using. And if you look here at the main page, if you look here at the main page, if you look here at the main page, you'll see the usual stream generate you'll see the usual stream generate you'll see the usual stream generate media. And here, if you go into starter media. And here, if you go into starter media. And here, if you go into starter apps, you'll find something they've apps, you'll find something they've apps, you'll find something they've launched that's really quite launched that's really quite launched that's really quite interesting, which is the video interesting, which is the video interesting, which is the video tolearning app. So if we click on that tolearning app. So if we click on that tolearning app. So if we click on that again, it will take you to that page and again, it will take you to that page and again, it will take you to that page and you'll see this interface where you can you'll see this interface where you can you'll see this interface where you can actually post a YouTube video. What it actually post a YouTube video. What it actually post a YouTube video. What it will do is it will generate an app that will do is it will generate an app that will do is it will generate an app that you can use to learn the key concepts you can use to learn the key concepts you can use to learn the key concepts from the video and to have it in a more from the video and to have it in a more from the video and to have it in a more interactive way. So I've just found here interactive way. So I've just found here interactive way. So I've just found here a video that I think is quite a video that I think is quite a video that I think is quite interesting. So I'm going to add that interesting. So I'm going to add that interesting. So I'm going to add that video link and then I'm going to use it video link and then I'm going to use it video link and then I'm going to use it to generate the app. So this video is to generate the app. So this video is to generate the app. So this video is basically about what happens when you basically about what happens when you basically about what happens when you quit sugar in 30 days. So let's see what quit sugar in 30 days. So let's see what quit sugar in 30 days. So let's see what kind of app it's going to generate for kind of app it's going to generate for kind of app it's going to generate for us. Okay. So it's now come back with the us. Okay. So it's now come back with the us. Okay. So it's now come back with the app that it's created and you can see app that it's created and you can see app that it's created and you can see here that it's decided to go with this here that it's decided to go with this here that it's decided to go with this 30 days sugar-free journey kind of 30 days sugar-free journey kind of 30 days sugar-free journey kind of calendar. And then we've got day zero calendar. And then we've got day zero calendar. And then we've got day zero here. It says, "Welcome. This is day here. It says, "Welcome. This is day here.

You can see there's of the video. You can see there's of the video. You can see there's interactive animations. And then we've interactive animations. And then we've interactive animations. And then we've got here as well ocean acidification got here as well ocean acidification got here as well ocean acidification analogy and it's got a nice interactive analogy and it's got a nice interactive analogy and it's got a nice interactive picture down here as well. And then picture down here as well. And then picture down here as well. And then we've got impossibility of perfect we've got impossibility of perfect we've got impossibility of perfect specification. And then it's got again specification. And then it's got again specification. And then it's got again some visuals here and so on for the some visuals here and so on for the some visuals here and so on for the entire deck. Another very interesting entire deck. Another very interesting entire deck. Another very interesting way to take your video and just create a way to take your video and just create a way to take your video and just create a really interesting interactive way to really interesting interactive way to really interesting interactive way to visualize the concepts and to enhance visualize the concepts and to enhance visualize the concepts and to enhance the learning to write something that's the learning to write something that's the learning to write something that's really engaging that you can go through really engaging that you can go through really engaging that you can go through in your presentations.
