Description:
好的，这是对文本的总结、核心观点、框架和美人鱼图。

**总结**

本文的核心在于如何获得你想要的一切，其关键原则只有一个字：“提问”。提问是一种至关重要的艺术，比仅仅成为一个好的执行者更重要。

关于提问和获得的三个关键点：
1.  **提问是获得的开始：** 它启动一个独特的过程，其工作原理可能不需完全理解，只需知道它有效即可，就像按下按钮启动机器一样。
2.  **获得本身不是问题：** 获得是自动发生的，真正的问题在于未能有效提问或提问不当（例如，努力工作却没有设定明确目标）。
3.  **获得是充裕的（像海洋）：** 成功和机会并非短缺或限量供应。问题在于人们往往只用“茶匙”去面对像海洋一样丰盛的资源，而非用“水桶”。需要扩大获取的范围或能力。

有效提问的两种方式：
1.  **带着智慧去提问：** 要求清晰、具体、明确地定义和描述你想要的东西（例如：尺寸、颜色、时间等细节）。清晰具体的目标能像磁铁一样吸引你。
2.  **带着信念去提问：** 像孩子一样相信你能得到你想要的东西，而不是像持怀疑态度的成年人。成功的公式是：像成年人一样制定计划，像孩子一样相信这些计划。

结论和行动号召：尝试将“像成年人一样计划，像孩子一样相信”这一方法实践 90 天。世界钦佩那些付诸行动的人。

**核心观点**

获得你想要的一切的核心在于：像成年人一样明智地规划并清晰地提问，同时像孩子一样坚定地相信你能够实现。

**总体框架**

该内容构建的总体框架是：

1.  **核心原则：** 提问是获取的根本。
2.  **获取过程的本质：** 提问启动过程；获得是自动且充裕的（而非稀缺的）。
3.  **获取的主要障碍：** 未能有效提问或以局限的方式（茶匙）对待无限的资源（海洋）。
4.  **有效提问的途径：** 结合智慧（清晰具体）与信念（像孩子一样相信）。
5.  **实践方法：** 成年人计划 + 孩子信念。
6.  **最终结果：** 获得想要的一切（丰盛）。
7.  **行动号召：** 实践并成为一个实干家。

 How to get whatever you want. That's the title of the next set of notes. How to get whatever you want. Here's what it says if you're ready. It says, ask. That's it. End of notes. Ask. If there's one art in life to learn extremely well, that's got to be one of them. The art of asking. What does ask mean? Ask means. What do you want? And the formula's staggering. It says ask and what? A guy ought to look into that. LAUGHTER See, you've got to be better than a good worker. You've got to be a good asker. Now let me give you three key points on asking and receiving. This can do it. Number one. Asking is the beginning of receiving. Asking starts a unique process. Mental and emotional. I don't even know how it works. All I know is it works. It's like pushing a button and all this machinery starts working. I don't know how. It just works. There's a lot of things. You don't need to know how. Just work them. Some people are always studying the roots. Others are picking the fruit. I mean, it depends on what end of it you want in on. Asking is the beginning of receiving. So start the process. Here's number two. Receiving is not the problem. Receiving is automatic. Now if that's true, receiving is not the problem. What's the problem? Failure to ask might be one of your major problems. I don't know. Check it out. The guy says, oh, now I see it. I got up last year and hit it every day. But there's not a scrap of paper with my goals. Good work. Poor ask. So you've got to change that. Here's number three. Receiving is like the ocean. There's plenty. Success is not in short supply. It isn't rationed. And you stepped up to the window and it was all gone. No, no, no. It's like an ocean here. Now if that's true, what's the problem? Well, some people go to the ocean with a teaspoon. Have you got the picture? See what you want to do in view of the size of the ocean is trade your teaspoon for at least a bucket. And you'll look better down at the ocean. Kids won't make fun of you, right? Okay. Now there's two ways to ask and we'll wrap up goal setting. Two ways. Here's number one. Ask with intelligence. It didn't say ask intelligently, but I'm sure it meant that. Don't mumble. You don't get anything but mumbling. Be clear. Be specific. Intelligent asking means how wide, how high, how soon. When, what size, what color, how much? Define what you want and describe what you want. That's powerful. Goals become like a magnet. They pull you that direction. And the better you describe them, the more they pull. So ask intelligently. Here's number two. Ask with faith. That's the childish part of the equation. Believe you can get what you want like a child. Not an adult. Adults are too skeptical. So the formula really reads, make plans like an adult, and believe in them like a child. And the most incredible things will happen. Just try it for 90 days. Just try it. You can always go back to the old ways. Just try it just 90 days, 90 days. The world admires the doers.
