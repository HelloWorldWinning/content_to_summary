以下是对原文的总结，并满足您的各项要求：

**如何得到你想要的一切 - 总结**

本文的核心思想围绕着“提出请求”（Ask）这一行为展开，认为它是获得人生所求的关键艺术。许多人专注于勤奋工作，却忽略了有效提出请求的重要性。

**核心要点概览:**

1.  **请求是开端：** 提出请求是获得任何事物的起点，它启动了一个内在的过程。
2.  **获得是自动的：** 获得本身并非问题，它就像一种自动机制。真正的问题在于“未能提出请求”。
3.  **机会充足：** 获得的机会和成功就像海洋一样广阔充足，问题在于你用什么去承载（是茶匙还是桶）。

**如何有效提出请求:**

1.  **带着智慧问：** 要求清晰、具体，明确定义你想要什么（例如，尺寸、颜色、数量等）。详细的目标像磁铁一样具有吸引力。
2.  **带着信心问：** 像孩子一样纯粹地相信你能得到它，克服成年人的怀疑。

**最终的结论点:**

获得你想要的一切的核心是学会提出清晰、具体且充满信心的请求。

**贯穿全文的框架:**

1.  **确定核心行动:** 强调“提出请求”是最重要的行动。
2.  **解释其重要性/原理:** 通过三个关键点说明提出请求为何有效以及未能请求为何是问题。
3.  **提供执行方法:** 给出有效提出请求的两种具体方式（智慧与信心）。
4.  **总结行动指南:** 将方法整合成一个公式，并提出实践挑战。
5.  **指向最终结果:** 有效的请求导向获得你想要的一切。

 How to get whatever you want. That's the title of the next set of notes. How to get whatever you want. Here's what it says if you're ready. It says, ask. That's it. End of notes. Ask. If there's one art in life to learn extremely well, that's got to be one of them. The art of asking. What does ask mean? Ask means. What do you want? And the formula's staggering. It says ask and what? A guy ought to look into that. Hahaha. See, you've got to be better than a good worker. You've got to be a good asker. Now let me give you three key points on asking and receiving. This can do it. Number one. Asking is the beginning of receiving. Asking starts a unique process. Mental and emotional. I don't even know how it works. All I know is it works. It's like pushing a button and all this machinery starts working. I don't know how. It just works. There's a lot of things you don't need to know how. Just work them. Some people are always studying the roots. Others are picking the fruit. I mean it depends on what end of it you want in on. Asking is the beginning of receiving. So start the process. Here's number two. Receiving is not the problem. Receiving is automatic. Now if that's true, receiving is not the problem. What's the problem? Failure to ask might be one of your major problems. I don't know. Check it out. The guy says, oh now I see it. I got up last year and hit it every day. But there's not a scrap of paper with my goals. Good work. Poor ask. So you've got to change that. Here's number three. Receiving is like the ocean. There's plenty. Success is not in short supply. It isn't rationed. And you stepped up to the window and it was all gone. No, no, no. It's like an ocean here. Now if that's true, what's the problem? Well some people go to the ocean with a teaspoon. Have you got the picture? See what you want to do in view of the size of the ocean is trade your teaspoon for at least a bucket. And you'll look better down at the ocean. Kids won't make fun of you, right? Okay. Now there's two ways to ask and we'll wrap up goal setting. Two ways. Here's number one. Ask with intelligence. It didn't say ask intelligently, but I'm sure it meant that. Don't mumble. You don't get anything but mumbling. Be clear. Be specific. Intelligent asking means how wide, how high, how soon. When, what size, what color, how much. Define what you want and describe what you want. That's powerful. Goals become like a magnet. They pull you that direction and the better you describe them the more they pull. So ask intelligently. Here's number two. Ask with faith. That's the childish part of the equation. Believe you can get what you want like a child. Not an adult. Adults are too skeptical. So the formula really reads, make plans like an adult and believe in them like a child. And the most incredible things will happen. Just try it for 90 days. Just try it. You can always go back to the old ways. Just try it just 90 days, 90 days. The world admires the doers. The world is the only way to do it. The world is the only way to do it. The world is the only way to do it. The world is the only way to do it. The world is the only way to do it. The world is the only way to do it. The world is the only way to do it. The world is the only way to do it. The world is the only way to do it. The world is the only way to do it. The world is the only way to do it. The world is the only way to do it. The world is the only way to do it.
