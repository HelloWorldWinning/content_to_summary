Description:
好的，下面是您要求的文本摘要，包括大纲、核心结论、总体框架以及 Mermaid 流程图：

**摘要大纲：**

1.  **引言：** 讨论模拟理论，高级文明创造逼真模拟的可能性。
2.  **个人经历：** 关于模拟讨论过于频繁，甚至被禁止。
3.  **核心论点：**
    *   40年前游戏（Pong）与现在的照片级3D模拟游戏的巨大进步。
    *   假设未来游戏无限逼真，与现实无法区分。
    *   如果有无数的计算机运行这些游戏，那么我们身处“真实”世界的概率极低（十亿分之一）。
4.  **逻辑推论：**
    *   要么我们创造出无限逼真的模拟，要么文明会因为某种灾难而停止发展。
    *   如果我们在模拟中，可能更好，因为文明可能遭遇灾难，模拟可以重启。
5.  **总结：** 赞同身处模拟世界的可能性，认为概率极高。

**核心结论：**

我们身处“真实”世界的概率极低，更有可能生活在一个高级文明创造的模拟世界中。

**总体框架：**

该内容构建了一个基于技术进步和概率论的论证，用以支持“我们生活在模拟中”的理论。它从游戏技术的飞速发展入手，推断未来模拟技术的可能性，进而得出我们身处模拟世界的概率远高于现实世界的结论。

 There's a sort of a philosophic concept that a sufficiently advanced civilization will be able to create Simulation yeah, maybe you've answered this before a Simulation so many simulation discussions. It's crazy. Okay, so because in fact it got to the point where basically every conversation was Was the ais AI slash simulation conversation? And my brother and I finally agreed that we would ban such conversations if we're ever in a hot tub that was like There cuz that really kills the magic so So so the idea is right any sufficiently advanced civilization would create could create a simulation That's like our existence and so the theory follows that May maybe we're in the simulation Have you thought about this and a lot are we Are we even in hot tub so much so it had to be banned from a hot tub Yeah Okay, it's not the sexiest conversation are we in are we in? the I Think his environment like the strongest argument for the for us being in a simulation probably being a simulation I think is the following That that 40 called 40 40 years ago. We had pong like two rectangles in a dot that was what games were Now 40 years later we have photo realistic 3d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it's getting better every year and soon we'll have But you know virtual reality of augmented reality If you assume any rate of improvement at all Then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just in the instinctable Even if that rate of advancement drops by a thousand from what it is right now Then you just say okay. Well, let's imagine it's a 10,000 years in the future, which is nothing in the evolutionary scale so So given that we're clearly our trajectory to have games that are indistinguishable from reality And those games could be played on any set-top box or on a PC or whatever and they would probably be You know billions of such You know computers of set-top boxes It would Seem to follow that the odds that we're in base reality is one in billions Tell me what's wrong with that argument is the answer. Yes The argument is probably I mean, it's like is there is there a flow in that argument? I mean so much, but someone I'm not sure what the error. No no the argument makes sense. So the assumption then is that Somebody beat us to it and this is a game. No, no, there's a one in billions chance that this is base reality. Oh, okay What do you think? Well, I think it's one in billions. Okay I mean this that seems to be like clearly what the you know what what what suggests and actually I mean arguably we should hope that that's true because otherwise if Civilization stops advancing then that may be due to some calamitous event that erase the civilization so maybe we should be hopeful that this is a simulation because Otherwise they could reboot it. Well otherwise Eat either we're gonna create simulations that are industry industrial from reality or civilization will cease to exist those are the two options
