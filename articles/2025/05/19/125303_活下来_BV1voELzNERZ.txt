 While others were free to grow, you were fighting to survive. Your mind was learning how to stay safe while theirs was learning how to thrive. That's not your fault. Those without deep trauma had a different path. They could focus on dreams while you focused on making it through each day. They could plan futures while you were healing past wounds. You're not behind. You're not slow. You were just carrying weights they never had to lift. Your energy went to survival while theirs went to growth. If you feel like you're playing catch-up now, remember why. Remember what you overcame. Remember how strong you had to be just to make it here. Your path was harder. Your road was longer. But your survival shows your strength. You're not late to life. You're right on time for your journey.
