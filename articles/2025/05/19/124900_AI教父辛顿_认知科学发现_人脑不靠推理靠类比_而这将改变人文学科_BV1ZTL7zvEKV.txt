Description:
好的，我将按照要求总结并生成相关内容。

**内容概要：**

1.  **核心观点：** 随着对大脑工作原理的理解加深，我们对人性的看法将发生根本性的改变，我们将认识到人类主要依靠类比进行思考，而非逻辑推理。

2.  **主要框架：**
    *   **历史回顾：** 心理分析的出现曾改变人们对人性的理解，使我们接受了无意识动机和类比思维。
    *   **未来展望：** 对大脑工作原理更深入的了解将引发更大的变革。
    *   **核心论点：** 长期以来，人们认为人类是理性的，运用逻辑进行推理，但实际上，人类更像是“类比机器”。
    *   **类比的重要性：** 类比思维是人类思考的基础，逻辑推理只是表层的一小部分，但对于某些领域（如数学和金融）至关重要。
    *   **对人性的影响：** 认识到类比思维的重要性将改变我们对人性的认知。

3.  **总体的框架:** 主要是 *对比* 和 *递进* 的关系。首先是*心理分析的对比*和*现在大脑科学理解的递进*，然后是 *理性思维的对比*和*类比思维的递进*，最后引申到*大脑科学研究*最终会对*人性的理解*产生*递进式*的改变。

Content:
 As we develop more understanding of how the brain works, we're going to radically change our view of how people work and that's going to change the humanities. We saw that once about 100 years ago, with the development of psychoanalysis, even though there was a lot of nonsense combined with some real insights, that changed the way people thought about people. We accepted that we have all sorts of unconscious motivations. We accepted that we use all sorts of analogies to do things, rather than just reasoning. We basically accepted that we were much less rational than we thought. This is an even bigger change that's going to happen, because up until now, most people, including in the humanities, have thought that we sort of reason using something like logic. We're rational beings. We're not. We're great big analogy machines. We work by seeing analogies. Analogies is not just with one thing, but with lots of things. And so that changes what you think of as the nature of a person. We're analogy machines rather than reasoning machines. We've got a thin layer of reasoning on the top, and that's very important for doing things like mathematics. Without the reasoning on top, you couldn't have bank accounts and things. But we basically use analogies to think.
