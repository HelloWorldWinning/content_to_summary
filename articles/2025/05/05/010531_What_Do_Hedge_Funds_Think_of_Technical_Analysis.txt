好的，这是对提供的文本的提炼和总结，包括大纲结构、核心结论、总体框架和概念图：

**总结**

**一、 大纲结构**

1.  **引言：**
    *   对技术分析在对冲基金中的看法存在分歧。
    *   介绍不同人士的观点，包括前对冲基金经理、交易员和投资组合经理。
2.  **对冲基金经理的观点：**
    *   **Corvin:**
        *   技术分析的定义需要明确。
        *   可测试性是关键，规则必须明确且可复制。
        *   如果某种方法有效，即使不符合标准，也应予以考虑。
    *   **David Paul:**
        *   机构交易者在关键水平买入，而散户交易者等待确认。
        *   散户交易者的止损常被机构利用。
        *   强调入场点的重要性，止损应根据市场波动性设置。
    *   **Mark:**
        *   大型对冲基金不依赖技术分析，更关注基本面。
        *   小型对冲基金可能使用技术分析来辅助决策。
        *   交易员可能在执行订单时考虑支撑和阻力位。
    *   **Andre:**
        *   反对设置过紧的止损。
        *   强调对交易的信心，建议设置较大的止损空间。
        *   止损应根据市场情况和个人风险承受能力调整。
3.  **核心概念：**
    *   止损狩猎
    *   流动性陷阱
    *   机构级别交易
4.  **结论：**
    *   对冲基金对技术分析的看法因规模和策略而异。
    *   技术分析可以作为辅助工具，但不是决策的唯一依据。

most retail Traders will unfortunately most retail Traders will wait for some confirmation before they wait for some confirmation before they wait for some confirmation before they get in that could be a candle pattern get in that could be a candle pattern get in that could be a candle pattern could be a moving average Cross could be a moving average Cross could be a moving average Cross or whatever institutional Traders will or whatever institutional Traders will or whatever institutional Traders will buy at the level now most Traders will buy at the level now most Traders will buy at

will invariably put last low and they will invariably put their stop loss at exactly where the their stop loss at exactly where the their stop loss at exactly where the institutional orders are I think that institutional orders are I think that institutional orders are I think that institutional Traders are just doing institutional Traders are just doing institutional Traders are just doing with institutional Traders do putting with institutional Traders do putting with institutional Traders do putting their entry points at very good levels their entry points at very good levels their

got and on occasions to actually got and on occasions to actually generate the liquid ability to get generate the liquid ability to get generate the liquid ability to get aboard I don't think that anybody looks aboard I don't think that anybody looks aboard I don't think that anybody looks at where the stops are but they will say at where the stops are but they will say at where the stops are but they will say to themselves well we know pretty sure to themselves well we know pretty sure to themselves well we know pretty sure that most of the stops will all be that most of the stops will all be that most of the stops will all be crowded around this obvious level so crowded around this obvious level so crowded around this obvious level so they will bid the market at that they will bid the market at that they will bid the market at that particular level all you need is one particular level all you need is one particular level all you need is one person to chicken out and the markets person to chicken out and the markets person to chicken out and the markets are going to go where the bids are and are going to go where the bids are and are going to go where the bids are and all those people will be taken out if all those people will be taken out if all those people will be taken out if you do not think long and hard about you do not think long and hard about you do not think long and hard about where you're going to put your stops where you're going to put your stops where you're going to put your stops that you're going to find that you can that you're going to find that you can that you're going to find that you can quite easily die in a sea of stop losses quite easily die in a sea of stop losses quite easily die in a sea of stop losses and here's an exercise for some people and here's an exercise for some people and here's an exercise for some people the next time you're just about to put a the next time you're just about to put a the next time you're just about to put a tread on you pick up something heavy and tread on you pick up something heavy and tread on you pick up something heavy and you just go you just go you just go foreign foreign foreign and then you write down a piece of paper and then you write down a piece of paper and then you write down a piece of paper where you were going to buy and where where you were going to buy and where where you were going to buy and where you're going to put your stop loss don't you're going to put your stop loss don't you're going to put your stop loss don't buy it but put an order in to buy it at buy it but put an order in to buy it at buy it but put an order in to buy it at where you're going to put your stop loss where you're going to put your stop loss where you're going to put your stop loss and then just watch how many times the and then just watch how many times the and then just watch how many times the market goes to your order markets I will market goes to your order markets I will market goes to your order markets I will go to the obvious stops most of the time go to the obvious stops most of the time go to the obvious stops most of the time and one of my rules is that I want to and one of my rules is that I want to and one of my rules is that I want to put my entries where the masses put put my entries where the masses put put my entries where the masses put their stops if you don't get in at a their stops if you don't get in at a their stops if you don't get in at a good level there's nothing that upsets good level there's nothing that upsets good level there's nothing that upsets me more than a guy saying that this is a me more than a guy saying that this is a me more than a guy saying that this is a very risky trade I'll use a tight stop very risky trade I'll use a tight stop very risky trade I'll use a tight stop loss that's just rubbish because uh loss that's just rubbish because uh loss that's just rubbish because uh you'll get stopped out over and over and you'll get stopped out over and over and you'll get stopped out over and over and over again the stop needs to be where over again the stop needs to be where over again the stop needs to be where the stop needs to be so if your entry is the stop needs to be so if your entry is the stop needs to be so if your entry is sloppy then your stop loss is going to sloppy then your stop loss is going to sloppy then your stop loss is going to have to be a red bus away from where you have to be a red bus away from where you have to be a red bus away from where you got in at to give yourself a chance of got in at to give yourself a chance of got in at to give yourself a chance of staying in the move the average true staying in the move the average true staying in the move the average true range will help with that most Traders range will help with that most Traders range will help with that most Traders will look at a stop loss of two and a will look at a stop loss of two and a will look at a stop loss of two and a half times the average true range or half times the average true range or half times the average true range or something like that nevertheless if you something like that nevertheless if you something like that nevertheless if you want to get in with low stop losses at want to get in with low stop losses at want to get in with low stop losses at institutional levels you've got to be institutional levels you've got to be institutional levels you've got to be brave the institutional Traders will use brave the institutional Traders will use brave the institutional Traders will use Fibonacci levels they will use trend Fibonacci levels they will use trend Fibonacci levels they will use trend lines they'll use Simple horizontal lines they'll use Simple horizontal lines they'll use Simple horizontal support and resistance levels to support and resistance levels to support and resistance levels to actually look for confluences to try and actually look for confluences to try and actually look for confluences to try and place their orders nothing clever okay place their orders nothing clever okay place their orders nothing clever okay unfortunately most retail Traders as I unfortunately most retail Traders as I unfortunately most retail Traders as I say will look for some form of say will look for some form of say will look for some form of Confirmation and a desktop loss will Confirmation and a desktop loss will Confirmation and a desktop loss will then be too close and you'll get taken then be too close and you'll get taken then be too close and you'll get taken out in the noise David made some really out in the noise David made some really out in the noise David made some really great points unlike you and me a huge great points unlike you and me a huge great points unlike you and me a huge institution can't just buy in at any institution can't just buy in at any institution can't just buy in at any given time they have so much money there given time they have so much money there given time they have so much money there isn't enough liquidity out there so they isn't enough liquidity out there so they isn't enough liquidity out there so they can organically enter at the given price can organically enter at the given price can organically enter at the given price they want in order for them to get in at they want in order for them to get in at they want in order for them to get in at the price they want they need to create the price they want they need to create the price they want they need to create the liquidity themselves which in return the liquidity themselves which in return the liquidity themselves which in return means making price hit these huge areas means making price hit these huge areas means making price hit these huge areas of stop losses and buying in at that of stop losses and buying in at that of stop losses and buying in at that point that's why in a lot of my video point that's why in a lot of my video point that's why in a lot of my video strategies like this one fake outs and strategies like this one fake outs and strategies like this one fake outs and liquidity grabs are huge part of the liquidity grabs are huge part of the liquidity grabs are huge part of the success of the strategy because it's success of the strategy because it's success of the strategy because it's hitting all these Traders stop losses hitting all these Traders stop losses hitting all these Traders stop losses and you're essentially trading with the and you're essentially trading with the and you're essentially trading with the big money another quote I really liked big money another quote I really liked big money another quote I really liked from him was the stop loss needs to be from him was the stop loss needs to be from him was the stop loss needs to be where the stop loss needs to be you where the stop loss needs to be you where the stop loss needs to be you shouldn't just make a stop loss small shouldn't just make a stop loss small shouldn't just make a stop loss small because you don't want to take on a lot because you don't want to take on a lot because you don't want to take on a lot of risk if you're taking up a lot of of risk if you're taking up a lot of of risk if you're taking up a lot of risk it's because your entry wasn't good risk it's because your entry wasn't good risk it's because your entry wasn't good so really pay attention to that next so really pay attention to that next so really pay attention to that next time you enter a trade the next time you enter a trade the next time you enter a trade the next interview we're going to look at is Mark interview we're going to look at is Mark interview we're going to look at is Mark an algorithmic Trader that worked with a an algorithmic Trader that worked with a an algorithmic Trader that worked with a bunch of different small hedge funds now bunch of different small hedge funds now bunch of different small hedge funds now the main topic he is talking about is if the main topic he is talking about is if the main topic he is talking about is if hedge funds use support and resistances hedge funds use support and resistances hedge funds use support and resistances to help make trading decisions and this to help make trading decisions and this to help make trading decisions and this answer kind of surprised me the question answer kind of surprised me the question answer kind of surprised me the question is this if we are thinking of hedge is this if we are thinking of hedge is this if we are thinking of hedge funds are they taking support resistance funds are they taking support resistance funds are they taking support resistance into account before they're taking a into account before they're taking a into account before they're taking a placing a trade or an investment now placing a trade or an investment now placing a trade or an investment now it's important to kind of distinguish it's important to kind of distinguish it's important to kind of distinguish here what we're talking about I would here what we're talking about I would here what we're talking about I would Hazard a guess that hedge funds at the Hazard a guess that hedge funds at the Hazard a guess that hedge funds at the very top end like your Bridgewater like very top end like your Bridgewater like very top end like your Bridgewater like any kind of really big fun that's any kind of really big fun that's any kind of really big fun that's managing a massive amount of money managing a massive amount of money managing a massive amount of money really doesn't care about this because really doesn't care about this because really doesn't care about this because unless they've got a sub fund that's unless they've got a sub fund that's unless they've got a sub fund that's very technical and small which I don't very technical and small which I don't very technical and small which I don't think they have because they've got so think they have because they've got so think they have because they've got so much money wouldn't make any sense they much money wouldn't make any sense they much money wouldn't make any sense they don't care about this because they're don't care about this because they're don't care about this because they're holding times are much longer they're holding times are much longer they're holding times are much longer they're much more interested in different things much more interested in different things much more interested in different things which we'll get to in a second so they which we'll get to in a second so they which we'll get to in a second so they don't but then when we go down to the don't but then when we go down to the don't but then when we go down to the smaller end of the scale like people who smaller end of the scale like people who smaller end of the scale like people who are still running funds the couple that are still running funds the couple that are still running funds the couple that I've worked with have taken it into I've worked with have taken it into I've worked with have taken it into account because they're not 100 Man team account because they're not 100 Man team account because they're not 100 Man team they're a small team managing a decent they're a small team managing a decent they're a small team managing a decent amount of money but a modest amount when amount of money but a modest amount when amount of money but a modest amount when you compare it
