My goal here is just to to help you guys My goal here is just to to help you guys My goal here is just to to help you guys and get you that, you know, first step and get you that, you know, first step and get you that, you know, first step forward faster than what I did. So, my forward faster than what I did. So, my forward faster than what I did. So, my first biggest regret of algo trading is first biggest regret of algo trading is first biggest regret of algo trading is overriding my trades. When I first overriding my trades. When I first overriding my trades. When I first started and even a couple years ago, I started and even a couple years ago, I started and even a couple years ago, I think last year, I've overrided my think last year, I've overrided my think last year, I've overrided my trades trades trades um a couple times. Meaning that my um a couple times. Meaning that my um a couple times. Meaning that my automated trading system would submit a automated trading system would submit a automated trading system would submit a say a profit target order, right? it say a profit target order, right? it say a profit target order, right? it would still be in a position, but I would still be in a position, but I would still be in a position, but I would manually go in and close it would manually go in and close it would manually go in and close it because I was too scared. Maybe I because I was too scared. Maybe I because I was too scared. Maybe I thought I had too many long positions thought I had too many long positions thought I had too many long positions on. Maybe Jerome Powell was was going to on. Maybe Jerome Powell was was going to on. Maybe Jerome Powell was was going to speak and I was scared what he was going speak and I was scared what he was going speak and I was scared what he was going to say and I would sell my to say and I would sell my to say and I would sell my position. And I actually tracked I position. And I actually tracked I position. And I actually tracked I wouldn't say all of my trades because wouldn't say all of my trades because wouldn't say all of my trades because there there's ones that you know when I there there's ones that you know when I there there's ones that you know when I first started I just didn't track first started I just didn't track first started I just didn't track because I was lazy, but I tracked most because I was lazy, but I tracked most because I was lazy, but I tracked most of them. And at the end of uh uh last of them. And at the end of uh uh last of them. And at the end of uh uh last year and year and year and 2023, I netted up all the uh all the 2023, I netted up all the uh all the 2023, I netted up all the uh all the overrides and it cost me money. Meaning overrides and it cost me money. Meaning overrides and it cost me money. Meaning that my my decisions cost me net profit. that my my decisions cost me net profit. that my my decisions cost me net profit. So that's my first regret. Overriding So that's my first regret. Overriding So that's my first regret. Overriding trades. It cost me money. I missed out trades. It cost me money. I missed out trades. It cost me money. I missed out on a lot of gains by closing too early. on a lot of gains by closing too early. on a lot of gains by closing too early. And you know, I should have just let my And you know, I should have just let my And you know, I should have just let my alos run. That was one of the costly alos run. That was one of the costly alos run. That was one of the costly mistakes that I made overriding my mistakes that I made overriding my mistakes that I made overriding my trades. And I know it's hard. you know, trades. And I know it's hard. you know, trades. And I know it's hard. you know, it's you start running algos and you see it's you start running algos and you see it's you start running algos and you see the P&amp; Ls go up and down and it's your the P&amp; Ls go up and down and it's your the P&amp; Ls go up and down and it's your money and you get scared, right? You see money and you get scared, right? You see money and you get scared, right? You see two or three algos enter at once and two or three algos enter at once and two or three algos enter at once and you're like, "Oh crap. " You know, you're you're like, "Oh crap. " You know, you're you're like, "Oh crap. " You know, you're seeing you're seeing volatility and seeing you're seeing volatility and seeing you're seeing volatility and you're seeing what the market to trade you're seeing what the market to trade you're seeing what the market to trade it is like. Um, and you want to go in it is like. Um, and you want to go in it is like. Um, and you want to go in and close this positions. You know, and close this positions. You know, and close this positions. You know, usually you want to clone close the the usually you want to clone close the the usually you want to clone close the the green positions and you'll let the red green positions and you'll let the red green positions and you'll let the red positions run because maybe they'll positions run because maybe they'll positions run because maybe they'll bounce back. And I can tell you now it's bounce back. And I can tell you now it's bounce back. And I can tell you now it's it's costly. I uh I don't do it. All it's costly. I uh I don't do it. All it's costly. I uh I don't do it. All right. Do not override your trades. Do right. Do not override your trades. Do right. Do not override your trades. Do not I I found that what helped is I not I I found that what helped is I not I I found that what helped is I don't look at my trades while the don't look at my trades while the don't look at my trades while the market's open. Okay? Maybe once in a market's open. Okay? Maybe once in a market's open. Okay? Maybe once in a while to make sure everything's running while to make sure everything's running while to make sure everything's running correctly, but when you stare at charts correctly, but when you stare at charts correctly, but when you stare at charts or P&amp; Ls, you're more inclined to or P&amp; Ls, you're more inclined to or P&amp; Ls, you're more inclined to override that trade. So, just don't look override that trade. So, just don't look override that trade. So, just don't look at it. All right? I just check my at it. All right? I just check my at it. All right? I just check my positions on market open and market positions on market open and market positions on market open and market close to make sure that I'm in I'm in close to make sure that I'm in I'm in close to make sure that I'm in I'm in all sync. I'm synced up and all my all sync. I'm synced up and all my all sync. I'm synced up and all my positions are good. And then that's it. positions are good. And then that's it. positions are good. And then that's it. You know, don't be staring at charts all You know, don't be staring at charts all You know, don't be staring at charts all day. It's a waste of time. Anyways, so day. It's a waste of time. Anyways, so day. It's a waste of time. Anyways, so my first regret is don't override my first regret is don't override my first regret is don't override trades. My second regret is trading too trades. My second regret is trading too trades. My second regret is trading too much of the same much of the same much of the same market. About a year ago or two years market. About a year ago or two years market. About a year ago or two years ago, I used to have 20 systems that ago, I used to have 20 systems that ago, I used to have 20 systems that traded NQ. And I've talked about this traded NQ. And I've talked about this traded NQ. And I've talked about this before, but it worked really well for before, but it worked really well for before, but it worked really well for 2023, but it just did not work in 2024. 2023, but it just did not work in 2024. 2023, but it just did not work in 2024. and now just too correlated in the and now just too correlated in the and now just too correlated in the NASDAQ market. Uh and and took some big NASDAQ market. Uh and and took some big NASDAQ market. Uh and and took some big correlated losses which were painful to correlated losses which were painful to correlated losses which were painful to see. Uh so my biggest regret was not see. Uh so my biggest regret was not see. Uh so my biggest regret was not being diverse enough in my trading being diverse enough in my trading being diverse enough in my trading systems and being too granular focused systems and being too granular focused systems and being too granular focused on NQ. Uh as you guys know, I trade on NQ. Uh as you guys know, I trade on NQ. Uh as you guys know, I trade futures and NASDAQ futures NQ the NASDAQ futures and NASDAQ futures NQ the NASDAQ futures and NASDAQ futures NQ the NASDAQ E- Mini is one of the most volatile E- Mini is one of the most volatile E- Mini is one of the most volatile products out there to trade, which means products out there to trade, which means products out there to trade, which means potentially it could make you the most potentially it could make you the most potentially it could make you the most money. But you have to think money. But you have to think money. But you have to think about potentially it can make you the about potentially it can make you the about potentially it can make you the most money can also potentially uh lose most money can also potentially uh lose most money can also potentially uh lose you the most money due to its you the most money due to its you the most money due to its volatility. If you're on the wrong side volatility. If you're on the wrong side volatility. If you're on the wrong side of the trade and you're short and it it of the trade and you're short and it it of the trade and you're short and it it starts pumping up, you're going to take starts pumping up, you're going to take starts pumping up, you're going to take a big loss, right? So one of my regrets a big loss, right? So one of my regrets a big loss, right? So one of my regrets was trading too many NQ products and um was trading too many NQ products and um was trading too many NQ products and um you know I will never do that again. you know I will never do that again. you know I will never do that again. It's important to be diverse. So that's It's important to be diverse. So that's It's important to be diverse. So that's my second ALGO my second ALGO my second ALGO regret. My third ALGO regret was making regret. My third ALGO regret was making regret. My third ALGO regret was making too many changes to my portfolio. you too many changes to my portfolio. you too many changes to my portfolio. you know, constantly tweaking, adding and know, constantly tweaking, adding and know, constantly tweaking, adding and removing bots on a weekly or monthly removing bots on a weekly or monthly removing bots on a weekly or monthly basis. It was just too much. And, you basis. It was just too much. And, you basis. It was just too much. And, you know, changing it up too much poses a know, changing it up too much poses a know, changing it up too much poses a lot of problems. The biggest problem is lot of problems. The biggest problem is lot of problems. The biggest problem is that it's hard to track things and how that it's hard to track things and how that it's hard to track things and how they would have done with all the they would have done with all the they would have done with all the changes you made. Um, and you know, it changes you made. Um, and you know, it changes you made. Um, and you know, it just got too confusing on what the just got too confusing on what the just got too confusing on what the portfolio was and tracking all the portfolio was and tracking all the portfolio was and tracking all the numbers. I was changing on a weekly numbers. I was changing on a weekly numbers. I was changing on a weekly basis. So, that basis. So, that basis. So, that uh that's a big regret for me changing uh that's a big regret for me changing uh that's a big regret for me changing it too often. And of course, you need to it too often. And of course, you need to it too often. And of course, you need to make changes to the portfolio. You know, make changes to the portfolio. You know, make changes to the portfolio. You know, you need to add or remove systems that you need to add or remove systems that you need to add or remove systems that you think are worthy. you think are worthy. you think are worthy. Um, but you don't have to do it on a Um, but you don't have to do it on a Um, but you don't have to do it on a frequent basis. Uh, for me personally, frequent basis. Uh, for me personally, frequent basis. Uh, for me personally, I'm only making changes maybe every I'm only making changes maybe every I'm only making changes maybe every quarter, once every quarter. In terms of quarter, once every quarter. In terms of quarter, once every quarter. In terms of adding systems, removing systems, I'm adding systems, removing systems, I'm adding systems, removing systems, I'm only removing them on a yearly only removing them on a yearly only removing them on a yearly basis. Uh, or sorry, I should I should basis. Uh, or sorry, I should I should basis. Uh, or sorry, I should I should clarify. I'm removing the system if it's clarify. I'm removing the system if it's clarify. I'm removing the system if it's traded longer than a year. So it could traded longer than a year. So it could traded longer than a year. So it could be more than than once a year but you be more than than once a year but you be more than than once a year but you know it's it's infrequent. So making too know it's it's infrequent. So making too know it's it's infrequent. So making too many changes to portfolio causes many changes to portfolio causes many changes to portfolio causes confusion confusion confusion in you know logging in the numbers in you know logging in the numbers in you know logging in the numbers monitoring the systems and it's just monitoring the systems and it's just monitoring the systems and it's just yeah it's uh you want to make changes yeah it's uh you want to make changes yeah it's uh you want to make changes just not too just not too just not too frequently. The next regret I have is frequently. The next regret I have is frequently. The next regret I have is not putting enough time to not putting enough time to not putting enough time to documenting my numbers. So, my daily documenting my numbers. So, my daily documenting my numbers. So, my daily returns, draw downs, uh just kind of leg returns, draw downs, uh just kind of leg returns, draw downs, uh just kind of leg work in terms of accounting, if you work in terms of accounting, if you work in terms of accounting, if you will. I do log my numbers every day, but will. I do log my numbers every day, but will. I do log my numbers every day, but I would cut corners, you know, I would I would cut corners, you know, I would I would cut corners, you know, I would put off some days. If I was having a bad put off some days. If I was having a bad put off some days. If I was having a bad month or or a bad week, I wouldn't be, month or or a bad week, I wouldn't be, month or or a bad week, I wouldn't be, you know, be skipping days and going you know, be skipping days and going you know, be skipping days and going back and fixing them. And, you know, back and fixing them. And, you know, back and fixing them. And, you know, just not really taking a a professional just not really taking a a professional just not really taking a a professional approach in terms of logging my numbers approach in terms of logging my numbers approach in terms of logging my numbers on a daily basis. Honestly, you don't on a daily basis. Honestly, you don't on a daily basis. Honestly, you don't need to log your numbers on a daily need to log your numbers on a daily need to log your numbers on a daily basis. I actually do it weekly now. I basis. I actually do it weekly now. I basis. I actually do it weekly now. I found out that daily was a little bit found out that daily was a little bit found out that daily was a little bit too stressful for me and uh it also too stressful for me and uh it also too stressful for me and uh it also takes a lot of time to log the numbers takes a lot of time to log the numbers takes a lot of time to log the numbers and just seeing that the P&amp; Ls change and just seeing that the P&amp; Ls change and just seeing that the P&amp; Ls change every day. I mean P&amp; Ls swing crazy every day. I mean P&amp; Ls swing crazy every day. I mean P&amp; Ls swing crazy daytoday. So uh I just do it on a weekly daytoday. So uh I just do it on a weekly daytoday. So uh I just do it on a weekly basis now where I go in usually on a basis now where I go in usually on a basis now where I go in usually on a Saturday or Sunday and my mentor Kevin Saturday or Sunday and my mentor Kevin Saturday or Sunday and my mentor Kevin Davey does this as well to to do the Davey does this as well to to do the Davey does this as well to to do the numbers. Um, but uh, yeah, just putting numbers. Um, but uh, yeah, just putting numbers. Um, but uh, yeah, just putting more professional approach in terms of more professional approach in terms of more professional approach in terms of accounting, logging your numbers, making accounting, logging your numbers, making accounting, logging your numbers, making sure there's no formula errors in your sure there's no formula errors in your sure there's no formula errors in your Excel sheet or Google Sheets, and just Excel sheet or Google Sheets, and just Excel sheet or Google Sheets, and just being professional with it. I think I being professional with it. I think I being professional with it. I think I was a bit lazy with it at the beginning, was a bit lazy with it at the beginning, was a bit lazy with it at the beginning, and it took me a while to to really pick and it took me a while to to really pick and it took me a while to to really pick it it it up. And then lastly, I'd say my last up. And then lastly, I'd say my last up. And then lastly, I'd say my last biggest regret with ALGO biggest regret with ALGO biggest regret with ALGO Trading was, let me see here. It's one I Trading was, let me see here. It's one I Trading was, let me see here. It's one I got to think about. I do these videos got to think about. I do these videos got to think about. I do these videos off the cuff. I don't really have a off the cuff. I don't really have a off the cuff. I don't really have a script, so it's a little bit more script, so it's a little bit more script, so it's a little bit more natural to me. I would say my next natural to me. I would say my next natural to me. I would say my next biggest biggest biggest regret would regret would regret would be sizing up too be sizing up too be sizing up too quickly. It it it sort of worked for a quickly. It it it sort of worked for a quickly. It it it sort of worked for a short period of time, but I quickly short period of time, but I quickly short period of time, but I quickly realized that the amount of size that I realized that the amount of size that I realized that the amount of size that I was trading, I couldn't actually handle was trading, I couldn't actually handle was trading, I couldn't actually handle in terms of volatility. in terms of volatility. in terms of volatility. And I wasn't really doing correct, I And I wasn't really doing correct, I And I wasn't really doing correct, I wouldn't say correct, but I wasn't wouldn't say correct, but I wasn't wouldn't say correct, but I wasn't measuring my risk in terms of the, you measuring my risk in terms of the, you measuring my risk in terms of the, you know, standard deviation or the variance know, standard deviation or the variance know, standard deviation or the variance of my returns from a day-to-day basis. of my returns from a day-to-day basis. of my returns from a day-to-day basis. Remember one time we were trading 20 Remember one time we were trading 20 Remember one time we were trading 20 contracts and uh we had a a massive day contracts and uh we had a a massive day contracts and uh we had a a massive day like we crushed it. Um and then we soon like we crushed it. Um and then we soon like we crushed it. Um and then we soon gave it all back because we realized the gave it all back because we realized the gave it all back because we realized the variance and standard deviation of our variance and standard deviation of our variance and standard deviation of our returns couldn't actually handle it. So returns couldn't actually handle it. So returns couldn't actually handle it. So that was a regret of mine. And I wish I that was a regret of mine. And I wish I that was a regret of mine. And I wish I slowly progressed, you know, one slowly progressed, you know, one slowly progressed, you know, one contract and then once I hit a level, contract and then once I hit a level, contract and then once I hit a level, two contracts, three contracts, etc. two contracts, three contracts, etc. two contracts, three contracts, etc. Slowly adding size to get to my desired Slowly adding size to get to my desired Slowly adding size to get to my desired result and desired result and desired result and desired goal. That's another big regret of mine goal. That's another big regret of mine goal. That's another big regret of mine as well. And I'll do a bonus regret, as well. And I'll do a bonus regret, as well. And I'll do a bonus regret, too, because I just thought of one right too, because I just thought of one right too, because I just thought of one right this second. My last regret is not this second. My last regret is not this second. My last regret is not setting a yearly goal. All right, not setting a yearly goal. All right, not setting a yearly goal. All right, not setting a yearly goal on how much I'm setting a yearly goal on how much I'm setting a yearly goal on how much I'm looking to make or risk, right? Am I looking to make or risk, right? Am I looking to make or risk, right? Am I looking to make 20% a year or 50% a year looking to make 20% a year or 50% a year looking to make 20% a year or 50% a year and risk 10 or 20%. I never set that and risk 10 or 20%. I never set that and risk 10 or 20%. I never set that goal and it never really positioned me goal and it never really positioned me goal and it never really positioned me to aim for something, right? If you set to aim for something, right? If you set to aim for something, right? If you set a goal, right, you know exactly where a goal, right, you know exactly where a goal, right, you know exactly where you want to be and where you're headed. you want to be and where you're headed. you want to be and where you're headed. Okay? And maybe if you hit that goal, Okay? And maybe if you hit that goal, Okay? And maybe if you hit that goal, you stop trading. That's just an idea. you stop trading. That's just an idea. you stop trading. That's just an idea. But never set a But never set a But never set a goal. Um, and I think that kind of put goal. Um, and I think that kind of put goal. Um, and I think that kind of put me off track, right? I wasn't really as me off track, right? I wasn't really as me off track, right? I wasn't really as focused as I should be because I didn't focused as I should be because I didn't focused as I should be because I didn't have a goal. So to all you out there, have a goal. So to all you out there, have a goal.
