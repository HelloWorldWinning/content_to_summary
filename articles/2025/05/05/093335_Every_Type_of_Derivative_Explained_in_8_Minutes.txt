WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en One classical derivative. To find the One classical derivative. To find the One classical derivative. To find the gradient or steepness of a line, you gradient or steepness of a line, you gradient or steepness of a line, you simply take the change in y divided by simply take the change in y divided by simply take the change in y divided by the change in x. So if y = f ofx= 2x + the change in x. So if y = f ofx= 2x + the change in x. So if y = f ofx= 2x + 1, the gradient is 2. But if the line is 1, the gradient is 2. But if the line is 1, the gradient is 2. But if the line is curved, like in f ofx= x^2, we do the curved, like in f ofx= x^2, we do the curved, like in f ofx= x^2, we do the same thing as before with the change in same thing as before with the change in same thing as before with the change in y / the change in x. But this time, the y / the change in x. But this time, the y / the change in x. But this time, the closer the x values are, the more closer the x values are, the more closer the x values are, the more accurate our answer. So we call this accurate our answer. So we call this accurate our answer. So we call this distance h. So the x1 equals x + h. And distance h. So the x1 equals x + h. And distance h. So the x1 equals x + h. And thus this value is f of x + h. Now the thus this value is f of x + h. Now the thus this value is f of x + h. Now the change in y over the change in x is fx change in y over the change in x is fx change in y over the change in x is fx plus h minus f ofx all over h. Then we plus h minus f ofx all over h. Then we plus h minus f ofx all over h. Then we stick this thing on the end which just stick this thing on the end which just stick this thing on the end which just means h approaches zero and our answer means h approaches zero and our answer means h approaches zero and our answer is 2x. It turns out that to find the is 2x. It turns out that to find the is 2x. It turns out that to find the derivative of any polomial function you derivative of any polomial function you derivative of any polomial function you just take each term multiply it by the just take each term multiply it by the just take each term multiply it by the power and then subtract one from the power and then subtract one from the power and then subtract one from the power. Two one-sided derivative. If we power. Two one-sided derivative. If we power. Two one-sided derivative. If we have a function like f ofx= x^2 where x have a function like f ofx= x^2 where x have a function like f ofx= x^2 where x is greater than or equal to 0 then is greater than or equal to 0 then is greater than or equal to 0 then what's the derivative of f ofx at x= 0? what's the derivative of f ofx at x= 0? what's the derivative of f ofx at x= 0? Well, if you approach from the right Well, if you approach from the right Well, if you approach from the right hand side, then the derivative is just hand side, then the derivative is just hand side, then the derivative is just zero. But if you approach from the left zero. But if you approach from the left zero. But if you approach from the left hand side, then there's no derivative hand side, then there's no derivative hand side, then there's no derivative because there's no left hand side to because there's no left hand side to because there's no left hand side to approach from. So to define this approach from. So to define this approach from. So to define this derivative, you use the exact same derivative, you use the exact same derivative, you use the exact same formula as before. But just to be petty formula as before. But just to be petty formula as before. But just to be petty and annoying, your math professor will and annoying, your math professor will and annoying, your math professor will remove marks for not including the tiny remove marks for not including the tiny remove marks for not including the tiny little plus, which indicates that you're little plus, which indicates that you're little plus, which indicates that you're approaching from the right hand side. approaching from the right hand side. approaching from the right hand side. Three, higher order derivative. As the Three, higher order derivative. As the Three, higher order derivative. As the name suggests, this is just the name suggests, this is just the name suggests, this is just the classical derivative done multiple classical derivative done multiple classical derivative done multiple times. So if you have y= f ofx, times. So if you have y= f ofx, times. So if you have y= f ofx, differentiate, then differentiate again, differentiate, then differentiate again, differentiate, then differentiate again, then again, and so on. Four, implicit then again, and so on. Four, implicit then again, and so on. Four, implicit derivative. If y = x + 1 ^ 5, then to derivative. If y = x + 1 ^ 5, then to derivative. If y = x + 1 ^ 5, then to find the derivative, you first need to find the derivative, you first need to find the derivative, you first need to set an intermediate variable u equal to set an intermediate variable u equal to set an intermediate variable u equal to the inner function x + 1 and then find the inner function x + 1 and then find the inner function x + 1 and then find the derivative of y with respect to u, the derivative of y with respect to u, the derivative of y with respect to u, which gives us 5 u to 4. Then find the which gives us 5 u to 4. Then find the which gives us 5 u to 4. Then find the derivative of u with respect to x. Then derivative of u with respect to x. Then derivative of u with respect to x. Then multiply them together to get the multiply them together to get the multiply them together to get the derivative of y with respect to x. This derivative of y with respect to x. This derivative of y with respect to x. This is known as the chain rule and it's is known as the chain rule and it's is known as the chain rule and it's often used for implicit differentiation. often used for implicit differentiation. often used for implicit differentiation. For example, if we want to differentiate For example, if we want to differentiate For example, if we want to differentiate the equation for a circle, which is x^2 the equation for a circle, which is x^2 the equation for a circle, which is x^2 + y^2 = 1. Then instead of rearranging + y^2 = 1. Then instead of rearranging + y^2 = 1. Then instead of rearranging the equation, we can just find the the equation, we can just find the the equation, we can just find the derivative of each term with respect to derivative of each term with respect to derivative of each term with respect to x. So we get 2x + 2 y dy by dx. This is x. So we get 2x + 2 y dy by dx. This is x. So we get 2x + 2 y dy by dx. This is using the chain rule where y is treated using the chain rule where y is treated using the chain rule where y is treated as our intermediate variable. And so as our intermediate variable. And so as our intermediate variable. And so once we rearrange this, we get a nice once we rearrange this, we get a nice once we rearrange this, we get a nice equation for our derivative. Five. equation for our derivative. Five. equation for our derivative. Five. Complex derivative. So far we've been Complex derivative. So far we've been Complex derivative. So far we've been dealing with functions that work on real dealing with functions that work on real dealing with functions that work on real numbers. But what about functions that numbers. But what about functions that numbers. But what about functions that work on complex numbers? Imagine a work on complex numbers? Imagine a work on complex numbers? Imagine a two-dimensional input space for zed and two-dimensional input space for zed and two-dimensional input space for zed and a two-dimensional output space for f of a two-dimensional output space for f of a two-dimensional output space for f of zed, both complex numbers. Instead of zed, both complex numbers. Instead of zed, both complex numbers. Instead of asking how does a small change in x asking how does a small change in x asking how does a small change in x affect y, we're asking how does a small affect y, we're asking how does a small affect y, we're asking how does a small change in zed in the complex plane change in zed in the complex plane change in zed in the complex plane affect f of zed in the complex plane. affect f of zed in the complex plane. affect f of zed in the complex plane. Sometimes the change in f of zed is Sometimes the change in f of zed is Sometimes the change in f of zed is proportional to the change in zed. But proportional to the change in zed. But proportional to the change in zed. But when it isn't, we say the function is when it isn't, we say the function is when it isn't, we say the function is non-ifferiable. So there's no complex non-ifferiable. So there's no complex non-ifferiable. So there's no complex derivative. Fun fact, imaginary numbers derivative. Fun fact, imaginary numbers derivative. Fun fact, imaginary numbers were invented by imaginary were invented by imaginary were invented by imaginary mathematicians who had too much mathematicians who had too much mathematicians who had too much imaginary time. Six, partial derivative. imaginary time. Six, partial derivative. imaginary time. Six, partial derivative. This is used to differentiate with This is used to differentiate with This is used to differentiate with respect to a variable whilst keeping all respect to a variable whilst keeping all respect to a variable whilst keeping all other variables constant. It's useful other variables constant. It's useful other variables constant. It's useful for analyzing functions of multiple for analyzing functions of multiple for analyzing functions of multiple variables. For example, in a function f variables. For example, in a function f variables. For example, in a function f ofx, the partial derivative d x by dell ofx, the partial derivative d x by dell ofx, the partial derivative d x by dell x tells us how f changes while x x tells us how f changes while x x tells us how f changes while x changes, but y remains constant. Seven. changes, but y remains constant. Seven. changes, but y remains constant. Seven. Directional derivative. Let's say we Directional derivative. Let's say we Directional derivative. Let's say we have a function f ofxy. So the input have a function f ofxy. So the input have a function f ofxy. So the input space is two-dimensional. Using partial space is two-dimensional. Using partial space is two-dimensional. Using partial derivatives, we can find the gradient of derivatives, we can find the gradient of derivatives, we can find the gradient of this function in the x direction and in this function in the x direction and in this function in the x direction and in the y direction. But what about the u the y direction. But what about the u the y direction. But what about the u direction where u is a direction vector. direction where u is a direction vector. direction where u is a direction vector. For example, let's say u is in the For example, let's say u is in the For example, let's say u is in the direction 1 2. Then to find the direction 1 2. Then to find the direction 1 2. Then to find the directional derivative du of f, we just directional derivative du of f, we just directional derivative du of f, we just take one lot of dell f by d x plus two take one lot of dell f by d x plus two take one lot of dell f by d x plus two lots of d f by d y. 8 covariant lots of d f by d y. 8 covariant lots of d f by d y. 8 covariant derivative. But what about when the derivative. But what about when the derivative. But what about when the input space is curved or warped in some input space is curved or warped in some input space is curved or warped in some way? To account for this, we take the way? To account for this, we take the way? To account for this, we take the covariant derivative, which ensures that covariant derivative, which ensures that covariant derivative, which ensures that we account for both the direction vector we account for both the direction vector we account for both the direction vector and the basis vector which is warping and the basis vector which is warping and the basis vector which is warping our input space. The covariant our input space. The covariant our input space. The covariant derivative applies to vector or tensor derivative applies to vector or tensor derivative applies to vector or tensor fields, not just scalar functions. Nine, fields, not just scalar functions. Nine, fields, not just scalar functions. Nine, lee derivative. Imagine you have a lee derivative. Imagine you have a lee derivative.
