Description:
好的，明白了。这是一个对提供的文本进行总结、提炼核心观点并以中文回复的任务，具体要求如下：

**任务目标：**

1.  **结构化总结：** 对文本内容进行提纲式总结，确保清晰明了。
2.  **核心结论：** 用一句话概括全文的核心观点。
3.  **框架分析：** 提取文本内容所呈现的总体框架。
4.  **概念图：** 使用 Mermaid 语法创建一个概念图，逻辑清晰地连接所有关键要素，注重美观和信息的有效传递，mermaid代码嵌入到指定的代码块内。

**执行回复：**

以下是根据您提供的文本生成的总结：

**一、 总结**

*   **对Gemini 2.5 Pro的重新评估：**
    *   最初认为 Gemini 2.5 Pro 在编码方面表现不佳，但经过进一步测试后，发现其能力非常出色。
    *   现在 Gemini 2.5 Pro 是作者日常使用的两个模型之一。
*   **定价与使用限制的改变：**
    *   最初 Gemini 2.5 Pro 受到免费使用额度的限制，使得大型项目的编码变得困难。
    *   现在可以付费获得无限制的使用权限，但定价方式较为复杂。
*   **定价的复杂性与实际费用：**
    *   Gemini 2.5 Pro 的定价基于 tokens 数量，理论上比 Claude 3.7 Sonnet 更便宜。
    *   但由于 Gemini 2.5 Pro 拥有更大的上下文窗口（token context windows），可能导致更高的输入 tokens 费用，最终费用可能更高。
*   **降低成本的策略：**
    *   经常开启新的聊天窗口可以有效降低 tokens 使用量，从而降低成本。
    *   结合 Cursor 或 Windsurf 等工具（如果按请求收费而非按 token 收费），可以提高效率和降低成本。
*   **Gemini 2.5 Pro的优势与劣势：**
    *   Gemini 2.5 Pro 擅长分析大型代码库和进行大规模更改，例如向大型项目添加新功能。
    *   在设计美观的界面方面仍然存在不足。
*   **实际应用案例：**
    *   作者使用 Gemini 2.5 Pro 构建了一个具有动态定价和自动更新功能的销售页面。
    *   Gemini 2.5 Pro 还被用于创建自动展示用户评论的功能，解决了评论重叠的问题。
*   **工作流程建议：**
    *   建议先使用 Claude 3.7 Sonnet 进行设计和布局。
    *   然后使用 Gemini 2.5 Pro 进行实际的开发工作。
    *   根据任务的不同，在两个模型之间切换。

**二、核心观点**

虽然Gemini 2.5 Pro在编码方面表现出色，但在使用时需要注意定价策略，并通过开启新的聊天窗口来降低成本，并与擅长设计的模型（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet）结合使用，以达到最佳效果。

**三、总体框架**

1.  **观点转变：** 从最初的否定到后来的肯定。
2.  **定价分析：** 解释 Gemini 2.5 Pro 的定价策略及其潜在问题。
3.  **成本优化：** 提供降低 Gemini 2.5 Pro 使用成本的实用建议。
4.  **能力对比：** 对比 Gemini 2.5 Pro 和 Claude 3.7 Sonnet 的优劣势。
5.  **工作流建议：** 结合实际案例，给出使用两种模型的最佳实践。

**四、概念图**

But after spending another week coding. But after spending another week coding. But after spending another week really testing it and putting it through really testing it and putting it through really testing it and putting it through its paces, and I'll show you exactly its paces, and I'll show you exactly its paces, and I'll show you exactly what I built with it in this video, I what I built with it in this video, I what I built with it in this video, I have to admit that I was wrong. Pretty have to admit that I was wrong. Pretty have to admit that I was wrong. Pretty pretty wrong because Gemini 2. 5 Pro is pretty wrong because Gemini 2. 5 Pro is pretty wrong because Gemini 2. 5 Pro is actually incredible. And it is now one actually incredible. And it is now one actually incredible. And it is now one of the two models that I use every of the two models that I use every of the two models that I use every single day. But it is still not perfect. single day. But it is still not perfect. single day. But it is still not perfect. and an update from just a few days ago and an update from just a few days ago and an update from just a few days ago introduced a completely new problem. Yo, introduced a completely new problem. Yo, introduced a completely new problem. Yo, what's up guys? My name is Rob and I've what's up guys? My name is Rob and I've what's up guys? My name is Rob and I've been a coder for over 20 years. But now been a coder for over 20 years. But now been a coder for over 20 years. But now I teach founders build their next I teach founders build their next I teach founders build their next million-dollar ideas with AI and million-dollar ideas with AI and million-dollar ideas with AI and automation. And today I'm going to admit automation. And today I'm going to admit automation. And today I'm going to admit that I was wrong and I'm going to show that I was wrong and I'm going to show that I was wrong and I'm going to show you how. So in my comparison between the you how. So in my comparison between the you how. So in my comparison between the two, Gemini 2. 5 Pro and Claudson 3. 7, I two, Gemini 2. 5 Pro and Claudson 3. 7, I two, Gemini 2. 5 Pro and Claudson 3. 7, I let the AIs battle it out in a dystopian let the AIs battle it out in a dystopian let the AIs battle it out in a dystopian AI website competition. And in it, AI website competition. And in it, AI website competition. And in it, Claude absolutely crushed it while Claude absolutely crushed it while Claude absolutely crushed it while Gemini kept running in circles. But Gemini kept running in circles. But Gemini kept running in circles. But here's the thing. Without knowing it, here's the thing. Without knowing it, here's the thing. Without knowing it, then I was trying to make Gemini do then I was trying to make Gemini do then I was trying to make Gemini do something that it's just not good at. something that it's just not good at. something that it's just not good at. And after a full week of additional And after a full week of additional And after a full week of additional testing, I learned why. But before we testing, I learned why. But before we testing, I learned why. But before we get into that, there's something massive get into that, there's something massive get into that, there's something massive that has just changed. because until that has just changed. because until that has just changed. because until literally just a few days ago, you literally just a few days ago, you literally just a few days ago, you couldn't actually pay to use Gemini 2. 5 couldn't actually pay to use Gemini 2. 5 couldn't actually pay to use Gemini 2. 5 Pro, which meant that you were stuck Pro, which meant that you were stuck Pro, which meant that you were stuck with Google's free usage allowances. And with Google's free usage allowances. And with Google's free usage allowances. And if you were coding anything bigger than, if you were coding anything bigger than, if you were coding anything bigger than, you know, just a couple of tests, which you know, just a couple of tests, which you know, just a couple of tests, which I definitely did, then you would hit I definitely did, then you would hit I definitely did, then you would hit these limits very fast. And I did. I had these limits very fast. And I did. I had these limits very fast. And I did. I had to like circle through like several to like circle through like several to like circle through like several private and business accounts to get private and business accounts to get private and business accounts to get like higher limits to actually use like higher limits to actually use like higher limits to actually use Gemini. But this has now changed. So you Gemini. But this has now changed. So you Gemini. But this has now changed. So you can now pay for unlimited usage. And can now pay for unlimited usage. And can now pay for unlimited usage. And this is where things get kind of weird. this is where things get kind of weird. this is where things get kind of weird. So let me show you the actual pricing So let me show you the actual pricing So let me show you the actual pricing because it is really important to because it is really important to because it is really important to understand that the pricing on paper understand that the pricing on paper understand that the pricing on paper might not actually be the pricing that might not actually be the pricing that might not actually be the pricing that you end up paying. So I'll explain to you end up paying. So I'll explain to you end up paying. So I'll explain to you what tokens means in just a second, you what tokens means in just a second, you what tokens means in just a second, but just for the comparison sake, look but just for the comparison sake, look but just for the comparison sake, look at this. So the claw 3. 7 set model at this. So the claw 3. 7 set model at this. So the claw 3. 7 set model charges $3 per input and $15 per output. charges $3 per input and $15 per output. charges $3 per input and $15 per output. The Gemini 2. 5 Pro model has two pricing The Gemini 2. 5 Pro model has two pricing The Gemini 2. 5 Pro model has two pricing tiers. Based on the number of tokens tiers. Based on the number of tokens tiers. Based on the number of tokens that you require, and I'll I'll explain that you require, and I'll I'll explain that you require, and I'll I'll explain that in a second, but in comparison, if that in a second, but in comparison, if that in a second, but in comparison, if you stay under 200, 000 tokens, it would you stay under 200, 000 tokens, it would you stay under 200, 000 tokens, it would be 125 instead of three per input and 10 be 125 instead of three per input and 10 be 125 instead of three per input and 10 per output, which would mean it's less per output, which would mean it's less per output, which would mean it's less than half the price that Claon 3. 7 than half the price that Claon 3. 7 than half the price that Claon 3. 7 charges for the input and about a third charges for the input and about a third charges for the input and about a third less for the output. And even if you go less for the output. And even if you go less for the output. And even if you go over 200, 000 tokens, it is still a bit over 200, 000 tokens, it is still a bit over 200, 000 tokens, it is still a bit cheaper. $250 versus $3 for the input cheaper. $250 versus $3 for the input cheaper. $250 versus $3 for the input and $15 for the output would be the same and $15 for the output would be the same and $15 for the output would be the same as Sonet 3. 7. And here's what the tokens as Sonet 3. 7. And here's what the tokens as Sonet 3. 7. And here's what the tokens really mean, right? So everything you really mean, right? So everything you really mean, right? So everything you ask it and critically important, ask it and critically important, ask it and critically important, everything that you ask it to remember everything that you ask it to remember everything that you ask it to remember throughout a conversation is the input throughout a conversation is the input throughout a conversation is the input tokens and the output tokens, it's its tokens and the output tokens, it's its tokens and the output tokens, it's its answers. So that includes everything you answers. So that includes everything you answers. So that includes everything you know that it instructs you to do or all know that it instructs you to do or all know that it instructs you to do or all the code that it generates. So for the code that it generates. So for the code that it generates. So for inputs and outputs under 200, 000 it inputs and outputs under 200, 000 it inputs and outputs under 200, 000 it would charge you the lower tier and for would charge you the lower tier and for would charge you the lower tier and for everything above 200, 000 it would charge everything above 200, 000 it would charge everything above 200, 000 it would charge you the higher tier. But here's the you the higher tier. But here's the you the higher tier. But here's the thing. Either way, you should save money thing. Either way, you should save money thing. Either way, you should save money with Gemini 2. 5 Pro because even if you with Gemini 2. 5 Pro because even if you with Gemini 2. 5 Pro because even if you use more than 200, 000 tokens, the use more than 200, 000 tokens, the use more than 200, 000 tokens, the maximum price that you were supposed to maximum price that you were supposed to maximum price that you were supposed to pay is 250 and 15, which is still pay is 250 and 15, which is still pay is 250 and 15, which is still slightly cheaper than three and 15. But slightly cheaper than three and 15. But slightly cheaper than three and 15. But unfortunately, this is not true. And unfortunately, this is not true. And unfortunately, this is not true. And this guy on the chat GBT coding Reddit this guy on the chat GBT coding Reddit this guy on the chat GBT coding Reddit had to learn that the hard way because had to learn that the hard way because had to learn that the hard way because he was charged over he was charged over he was charged over $500 for one day of coding. And this $500 for one day of coding. And this $500 for one day of coding. And this actually makes sense because there's a actually makes sense because there's a actually makes sense because there's a huge difference between Sonet 3. 7 and huge difference between Sonet 3. 7 and huge difference between Sonet 3. 7 and Gemini 2. 5 Pro. And that again comes Gemini 2. 5 Pro. And that again comes Gemini 2. 5 Pro. And that again comes down to the token context windows. down to the token context windows. down to the token context windows. Gemini 2. 5 Pro has four times the amount Gemini 2. 5 Pro has four times the amount Gemini 2. 5 Pro has four times the amount of memory that Sonnet 3. 7 has. And of memory that Sonnet 3. 7 has. And of memory that Sonnet 3. 7 has. And unfortunately that means that it can unfortunately that means that it can unfortunately that means that it can lead to way higher input tokens which lead to way higher input tokens which lead to way higher input tokens which you are charged for, right? And that you are charged for, right? And that you are charged for, right? And that means you will pay more even though the means you will pay more even though the means you will pay more even though the model itself would charge less. So even model itself would charge less. So even model itself would charge less. So even though on paper a Gemini 2. 5 Pro is though on paper a Gemini 2. 5 Pro is though on paper a Gemini 2. 5 Pro is supposed to be cheaper, because of the supposed to be cheaper, because of the supposed to be cheaper, because of the context that you require and can use, context that you require and can use, context that you require and can use, you don't have to but can use the you don't have to but can use the you don't have to but can use the prompts get so much more prompts get so much more prompts get so much more expensive that you will end up paying expensive that you will end up paying expensive that you will end up paying more to get similar results. But there more to get similar results. But there more to get similar results. But there is a thing that you can do to change is a thing that you can do to change is a thing that you can do to change that and that is open new chats often. that and that is open new chats often. that and that is open new chats often. Because whenever you open a new chat, it Because whenever you open a new chat, it Because whenever you open a new chat, it erases the memory and you start from erases the memory and you start from erases the memory and you start from scratch. And that means that your model scratch. And that means that your model scratch. And that means that your model is not only cheaper, but even if you use is not only cheaper, but even if you use is not only cheaper, but even if you use something like cursor or windsurf, which something like cursor or windsurf, which something like cursor or windsurf, which is a subscription, right? And you don't is a subscription, right? And you don't is a subscription, right? And you don't really pay per per use of tokens, but really pay per per use of tokens, but really pay per per use of tokens, but more like per request, it makes the more like per request, it makes the more like per request, it makes the result of the models faster, more result of the models faster, more result of the models faster, more reliable, and it doesn't get confused reliable, and it doesn't get confused reliable, and it doesn't get confused that much. So the best practice is to that much. So the best practice is to that much. So the best practice is to open new chats often. And if you do open new chats often. And if you do open new chats often. And if you do that, you should still save money even that, you should still save money even that, you should still save money even if you use Gemini 2. 5 Pro. And this is if you use Gemini 2. 5 Pro. And this is if you use Gemini 2. 5 Pro. And this is even more applicable if you use even more applicable if you use even more applicable if you use something like Klein or RU code because something like Klein or RU code because something like Klein or RU code because then you pay per token. And that means then you pay per token. And that means then you pay per token. And that means that if you just have one chat with like that if you just have one chat with like that if you just have one chat with like lots of context or memory, you will end lots of context or memory, you will end lots of context or memory, you will end up like this guy paying hundreds of up like this guy paying hundreds of up like this guy paying hundreds of dollars per day. But with that out of dollars per day. But with that out of dollars per day. But with that out of the way, let's look at what Gemini is the way, let's look at what Gemini is the way, let's look at what Gemini is actually great at. because I have actually great at. because I have actually great at. because I have discovered that it is really good at discovered that it is really good at discovered that it is really good at analyzing large code bases and making analyzing large code bases and making analyzing large code bases and making big changes like adding new features to big changes like adding new features to big changes like adding new features to big projects. So let me show you a quick big projects. So let me show you a quick big projects. So let me show you a quick example. So I have recently launched a example. So I have recently launched a example. So I have recently launched a product. This video is not about this. product. This video is not about this. product. This video is not about this. It's just something that I'm very proud It's just something that I'm very proud It's just something that I'm very proud of and something that I've built of and something that I've built of and something that I've built exclusively almost exclusively with exclusively almost exclusively with exclusively almost exclusively with Gemini 2. 5 Pro. Right? So this is a Gemini 2. 5 Pro. Right? So this is a Gemini 2. 5 Pro. Right? So this is a sales page. Starting at the top, this sales page. Starting at the top, this sales page. Starting at the top, this page has dynamic pricing which means page has dynamic pricing which means page has dynamic pricing which means that every few sales the price goes up. that every few sales the price goes up. that every few sales the price goes up. It helps me understand how much to It helps me understand how much to It helps me understand how much to actually price this product because I actually price this product because I actually price this product because I didn't know what to price it for, right? didn't know what to price it for, right? didn't know what to price it for, right? And you can see it has like say $50 17% And you can see it has like say $50 17% And you can see it has like say $50 17% early bird pricing increases to this early bird pricing increases to this early bird pricing increases to this price and 24 sales. This is not some price and 24 sales. This is not some price and 24 sales. This is not some like madeup stuff. This is actual logic like madeup stuff. This is actual logic like madeup stuff. This is actual logic that happens in the back end where I that happens in the back end where I that happens in the back end where I track the sales and then say, okay, how track the sales and then say, okay, how track the sales and then say, okay, how many sales are there in each bracket and many sales are there in each bracket and many sales are there in each bracket and when the price goes up automatically? when the price goes up automatically? when the price goes up automatically? All of this stuff, right? which was All of this stuff, right? which was All of this stuff, right? which was really fun to build with Gemini. And really fun to build with Gemini. And really fun to build with Gemini. And then when we scroll down, you see there then when we scroll down, you see there then when we scroll down, you see there are some like pricing tables and the are some like pricing tables and the are some like pricing tables and the design, just to get this out of the way, design, just to get this out of the way, design, just to get this out of the way, all the design I always did with Sonnet all the design I always did with Sonnet all the design I always did with Sonnet 3. 7 and I'll get there in a minute, but 3. 7 and I'll get there in a minute, but 3. 7 and I'll get there in a minute, but all the logic is done by Gemini. So all the logic is done by Gemini. So all the logic is done by Gemini. So here, for example, you can like see that here, for example, you can like see that here, for example, you can like see that there were like previous pricing tiers, there were like previous pricing tiers, there were like previous pricing tiers, right? So there was like 97, 147, 197. right? So there was like 97, 147, 197. right? So there was like 97, 147, 197. And this whole logic of like them being And this whole logic of like them being And this whole logic of like them being sold out or again here it shows like 24 sold out or again here it shows like 24 sold out or again here it shows like 24 spots left, 17% off, right? Here's like spots left, 17% off, right? Here's like spots left, 17% off, right? Here's like the full price. This also, it looks like the full price. This also, it looks like the full price. This also, it looks like this is a static text. It's not like this is a static text. It's not like this is a static text. It's not like this. This this number $50. It changed this. This this number $50. It changed this. This this number $50. It changed with every bracket. And then another with every bracket. And then another with every bracket. And then another really powerful feature is this. So, really powerful feature is this. So, really powerful feature is this. So, this is a brand new product. I don't this is a brand new product. I don't this is a brand new product. I don't have any testimonials yet, right? So, I have any testimonials yet, right? So, I have any testimonials yet, right? So, I wanted to take some of the really nice wanted to take some of the really nice wanted to take some of the really nice YouTube comments that some of you leave YouTube comments that some of you leave YouTube comments that some of you leave under these videos and put them there to under these videos and put them there to under these videos and put them there to like build some trust, right? And the like build some trust, right? And the like build some trust, right? And the problem was that I had this vision of problem was that I had this vision of problem was that I had this vision of like having them like pop up like like like having them like pop up like like like having them like pop up like like raindrops on a lake or something like raindrops on a lake or something like raindrops on a lake or something like reversed raindrops on a lake if that reversed raindrops on a lake if that reversed raindrops on a lake if that makes sense. That's that's how I tried makes sense. That's that's how I tried makes sense. That's that's how I tried to explain it to the AI, right? And the to explain it to the AI, right? And the to explain it to the AI, right? And the problem with that was that they would problem with that was that they would problem with that was that they would overlap because they all have like overlap because they all have like overlap because they all have like different sizing, you know, multiple different sizing, you know, multiple different sizing, you know, multiple lines of text, longer lines of text, and lines of text, longer lines of text, and lines of text, longer lines of text, and I needed to find out a way to display I needed to find out a way to display I needed to find out a way to display them to let them like pop up without them to let them like pop up without them to let them like pop up without them actually overlapping because then them actually overlapping because then them actually overlapping because then people wouldn't be able to read it. So people wouldn't be able to read it. So people wouldn't be able to read it. So Gemini went deep and started cooking Gemini went deep and started cooking Gemini went deep and started cooking really hard, right? They it it was like really hard, right? They it it was like really hard, right? They it it was like way over complicating things, but it was way over complicating things, but it was way over complicating things, but it was really interesting to watch because it really interesting to watch because it really interesting to watch because it would propose different like different would propose different like different would propose different like different ways to see available spacing to make it ways to see available spacing to make it ways to see available spacing to make it more likely that things wouldn't like more likely that things wouldn't like more likely that things wouldn't like pop up. And what it took me an hour and pop up. And what it took me an hour and pop up. And what it took me an hour and a half to make this feature and in the a half to make this feature and in the a half to make this feature and in the end it came up with like a quadrant end it came up with like a quadrant end it came up with like a quadrant system which then I adjusted from there system which then I adjusted from there system which then I adjusted from there because that was the most reliable. But because that was the most reliable. But because that was the most reliable. But the point is, not only did it make it the point is, not only did it make it the point is, not only did it make it work, but it made it work on every work, but it made it work on every work, but it made it work on every resolution. So this is like desktop, resolution. So this is like desktop, resolution. So this is like desktop, right? But you can make it smaller and right? But you can make it smaller and right? But you can make it smaller and it will still not overlap. So it's a it will still not overlap. So it's a it will still not overlap. So it's a fully responsive feature, right? And you fully responsive feature, right? And you fully responsive feature, right? And you can even like even on a phone, you can can even like even on a phone, you can can even like even on a phone, you can still see it. It works. So this was still see it. It works. So this was still see it. It works. So this was really impressive and Gemini did that. really impressive and Gemini did that. really impressive and Gemini did that. But again, Gemini is not yet perfect. It But again, Gemini is not yet perfect. It But again, Gemini is not yet perfect. It still struggles to create beautiful still struggles to create beautiful still struggles to create beautiful things. So for me having for example things. So for me having for example things. So for me having for example this hero section up here that the video this hero section up here that the video this hero section up here that the video would be a bit further out and you know would be a bit further out and you know would be a bit further out and you know have everything like designed and have everything like designed and have everything like designed and whatever I had to resort to set because whatever I had to resort to set because whatever I had to resort to set because Gemini wow Gemini is so bad at making Gemini wow Gemini is so bad at making Gemini wow Gemini is so bad at making anything look good is wild. So Claude anything look good is wild. So Claude anything look good is wild. So Claude still is the uncontested king when it still is the uncontested king when it still is the uncontested king when it comes to designing things. All of what comes to designing things. All of what comes to designing things. All of what you see here, right, I did with Sonnet you see here, right, I did with Sonnet you see here, right, I did with Sonnet and then the underlying logic was Gemini and then the underlying logic was Gemini and then the underlying logic was Gemini because the reality is that we right now because the reality is that we right now because the reality is that we right now need both of these models. They need both of these models. They need both of these models. They complement each other perfectly and the complement each other perfectly and the complement each other perfectly and the competition and that's something that competition and that's something that competition and that's something that I'm really looking forward for uh I'm really looking forward for uh I'm really looking forward for uh forward to is the competition between forward to is the competition between forward to is the competition between these two will hopefully drive prices these two will hopefully drive prices these two will hopefully drive prices down down down which I would love that because AI which I would love that because AI which I would love that because AI coding is expensive. So my workflow coding is expensive. So my workflow coding is expensive. So my workflow right now is simple. I start my projects right now is simple. I start my projects right now is simple. I start my projects with clot 3. 7 set and I get everything with clot 3. 7 set and I get everything with clot 3. 7 set and I get everything set up and most importantly designed set up and most importantly designed set up and most importantly designed nicely. Then I switch to Gemini 2. 5 Pro nicely. Then I switch to Gemini 2. 5 Pro nicely. Then I switch to Gemini 2. 5 Pro for most of the actual development work. for most of the actual development work. for most of the actual development work. And I often start new chats when a task And I often start new chats when a task And I often start new chats when a task is done because otherwise you will end is done because otherwise you will end is done because otherwise you will end up paying more with Gemini and we don't up paying more with Gemini and we don't up paying more with Gemini and we don't want that, right? And then when I want want that, right? And then when I want want that, right? And then when I want something designed again, like a new something designed again, like a new something designed again, like a new feature or even adjust or modify an feature or even adjust or modify an feature or even adjust or modify an existing design, I switch back to Sonnet existing design, I switch back to Sonnet existing design, I switch back to Sonnet and I'll just go back and forth. If you and I'll just go back and forth. If you and I'll just go back and forth. If you haven't yet, hit subscribe. I post two haven't yet, hit subscribe. I post two haven't yet, hit subscribe. I post two to three videos like this every single to three videos like this every single to three videos like this every single week, helping non- tech founders build week, helping non- tech founders build week, helping non- tech founders build better apps and hire fewer developers to better apps and hire fewer developers to better apps and hire fewer developers to build their next million-doll ideas. So, build their next million-doll ideas. So, build their next million-doll ideas. So, I'll see you in the next one. Peace.
