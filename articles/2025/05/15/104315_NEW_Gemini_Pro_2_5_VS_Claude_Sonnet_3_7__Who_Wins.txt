WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en Google released Gemini 2. 5. I made a Google released Gemini 2. 5. I made a Google released Gemini 2. 5. I made a video about it. And then someone asks, video about it. And then someone asks, video about it. And then someone asks, is it better than Claude? So, in today's is it better than Claude? So, in today's is it better than Claude? So, in today's video, we're going to see. So, on the video, we're going to see. So, on the video, we're going to see. So, on the left hand side here, we have Gemini 2. 5 left hand side here, we have Gemini 2. 5 left hand side here, we have Gemini 2. 5 Pro Experimental. And on the right here, Pro Experimental. And on the right here, Pro Experimental. And on the right here, we have Claude. Now, both of these I'm we have Claude. Now, both of these I'm we have Claude. Now, both of these I'm on the free plan. So, just keep that in on the free plan. So, just keep that in on the free plan. So, just keep that in mind. So, we're going to have a look. mind. So, we're going to have a look. mind. So, we're going to have a look. I've created a game, a landing page, and I've created a game, a landing page, and I've created a game, a landing page, and then I'm going to create a customized then I'm going to create a customized then I'm going to create a customized website after that. And that one we'll website after that. And that one we'll website after that. And that one we'll do live. So the first things first let's do live. So the first things first let's do live. So the first things first let's open up the sidebars and I'll open up open up the sidebars and I'll open up open up the sidebars and I'll open up the pages that we created just so you the pages that we created just so you the pages that we created just so you can actually have a look first at the can actually have a look first at the can actually have a look first at the code and then after that we can go and code and then after that we can go and code and then after that we can go and create our own suppose I want to open up create our own suppose I want to open up create our own suppose I want to open up one at a time. So the first thing we had one at a time. So the first thing we had one at a time. So the first thing we had created was let me open up chat GPT created was let me open up chat GPT created was let me open up chat GPT because obviously asked chat GPT how I because obviously asked chat GPT how I because obviously asked chat GPT how I could best do this. So first thing here could best do this. So first thing here could best do this. So first thing here I asked is build a 3D game with 3JS. So I asked is build a 3D game with 3JS. So I asked is build a 3D game with 3JS. So this is to see essentially the this is to see essentially the this is to see essentially the capabilities it has for creating games capabilities it has for creating games capabilities it has for creating games which you can actually visualize. So which you can actually visualize. So which you can actually visualize. So this here is Gemini's. It's a ball this here is Gemini's. It's a ball this here is Gemini's. It's a ball dropping game where drops balls from the dropping game where drops balls from the dropping game where drops balls from the sky and um you move around. Now the sky and um you move around. Now the sky and um you move around. Now the problem I found with it is I can only problem I found with it is I can only problem I found with it is I can only actually move right and left. I can't actually move right and left. I can't actually move right and left. I can't move move move forward. Generally the graphics look forward. Generally the graphics look forward. Generally the graphics look fine. Doesn't look bad. Has where it is. fine. Doesn't look bad. Has where it is. fine. Doesn't look bad. Has where it is. It's not bad. Although the one problem It's not bad. Although the one problem It's not bad. Although the one problem was to get this to run, I did have to go was to get this to run, I did have to go was to get this to run, I did have to go back and forth a couple of times to get back and forth a couple of times to get back and forth a couple of times to get it to to work. So I had to ask it, but it to to work. So I had to ask it, but it to to work. So I had to ask it, but that probably was my fault cuz I didn't that probably was my fault cuz I didn't that probably was my fault cuz I didn't click canvas originally. On the other click canvas originally. On the other click canvas originally. On the other side here, we have Claude. Now Claude side here, we have Claude. Now Claude side here, we have Claude. Now Claude just automatically started using canvas. just automatically started using canvas. just automatically started using canvas. I didn't have to ask it. But the problem I didn't have to ask it. But the problem I didn't have to ask it. But the problem was there's no preview here for it. I was there's no preview here for it. I was there's no preview here for it. I had to download and then we have to pop had to download and then we have to pop had to download and then we have to pop open here. And then you can see it here. open here. And then you can see it here. open here. And then you can see it here. Now, I think it looks substantially Now, I think it looks substantially Now, I think it looks substantially worse. However, we'll put them side to worse. However, we'll put them side to worse. However, we'll put them side to side. There we go. You can see I think side. There we go. You can see I think side. There we go. You can see I think it looks substantially worse. However, it looks substantially worse. However, it looks substantially worse. However, all the functionalities there. I can all the functionalities there. I can all the functionalities there. I can move forwards, backwards, right, and move forwards, backwards, right, and move forwards, backwards, right, and left as you can see. Um, but yeah, so I left as you can see. Um, but yeah, so I left as you can see. Um, but yeah, so I think on this one, I'd say honestly as think on this one, I'd say honestly as think on this one, I'd say honestly as far as functionality goes, probably far as functionality goes, probably far as functionality goes, probably Claude's better. Um, but Google looks Claude's better. Um, but Google looks Claude's better. Um, but Google looks better. But that's thing Google's all better. But that's thing Google's all better. But that's thing Google's all about branding. I know I suppose Claude about branding. I know I suppose Claude about branding. I know I suppose Claude kind of is too. So on this front, I kind of is too. So on this front, I kind of is too. So on this front, I don't know, personal preference, but don't know, personal preference, but don't know, personal preference, but usability wise, probably Claude wins. usability wise, probably Claude wins. usability wise, probably Claude wins. Now the next one I thought after we've Now the next one I thought after we've Now the next one I thought after we've made the game is let's make a landing made the game is let's make a landing made the game is let's make a landing page. So here we made the landing page page. So here we made the landing page page. So here we made the landing page for Gemini. It was rapid for reference for Gemini. It was rapid for reference for Gemini. It was rapid for reference and we'll show you this when we just did and we'll show you this when we just did and we'll show you this when we just did the live one in a moment. is that the the live one in a moment. is that the the live one in a moment. is that the landing page here for Claude took a few landing page here for Claude took a few landing page here for Claude took a few minutes to come up. Took ages, right, minutes to come up. Took ages, right, minutes to come up. Took ages, right, for the code. So, it was already like for the code. So, it was already like for the code. So, it was already like here and then I pasted the prompt into here and then I pasted the prompt into here and then I pasted the prompt into Gemini and then this Gemini was done Gemini and then this Gemini was done Gemini and then this Gemini was done before this code was finished. Um, so before this code was finished. Um, so before this code was finished. Um, so yeah, much much faster. I think it's yeah, much much faster. I think it's yeah, much much faster. I think it's because the code uses libraries for the because the code uses libraries for the because the code uses libraries for the CSS and stuff. CSS and stuff. CSS and stuff. Um, but I don't know, it's much faster Um, but I don't know, it's much faster Um, but I don't know, it's much faster anyway. And I think the result is 100 anyway. And I think the result is 100 anyway. And I think the result is 100 times better. So let me download this times better. So let me download this times better. So let me download this just so you can see it a bit better just so you can see it a bit better just so you can see it a bit better because it is a single page HTML here. because it is a single page HTML here. because it is a single page HTML here. It does appear to have given it a It does appear to have given it a It does appear to have given it a preview. How do I get rid of this? This preview. How do I get rid of this? This preview. How do I get rid of this? This happens all the time with Chrome. happens all the time with Chrome. happens all the time with Chrome. Honestly, come on Honestly, come on Honestly, come on Google. Can't even get rid of Google. Can't even get rid of Google. Can't even get rid of it. There we go. So it. There we go. So it. There we go. So um let me see. It opens it up here, but um let me see. It opens it up here, but um let me see. It opens it up here, but doesn't doesn't fit the whole screen on doesn't doesn't fit the whole screen on doesn't doesn't fit the whole screen on split screen, which is frustrating. So, split screen, which is frustrating. So, split screen, which is frustrating. So, if we download it and then we pop open if we download it and then we pop open if we download it and then we pop open here, we can see a bit better. Let's do here, we can see a bit better. Let's do here, we can see a bit better. Let's do the same probably with this the same probably with this the same probably with this here. Actually, no, cuz I don't actually here. Actually, no, cuz I don't actually here. Actually, no, cuz I don't actually know how to do that from here. I don't know how to do that from here. I don't know how to do that from here. I don't know how to share the canvas. So, know how to share the canvas. So, know how to share the canvas. So, anyway, I think Gemini looks 100 times anyway, I think Gemini looks 100 times anyway, I think Gemini looks 100 times better. Um, the one on the right, it better. Um, the one on the right, it better. Um, the one on the right, it does look decent, but it's just like does look decent, but it's just like does look decent, but it's just like kind kind kind of super basic. Whereas the one on the of super basic. Whereas the one on the of super basic. Whereas the one on the left I feel like looks like an actual left I feel like looks like an actual left I feel like looks like an actual SAS. And so like here you can click on SAS. And so like here you can click on SAS. And so like here you can click on features goes to here. Then features goes to here. Then features goes to here. Then testimonials. It made up some testimonials. It made up some testimonials. It made up some testimonials which is a bit sus. Um and testimonials which is a bit sus. Um and testimonials which is a bit sus. Um and then pricing. It has this pricing which then pricing. It has this pricing which then pricing. It has this pricing which I think looks really quite cool. And I think looks really quite cool. And I think looks really quite cool. And then get started. And then at the bottom then get started. And then at the bottom then get started. And then at the bottom doesn't have all your stuff whereas it doesn't have all your stuff whereas it doesn't have all your stuff whereas it does here which looks better but I just does here which looks better but I just does here which looks better but I just feel it might even just be the the fonts feel it might even just be the the fonts feel it might even just be the the fonts and stuff but I think this one looks and stuff but I think this one looks and stuff but I think this one looks looks much better. So Gemini for me on looks much better. So Gemini for me on looks much better. So Gemini for me on the landing page front. Now the next one the landing page front. Now the next one the landing page front. Now the next one I want to try here is a customized I want to try here is a customized I want to try here is a customized website. So make a website. So make a website. So make a website for Luke Jburn a landing page for his school Jburn a landing page for his school Jburn a landing page for his school community. Apply the we'll see if it's community. Apply the we'll see if it's community. Apply the we'll see if it's able to find my community and find me able to find my community and find me able to find my community and find me because often it does they don't because often it does they don't because often it does they don't actually find me very well. Um, so let's actually find me very well. Um, so let's actually find me very well. Um, so let's hit the Gemini first and then Claude hit the Gemini first and then Claude hit the Gemini first and then Claude here. We'll see just how fast it is. So here. We'll see just how fast it is. So here. We'll see just how fast it is. So here they're going to have to go and do here they're going to have to go and do here they're going to have to go and do a bit of research. Then they're going to a bit of research. Then they're going to a bit of research. Then they're going to have to build out the website. So have to build out the website. So have to build out the website. So Claude's already starting to build out Claude's already starting to build out Claude's already starting to build out the website. Um, Gemini is still the website. Um, Gemini is still the website. Um, Gemini is still thinking, understanding the goal, target thinking, understanding the goal, target thinking, understanding the goal, target market. market. market. Um, we'll see if it goes and tries to Um, we'll see if it goes and tries to Um, we'll see if it goes and tries to actually find stuff about me. I mean, actually find stuff about me. I mean, actually find stuff about me. I mean, they're still both taking ages they're still both taking ages they're still both taking ages considering it's just a couple hundred considering it's just a couple hundred considering it's just a couple hundred lines of HTML, right? There we go. So, lines of HTML, right? There we go. So, lines of HTML, right? There we go. So, oh right, let's uh download this. Let's open it up. So, on the right this. Let's open it up. So, on the right this. Let's open it up. So, on the right we have Claude. On the left we have we have Claude. On the left we have we have Claude. On the left we have Gemini. So, I think honestly first Gemini. So, I think honestly first Gemini. So, I think honestly first glance again glance again glance again Gemini. I think they Gemini looks better Gemini. I think they Gemini looks better Gemini. I think they Gemini looks better so far. Let's have a look here too. so far. Let's have a look here too. so far. Let's have a look here too. Yeah, I don't know what it is. I think Yeah, I don't know what it is. I think Yeah, I don't know what it is. I think the way Google does it with like these the way Google does it with like these the way Google does it with like these little cards and stuff I think looks little cards and stuff I think looks little cards and stuff I think looks much better. Um is also much better. Um is also much better. Um is also faster. Um or I think roughly the same faster. Um or I think roughly the same faster. Um or I think roughly the same honestly and none of them are using my honestly and none of them are using my honestly and none of them are using my actual data. Um but yeah, I think actual data. Um but yeah, I think actual data. Um but yeah, I think personally Gemini looks better and I personally Gemini looks better and I personally Gemini looks better and I think Gemini as well has the upper hand think Gemini as well has the upper hand think Gemini as well has the upper hand here because a it's shown me it here in here because a it's shown me it here in here because a it's shown me it here in split screen and looks good, right? split screen and looks good, right? split screen and looks good, right? which may not really matter, but also I which may not really matter, but also I which may not really matter, but also I can't share this. I can only publish it. can't share this. I can only publish it. can't share this. I can only publish it. Um, but I'd have to publish it and copy Um, but I'd have to publish it and copy Um, but I'd have to publish it and copy the link. the link. the link. Um, unpublish I have access. So, here I Um, unpublish I have access. So, here I Um, unpublish I have access. So, here I can just click share canvas and then can just click share canvas and then can just click share canvas and then boom. I don't need to do much here. boom. I don't need to do much here. boom. I don't need to do much here. Publish and copy link. And I suppose Publish and copy link. And I suppose Publish and copy link. And I suppose it's the same. I didn't even know Claude it's the same. I didn't even know Claude it's the same. I didn't even know Claude had that to be fair. So, there you go. had that to be fair. So, there you go. had that to be fair. So, there you go. Both of them can do it. So, I think it's Both of them can do it. So, I think it's Both of them can do it. So, I think it's just your style. And I think this looks just your style. And I think this looks just your style. And I think this looks better. Claude looks a bit spammy. Um, better. Claude looks a bit spammy. Um, better. Claude looks a bit spammy. Um, so yeah, so yeah, so yeah, that's in my opinion. Gemini is still that's in my opinion. Gemini is still that's in my opinion. Gemini is still better for coding. Um, you know what? better for coding. Um, you know what? better for coding. Um, you know what? Let's make it another quick game because Let's make it another quick game because Let's make it another quick game because I think game can be good. Let's say make I think game can be good. Let's say make I think game can be good. Let's say make a snake a snake a snake game. Be game. Be game. Be as creative as possible. It's for a as creative as possible. It's for a as creative as possible. It's for a hackathon. Let's copy that. Send that hackathon. Let's copy that. Send that hackathon. Let's copy that. Send that in. We'll do it to Claude, too. We'll in. We'll do it to Claude, too. We'll in. We'll do it to Claude, too. We'll send that in. send that in. send that in. And let's see. So the reason here I'm And let's see. So the reason here I'm And let's see. So the reason here I'm asking this because Snake super simple asking this because Snake super simple asking this because Snake super simple game. You make it in like your first game. You make it in like your first game. You make it in like your first term at at university for computer term at at university for computer term at at university for computer science. But I'm saying be as creative science. But I'm saying be as creative science. But I'm saying be as creative as possible because I'm kind of testing as possible because I'm kind of testing as possible because I'm kind of testing the model to think what does the model the model to think what does the model the model to think what does the model think's creative and um how how well is think's creative and um how how well is think's creative and um how how well is able to pull it off. So we'll see. able to pull it off. So we'll see. able to pull it off. So we'll see. Again, Claude just boom straight into Again, Claude just boom straight into Again, Claude just boom straight into it. Didn't really do any thinking from it. Didn't really do any thinking from it. Didn't really do any thinking from what I can see. other uh Gemini on the what I can see. other uh Gemini on the what I can see. other uh Gemini on the other hand had done a bit of thinking other hand had done a bit of thinking other hand had done a bit of thinking before it starts coding. Um but let's before it starts coding. Um but let's before it starts coding. Um but let's see how fast they are. At first glance, see how fast they are. At first glance, see how fast they are. At first glance, Gemini looks to be like 10 times Gemini looks to be like 10 times Gemini looks to be like 10 times faster. So they're both still going. And faster. So they're both still going. And faster. So they're both still going. And that's uh Claude just moving on to the that's uh Claude just moving on to the that's uh Claude just moving on to the body. Yeah. Whereas there you go. Gemini body. Yeah. Whereas there you go. Gemini body. Yeah. Whereas there you go. Gemini finished, I think. Yeah. There you go. finished, I think. Yeah. There you go. finished, I think. Yeah. There you go. Oh, Cybers Snake. That looks pretty Oh, Cybers Snake. That looks pretty Oh, Cybers Snake. That looks pretty cool, doesn't it? Whereas Yeah, Claude's cool, doesn't it? Whereas Yeah, Claude's cool, doesn't it? Whereas Yeah, Claude's still going at it. So, let's have a look still going at it. So, let's have a look still going at it. So, let's have a look at Cyber Snake. Does it at Cyber Snake. Does it at Cyber Snake. Does it work? Why is nothing working? Why is it not working? Why is it not working? Why is it not working? So, it's not working when I working? So, it's not working when I working? So, it's not working when I click click click anything. That's not very handy. Let me anything. That's not very handy. Let me anything. That's not very handy. Let me see it see it see it again. Yeah, once I click start, it just again. Yeah, once I click start, it just again. Yeah, once I click start, it just freezes. freezes. freezes. Maybe maybe it's the browser. It's Maybe maybe it's the browser. It's Maybe maybe it's the browser. It's trying to probably use too trying to probably use too trying to probably use too much too much of my my much too much of my my much too much of my my browsing browsing browsing RAM. I don't know. But I'm pressing all RAM. I don't know. But I'm pressing all RAM. I don't know. But I'm pressing all the buttons and nothing's happening. So, the buttons and nothing's happening. So, the buttons and nothing's happening. So, I mean, it looks cool. It looks like it I mean, it looks cool. It looks like it I mean, it looks cool. It looks like it could be good. CL is still going on. could be good. CL is still going on. could be good. CL is still going on. This is crazy. I suppose that's a good This is crazy. I suppose that's a good This is crazy. I suppose that's a good time to to plug my school community. So time to to plug my school community. So time to to plug my school community. So basically I get tired of trying to make basically I get tired of trying to make basically I get tired of trying to make stuff using AI and uh having to just stuff using AI and uh having to just stuff using AI and uh having to just like trace through the internet. You like trace through the internet. You like trace through the internet. You finding stuff that's too technical, not finding stuff that's too technical, not finding stuff that's too technical, not technical enough, etc. Um and so I technical enough, etc. Um and so I technical enough, etc. Um and so I created Applied AI which is a community created Applied AI which is a community created Applied AI which is a community for you to build, automate and stay for you to build, automate and stay for you to build, automate and stay ahead. So basically ride this AI hype ahead. So basically ride this AI hype ahead. So basically ride this AI hype train and wave and ensure that you're on train and wave and ensure that you're on train and wave and ensure that you're on it and don't get left behind. So we have it and don't get left behind. So we have it and don't get left behind. So we have calls every week with me where you can calls every week with me where you can calls every week with me where you can come along, ask me questions, have come along, ask me questions, have come along, ask me questions, have classrooms where he can teach you classrooms where he can teach you classrooms where he can teach you everything from the bottom up from AI everything from the bottom up from AI everything from the bottom up from AI foundations, technical foundations, foundations, technical foundations, foundations, technical foundations, building the solutions, what tools to building the solutions, what tools to building the solutions, what tools to use, how to make AI clones, etc. Coding use, how to make AI clones, etc. Coding use, how to make AI clones, etc. Coding AI, all that good stuff. Um, and then as AI, all that good stuff. Um, and then as AI, all that good stuff. Um, and then as well as a community of people who are well as a community of people who are well as a community of people who are all learning AI and helping one another all learning AI and helping one another all learning AI and helping one another build build products and projects. So build build products and projects. So build build products and projects. So come along, join up, join up. We are come along, join up, join up. We are come along, join up, join up. We are currently transforming it into this currently transforming it into this currently transforming it into this because it used to be slightly because it used to be slightly because it used to be slightly different. So, we have a introductory different. So, we have a introductory different. So, we have a introductory rate. Come along, join in 7-day free rate. Come along, join in 7-day free rate. Come along, join in 7-day free trial. See if you like it. If you don't, trial. See if you like it. If you don't, trial. See if you like it. If you don't, tell me why. Give me a message. That's tell me why. Give me a message. That's tell me why. Give me a message. That's not what that message is. But yeah, not what that message is. But yeah, not what that message is.
