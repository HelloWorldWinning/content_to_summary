Description:
好的，以下是根据您提供的文本生成的摘要：

**核心观点：** Claude 3.7 在编程能力上表现出色，尤其是在前端开发方面，但并非完美，且成本较高，暗示未来程序员可能需要适应与AI协同工作的新模式。

**总体框架：**

1.  **引言：**
    *   Anthropic 发布了 Claude 3.7，引起程序员的广泛关注。
    *   对 Claude 3.7 进行了初步测试，认为其性能卓越。

2.  **Claude 3.7 的优势：**
    *   在软件工程基准测试中表现出色，能解决大量 GitHub 问题。
    *   推出了 Claude Code CLI 工具，用于构建、测试和执行代码。
    *   在前端开发方面表现出色，能够构建复杂的 UI 界面。

3.  **Claude 3.7 的局限性：**
    *   成本较高，使用 API 的费用昂贵。
    *   在某些情况下，生成的代码存在问题，例如未使用指定的 Typescript 或 Tailwind。
    *   在解决复杂的加密问题时仍然失败。
    *   可能存在抄袭其他项目的logo的嫌疑。

4.  **Convex 数据库的介绍：**
    *   Convex 是一个开源的反应式数据库，与 AI 模型（如 Claude）配合良好。
    *   Convex 提供类型安全的查询、计划任务、服务器功能和实时数据同步等功能。

5.  **结论：**
    *   Claude 3.7 在编程领域具有潜力，但仍需不断改进。
    *   程序员需要适应与 AI 协同工作的新模式。

that I have CLA installed I can run the in command which installed I can run the in command which installed I can run the in command which will scan the project and create a will scan the project and create a will scan the project and create a markdown file with some initial context markdown file with some initial context markdown file with some initial context and instructions that's cool but now we and instructions that's cool but now we and instructions that's cool but now we have an open session and one thing you have an open session and one thing you have an open session and one thing you might want to do is see how much money might want to do is see how much money might want to do is see how much money you've lost by prompting so far with the you've lost by prompting so far with the you've lost by prompting so far with the cost command I can see that creating cost command I can see that creating cost command I can see that creating that AIT file cost about 8 cents now the that AIT file cost about 8 cents now the that AIT file cost about 8 cents now the first actual job I gave it was pretty first actual job I gave it was pretty first actual job I gave it was pretty easy and that was to create a random easy and that was to create a random easy and that was to create a random name generator in Dino after you enter a name generator in Dino after you enter a name generator in Dino after you enter a prompt it will figure out what to do and prompt it will figure out what to do and prompt it will figure out what to do and then have you confirm it with a yes or then have you confirm it with a yes or then have you confirm it with a yes or no like in this case here it wants to no like in this case here it wants to no like in this case here it wants to generate a new file it'll go ahead and generate a new file it'll go ahead and generate a new file it'll go ahead and write that file to the file system and write that file to the file system and write that file to the file system and then it also creates a dedicated testing then it also creates a dedicated testing then it also creates a dedicated testing file as well that's important because file as well that's important because file as well that's important because using a strongly typed language along using a strongly typed language along using a strongly typed language along with test driven development are ways with test driven development are ways with test driven development are ways for the AI to validate that the code it for the AI to validate that the code it for the AI to validate that the code it writes is actually valid if that test writes is actually valid if that test writes is actually valid if that test fails it can use the feedback to rewrite fails it can use the feedback to rewrite fails it can use the feedback to rewrite the business logic and continue going the business logic and continue going the business logic and continue going back and forth until it gets it right back and forth until it gets it right back and forth until it gets it right and in this example it wrote what I and in this example it wrote what I and in this example it wrote what I would consider perfect code but now would consider perfect code but now would consider perfect code but now let's do something more challenging and let's do something more challenging and let's do something more challenging and have it build an actual visual front end have it build an actual visual front end have it build an actual visual front end UI but instead of react we'll use spelt UI but instead of react we'll use spelt UI but instead of react we'll use spelt when I generated the config you'll when I generated the config you'll when I generated the config you'll notice that it understands the text notice that it understands the text notice that it understands the text stack is using typescript and tailwind stack is using typescript and tailwind stack is using typescript and tailwind and then I'll prompt it for a moderately and then I'll prompt it for a moderately and then I'll prompt it for a moderately complex front-end UI an application that complex front-end UI an application that complex front-end UI an application that can access my microphone and visualize can access my microphone and visualize can access my microphone and visualize the waveform after this initial prompt I the waveform after this initial prompt I the waveform after this initial prompt I had to confirm like 20 different things had to confirm like 20 different things had to confirm like 20 different things and as you can see it wrote a bunch of and as you can see it wrote a bunch of and as you can see it wrote a bunch of new components to my project it took a new components to my project it took a new components to my project it took a lot longer than just prompting claw in lot longer than just prompting claw in lot longer than just prompting claw in the web UI but the end result was worth the web UI but the end result was worth the web UI but the end result was worth the wait here in the application I can the wait here in the application I can the wait here in the application I can click through a waveform frequency and click through a waveform frequency and click through a waveform frequency and circular graphic that visualizes the circular graphic that visualizes the circular

the end result was easy to fix but the end result was easy to fix but the end result looked like this an embarrassing piece looked like this an embarrassing piece looked like this an embarrassing
