reliability fluctuations may affect the reliability fluctuations may affect the reliability of the projected pattern that's why I of the projected pattern that's why I of the projected pattern that's why I strongly recommend back testing these strongly recommend back testing these strongly recommend back testing these indicators with paper money to evaluate indicators with paper money to evaluate
