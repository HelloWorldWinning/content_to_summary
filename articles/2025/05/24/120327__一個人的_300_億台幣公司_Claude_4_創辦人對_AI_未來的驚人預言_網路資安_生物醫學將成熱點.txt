好的，这是对所提供文本的总结，按照您的要求进行组织。

**Claude 4与AI未来展望：一场加速前行的旅程**

**概要大纲:**

1.  **Claude 4 的亮点与即时影响**
    *   提升的能力与自主性：尤其是 Opus 和 Sonnet 模型。
    *   令人兴奋的应用领域：网络安全（高端编程任务）、生物医学与科学研究（特别是 Opus 的强项）。
    *   模型开发过程的“炼金术”：模型在发布前夕能力会神奇地整合和提升。

2.  **AI发展的整体轨迹与速度**
    *   与“Machines of Loving Grace”概念的契合：将其视为未来几年的产品路线图，涵盖生物学和软件领域。
    *   加速发展的步伐：“相对论速度”的比喻，时间尺度正在压缩（例如，Claude 3.5 在几个月内就感觉过时）。标准（如 MCP）的采纳速度也呈指数级加快。
    *   预训练与后训练的共同进步：Claude 4 体现了这两种方法的叠加效应，未来将继续扩展。

3.  **技术前沿的突破**
    *   模型记忆管理：能够管理自身记忆和处理长时程任务，类似于人类记笔记或使用草稿。
    *   交错推理与工具使用：模型能够创建、使用文件，加载数据，并将推理与行动无缝结合（如处理待办事项列表、应对 API 限速）。
    *   可解释性研究：从 AI 模型中获得的洞见反过来启发了神经科学研究，揭示了系统中普遍存在的自然区分模式。

4.  **对软件工程的颠覆**
    *   AI 代理的崛起：开发者将管理“代理集群”，派遣智能体完成任务。
    *   人类角色的变化：重点在于质量控制和细节把控，以及更高效地管理整个流程。
    *   软件生产经济学的改变：成本急剧下降（可能低至几美分），催生按需、一次性的软件构建模式，对开发者、企业和用户的角色带来根本性疑问。

5.  **安全、能力与“竞速之巅”**
    *   核心理念：安全与能力是并行不悖、相互促进的，而非对立关系。
    *   模型信任度：客户对模型的可预测性和可信赖性有高要求，这与确保模型符合人类意图的长期目标一致。
    *   MPC 的标准化：作为社区工具，加速了代理间互操作协议的发展，体现了“竞速之巅”的方法论。

6.  **对构建者的建议**
    *   拥有雄心壮志：构建那些当前模型“几乎不可能”实现的项目。
    *   “推测性执行”：针对即将到来的模型进行开发，即使当前遇到困难，构建基础设施的过程本身也很有价值，当新模型出现时，项目就能迅速落地。

7.  **未来展望（1年 vs 5年）**
    *   未来一年：聚焦代码领域的巨大进展，走向更成熟的智能体集群。
    *   未来五年：看好生物医学领域的潜力，希望 AI 能帮助攻克现有疾病。

**核心观点:**

AI 正以惊人的速度指数级发展，特别是像 Claude 4 这样的模型，通过提升能力和自主性、促进技术创新，正在深刻改变软件开发的模式和经济学，并有望在生物医学等领域带来突破性进展，要求所有参与者以雄心和前瞻性拥抱这一加速前行的旅程。

**总体框架:**

AI 的**加速指数级发展**（通过“相对论速度”比喻强调）是驱动力，它使得模型在**技术能力和自主性**上不断突破（以 Claude 4 为例），这与**安全与能力并行不悖的“竞速之巅”**理念相结合，共同导致了对**软件工程**等领域的颠覆性影响（智能体、成本下降），并为**生物医学**等更广阔的领域带来了未来的潜力；在此背景下，对**构建者**的建议是保持雄心并针对未来的快速迭代进行“推测性开发”。

Um, what Cloud Opus 4 are available. Um, what Cloud Opus 4 are available. Um, what excites you the most about the Cloud 4 excites you the most about the Cloud 4 excites you the most about the Cloud 4 models and how does it change your models and how does it change your models and how does it change your thinking about what's possible in the thinking about what's possible in the thinking about what's possible in the next 12 months? Yeah. So, um, I I think next 12 months? Yeah. So, um, I I think next 12 months? Yeah. So, um, I I think abstractly the thing I'm most excited abstractly the thing I'm most excited abstractly the thing I'm most excited about is, you know, every time you have about is, you know, every time you have about is, you know, every time you have a new class of models, there's like more a new class of models, there's like more a new class of models, there's like more you can do with it, right? So, uh, uh, you can do with it, right? So, uh, uh, you can do with it, right? So, uh, uh, you know, we're we're we're going to be you know, we're we're we're going to be you know, we're we're we're going to be releasing uh, models after Claude 4. releasing uh, models after Claude 4. releasing uh, models after Claude 4. There'll probably be a Claude 4. 1 at There'll probably be a Claude 4. 1 at There'll probably be a Claude 4. 1 at some point just like we did with uh, some point just like we did with uh, some point just like we did with uh, with Sonnet uh, uh, 3. 5. And I think with Sonnet uh, uh, 3. 5. And I think with Sonnet uh, uh, 3. 5. And I think we're just at the beginning of of of of we're just at the beginning of of of of we're just at the beginning of of of of of you know what what what we can do of you know what what what we can do of you know what what what we can do with the new the new generation of model with the new the new generation of model with the new the new generation of model in terms of tasks. I think the autonomy in terms of tasks. I think the autonomy in terms of tasks. I think the autonomy is going to go uh uh is going to go much is going to go uh uh is going to go much is going to go uh uh is going to go much further than it has already. Just the further than it has already. Just the further than it has already. Just the ability to give, you know, set your ability to give, you know, set your ability to give, you know, set your model free and and give it the ability model free and and give it the ability model free and and give it the ability to, you know, do something for for a to, you know, do something for for a to, you know, do something for for a long period of time. I think we're I long period of time. I think we're I long period of time. I think we're I think we're very much very much still think we're very much very much still think we're very much very much still still at the beginning of that. Um, uh, still at the beginning of that. Um, uh, still at the beginning of that. Um, uh, I'm I'm actually increasingly excited I'm I'm actually increasingly excited I'm I'm actually increasingly excited about the models for cyber security about the models for cyber security about the models for cyber security tasks. I mean, you can think of cyber tasks. I mean, you can think of cyber tasks. I mean, you can think of cyber security as like a a subset of of of security as like a a subset of of of security as like a a subset of of of coding tasks, but they tend to be coding tasks, but they tend to be coding tasks, but they tend to be higherend coding tasks. And so, I think higherend coding tasks. And so, I think higherend coding tasks. And so, I think we're maybe finally hitting the we're maybe finally hitting the we're maybe finally hitting the threshold for that. And then as a as a threshold for that. And then as a as a threshold for that. And then as a as a former biologist, I'm I'm always excited former biologist, I'm I'm always excited former biologist, I'm I'm always excited about use of the models for uh for you about use of the models for uh for you about use of the models for uh for you know biomedical and kind of kind of kind know biomedical and kind of kind of kind know biomedical and kind of kind of kind of detailed uh scientific research work of detailed uh scientific research work of detailed uh scientific research work which I think opus and opus in which I think opus and opus in which I think opus and opus in particular is going to be good. Opus in particular is going to be good. Opus in particular is going to be good. Opus in particular I think is going to be particular I think is going to be particular I think is going to be particularly particularly strong at particularly particularly strong at particularly particularly strong at that. Um it really connects I think to that. Um it really connects I think to that. Um it really connects I think to machines of loving grace. So how does machines of loving grace. So how does machines of loving grace. So how does cloud 4 fit into that trajectory cloud 4 fit into that trajectory cloud 4 fit into that trajectory overall? I like to joke that people overall? I like to joke that people overall? I like to joke that people think of Machines of Loving Grace as an think of Machines of Loving Grace as an think of Machines of Loving Grace as an essay and I think of it as a product essay and I think of it as a product essay and I think of it as a product road map for the next few years and road map for the next few years and road map for the next few years and curious how Cloud 4 fits into that curious how Cloud 4 fits into that curious how Cloud 4 fits into that journey. Yeah, it was sort of a product journey. Yeah, it was sort of a product journey. Yeah, it was sort of a product road map that I wrote without knowing road map that I wrote without knowing road map that I wrote without knowing how to how to actually get to it and and how to how to actually get to it and and how to how to actually get to it and and kind of said all right guys then this is kind of said all right guys then this is kind of said all right guys then this is your work. This is your job. Um uh yeah your work. This is your job. Um uh yeah your work. This is your job. Um uh yeah uh you know we're I think we're uh you know we're I think we're uh you know we're I think we're increasingly thinking about on the increasingly thinking about on the increasingly thinking about on the biology side of things and and software biology side of things and and software biology side of things and and software is part of that right where and you know is part of that right where and you know is part of that right where and you know increasing amount because biology increasing amount because biology increasing amount because biology increasingly involves data even involved increasingly involves data even involved increasingly involves data even involved data 10 years ago when when I uh when I data 10 years ago when when I uh when I data 10 years ago when when I uh when I was a biologist uh uh I I think I think was a biologist uh uh I I think I think was a biologist uh uh I I think I think I think more and more of it is is is I think more and more of it is is is I think more and more of it is is is going to be okay we have these models going to be okay we have these models going to be okay we have these models that know a lot about biology and they that know a lot about biology and they that know a lot about biology and they can help write code and so if you're a can help write code and so if you're a can help write code and so if you're a computational biologist I think these computational biologist I think these computational biologist I think these models will will really accelerate what models will will really accelerate what models will will really accelerate what what you can do and you know we have a what you can do and you know we have a what you can do and you know we have a number of customers who are who are who number of customers who are who are who number of customers who are who are who are trying out the models for for these are trying out the models for for these are trying out the models for for these tasks. I guess we'll we'll get to that tasks. I guess we'll we'll get to that tasks. I guess we'll we'll get to that in a bit. Yeah, I think uh one of the in a bit. Yeah, I think uh one of the in a bit. Yeah, I think uh one of the first hackathons we did after we uh first hackathons we did after we uh first hackathons we did after we uh released MCP, somebody hooked up MCP to released MCP, somebody hooked up MCP to released MCP, somebody hooked up MCP to one of those like plotters that to do one of those like plotters that to do one of those like plotters that to do drawing and so Cloud could draw for it's drawing and so Cloud could draw for it's drawing and so Cloud could draw for it's actually really fun to like see what actually really fun to like see what actually really fun to like see what Claude draws for itself. But it was like Claude draws for itself. But it was like Claude draws for itself. But it was like the first moment was like MCPS don't the first moment was like MCPS don't the first moment was like MCPS don't just have to be connecting to digital just have to be connecting to digital just have to be connecting to digital systems. They could also be connecting systems. They could also be connecting systems. They could also be connecting to the real world. So like when you'll to the real world. So like when you'll to the real world. So like when you'll be able to drive lab equipment VMCP I be able to drive lab equipment VMCP I be able to drive lab equipment VMCP I think is an interesting uh question for think is an interesting uh question for think is an interesting uh question for soon we'll be able to test Claude by soon we'll be able to test Claude by soon we'll be able to test Claude by connecting it to a polygraph. Yeah, I connecting it to a polygraph. Yeah, I connecting it to a polygraph. Yeah, I love that idea. Are you lying? Who needs interpretability when we have Who needs interpretability when we have Who needs interpretability when we have the polygraph? Um uh you mentioned that moment where you uh you mentioned that moment where you uh you mentioned that moment where you were, you know, convinced that claude were, you know, convinced that claude were, you know, convinced that claude the claude written content was was human the claude written content was was human the claude written content was was human written. Um, any other breakthrough written. Um, any other breakthrough written. Um, any other breakthrough moments in watching us all, you know, moments in watching us all, you know, moments in watching us all, you know, uh, dog food, uh, Cloud 4 or even try it uh, dog food, uh, Cloud 4 or even try it uh, dog food, uh, Cloud 4 or even try it yourself that made you realize this yourself that made you realize this yourself that made you realize this model felt different? Um, you know, I I model felt different? Um, you know, I I model felt different? Um, you know, I I didn't actually understand I didn't didn't actually understand I didn't didn't actually understand I didn't actually understand the details, but actually understand the details, but actually understand the details, but like there were several people in our like there were several people in our like there were several people in our side. There was a moment a few weeks side. There was a moment a few weeks side. There was a moment a few weeks before the model launched where someone before the model launched where someone before the model launched where someone said, "Oh my god, this model just like said, "Oh my god, this model just like said, "Oh my god, this model just like oneshotted this like incredibly oneshotted this like incredibly oneshotted this like incredibly difficult performance engineering task. " difficult performance engineering task. " difficult performance engineering task. " And and no model had ever had ever done And and no model had ever had ever done And and no model had ever had ever done anything like that before. I I I will anything like that before. I I I will anything like that before. I I I will say that there there's there's this say that there there's there's this say that there there's there's this almost almost like superstitious process almost almost like superstitious process almost almost like superstitious process in the model development where like it in the model development where like it in the model development where like it it it it somehow all comes together at it it it somehow all comes together at it it it somehow all comes together at the last moment even if the training pl the last moment even if the training pl the last moment even if the training pl process is all planned out like just process is all planned out like just process is all planned out like just some of the models abilities. Maybe it's some of the models abilities. Maybe it's some of the models abilities. Maybe it's something about their interaction with something about their interaction with something about their interaction with people. Maybe it's something about like people. Maybe it's something about like people. Maybe it's something about like just making it the last bit better just making it the last bit better just making it the last bit better matters. Maybe it's people getting used matters. Maybe it's people getting used matters. Maybe it's people getting used to the model and prompting it. But but to the model and prompting it. But but to the model and prompting it. But but you you always find the the early you you always find the the early you you always find the the early versions of the model um you know people versions of the model um you know people versions of the model um you know people are struggling to figure out how to use are struggling to figure out how to use are struggling to figure out how to use them and then and then you finally get them and then and then you finally get them and then and then you finally get to a point and people are like this to a point and people are like this to a point and people are like this works for me all the time and there's works for me all the time and there's works for me all the time and there's that there's that alchemy that happens that there's that alchemy that happens that there's that alchemy that happens somehow always at the last moment. If somehow always at the last moment. If somehow always at the last moment. If you read uh the Creativity Inc. by Ed you read uh the Creativity Inc. by Ed you read uh the Creativity Inc. by Ed Catmol he talks about the same process Catmol he talks about the same process Catmol he talks about the same process with all the Pixar movies like they're with all the Pixar movies like they're with all the Pixar movies like they're really bad until like 2 days before really bad until like 2 days before really bad until like 2 days before they're supposed to go out. And I feel they're supposed to go out. And I feel they're supposed to go out. And I feel the same way about our model. Not that the same way about our model. Not that the same way about our model. Not that they're really bad, but they're like they're really bad, but they're like they're really bad, but they're like there's like they're not quite there and there's like they're not quite there and there's like they're not quite there and then suddenly they click and we're like then suddenly they click and we're like then suddenly they click and we're like I can't wait to get this out to people. I can't wait to get this out to people. I can't wait to get this out to people. It it doesn't make it doesn't make any It it doesn't make it doesn't make any It it doesn't make it doesn't make any sense because like the training process sense because like the training process sense because like the training process is uniform and you know you know you you is uniform and you know you know you you is uniform and you know you know you you would think that that it doesn't work would think that that it doesn't work would think that that it doesn't work that way that it's all a rational that way that it's all a rational that way that it's all a rational process but it's absolutely not. There's process but it's absolutely not. There's process but it's absolutely not. There's no point on the RL curve very that they no point on the RL curve very that they no point on the RL curve very that they come together it comes together at the come together it comes together at the come together it comes together at the last minute. I don't know why. It's a last minute. I don't know why. It's a last minute. I don't know why. It's a real moment. um many people in the real moment. um many people in the real moment. um many people in the audience are developers here and a audience are developers here and a audience are developers here and a question that I know has come up question that I know has come up question that I know has come up internally as people you know think internally as people you know think internally as people you know think about uh how AI is developing is which about uh how AI is developing is which about uh how AI is developing is which parts of the software engineering job parts of the software engineering job parts of the software engineering job will AI take over um and what becomes will AI take over um and what becomes will AI take over um and what becomes more important in a world where we have more important in a world where we have more important in a world where we have autonomous agents be able to do do a lot autonomous agents be able to do do a lot autonomous agents be able to do do a lot of software engineering yeah um so of software engineering yeah um so of software engineering yeah um so probably like many people here I I read probably like many people here I I read probably like many people here I I read with great interest uh Steve Jo's blog with great interest uh Steve Jo's blog with great interest uh Steve Jo's blog post a couple months ago uh revenge of post a couple months ago uh revenge of post a couple months ago uh revenge of the junior developer uh he had some uh the junior developer uh he had some uh the junior developer uh he had some uh he had some similar blog posts uh he had he had some similar blog posts uh he had he had some similar blog posts uh he had some similar blog post around that. he some similar blog post around that. he some similar blog post around that. he actually uh came in to visit us even um actually uh came in to visit us even um actually uh came in to visit us even um uh um uh uh and and that laid out I uh um uh uh and and that laid out I uh um uh uh and and that laid out I think the vision of where things are think the vision of where things are think the vision of where things are going maybe maybe even better than I going maybe maybe even better than I going maybe maybe even better than I could which is that we're gradually go could which is that we're gradually go could which is that we're gradually go we're gradually going to more and more we're gradually going to more and more we're gradually going to more and more autonomy of the models right we had this autonomy of the models right we had this autonomy of the models right we had this phase where you would do basically phase where you would do basically phase where you would do basically autocomplete now there's this thing that autocomplete now there's this thing that autocomplete now there's this thing that I guess people have called vibe coding I guess people have called vibe coding I guess people have called vibe coding um uh uh uh and and you know then then um uh uh uh and and you know then then um uh uh uh and and you know then then we're going more to kind of like you can we're going more to kind of like you can we're going more to kind of like you can dispatch the agents to to do things and dispatch the agents to to do things and dispatch the agents to to do things and I think with with claude code, we're I think with with claude code, we're I think with with claude code, we're going to go go more in the direction of, going to go go more in the direction of, going to go go more in the direction of, you know, you can dispatch the agents to you know, you can dispatch the agents to you know, you can dispatch the agents to do things. And I'm sure we'll have other do things. And I'm sure we'll have other do things. And I'm sure we'll have other product surfaces that that that allow product surfaces that that that allow product surfaces that that that allow you to do that as well. And I think you to do that as well. And I think you to do that as well. And I think we're we're heading to a world where a we're we're heading to a world where a we're we're heading to a world where a human developer can kind of manage a human developer can kind of manage a human developer can kind of manage a fleet of agents and say, you go off and fleet of agents and say, you go off and fleet of agents and say, you go off and do this, you go off and do this, you go do this, you go off and do this, you go do this, you go off and do this, you go off and do that. But but I think off and do that. But but I think off and do that. But but I think continued human involvement is going to continued human involvement is going to continued human involvement is going to be going to be important for the quality be going to be important for the quality be going to be important for the quality control to make sure they do the right control to make sure they do the right control to make sure they do the right things to get the details right. And so, things to get the details right. And so, things to get the details right. And so, you know, working together on both the you know, working together on both the you know, working together on both the models and the product surface around it models and the product surface around it models and the product surface around it to get the details right is going to be to get the details right is going to be to get the details right is going to be really important. I think it's also really important. I think it's also really important. I think it's also highlighted to me it makes the stuff highlighted to me it makes the stuff highlighted to me it makes the stuff that is inefficient in your work way that is inefficient in your work way that is inefficient in your work way more painful because it's taking you more painful because it's taking you more painful because it's taking you away from like this flow of building. away from like this flow of building. away from like this flow of building. And so, at least it's made me realize And so, at least it's made me realize And so, at least it's made me realize like where we're spending too much time like where we're spending too much time like where we're spending too much time on crossunctional alignment and you on crossunctional alignment and you on crossunctional alignment and you know, road mapping when like we just know, road mapping when like we just know, road mapping when like we just should be trying to get more building. should be trying to get more building. should be trying to get more building. So, it's I've I've it's become more So, it's I've I've it's become more So, it's I've I've it's become more painful as the engineering part has has painful as the engineering part has has painful as the engineering part has has been sped up as well. Um so there's been sped up as well. Um so there's been sped up as well. Um so there's endless debate uh you know around the endless debate uh you know around the endless debate uh you know around the industry around you know uh bigger industry around you know uh bigger industry around you know uh bigger models or smaller architectures which models or smaller architectures which models or smaller architectures which will been in the long run. Um you're will been in the long run. Um you're will been in the long run. Um you're famous for you know popularizing and and famous for you know popularizing and and famous for you know popularizing and and pioneering the scaling laws paper. pioneering the scaling laws paper. pioneering the scaling laws paper. What's your current take on you know the What's your current take on you know the What's your current take on you know the extreme being is pre-training dead? Is extreme being is pre-training dead? Is extreme being is pre-training dead? Is pre-training all that matter still and pre-training all that matter still and pre-training all that matter still and its role you know relative to to its role you know relative to to its role you know relative to to post-training? I mean, without getting post-training? I mean, without getting post-training? I mean, without getting too specific, I would say that, you too specific, I would say that, you too specific, I would say that, you know, the Clawude 4 models embody know, the Clawude 4 models embody know, the Clawude 4 models embody advances in both pre-training and advances in both pre-training and advances in both pre-training and post-training. Um, so we're continuing post-training. Um, so we're continuing post-training. Um, so we're continuing to see the pre-training scaling laws to see the pre-training scaling laws to see the pre-training scaling laws work the way that they've worked before. work the way that they've worked before. work the way that they've worked before. Um, uh, and we're also continuing to see Um, uh, and we're also continuing to see Um, uh, and we're also continuing to see continued advances in uh, post-training continued advances in uh, post-training continued advances in uh, post-training and and they kind of they kind of and and they kind of they kind of and and they kind of they kind of complement each other. Uh, and I I think complement each other. Uh, and I I think complement each other. Uh, and I I think we're going to continue seeing advances we're going to continue seeing advances we're going to continue seeing advances in both of those. I think we're also in both of those. I think we're also in both of those. I think we're also going to continue to scale up. So, we going to continue to scale up. So, we going to continue to scale up. So, we have these these multiple trends, these have these these multiple trends, these have these these multiple trends, these multiple sources of exponential growth, multiple sources of exponential growth, multiple sources of exponential growth, and they're they're all going to and they're they're all going to and they're they're all going to compound with each other, right? That's compound with each other, right? That's compound with each other, right? That's that's why I think all of this is going that's why I think all of this is going that's why I think all of this is going to go very fast. One of the reasons I to go very fast. One of the reasons I to go very fast. One of the reasons I liked Jiega's blog post is that it was liked Jiega's blog post is that it was liked Jiega's blog post is that it was someone who was not me repeating the someone who was not me repeating the someone who was not me repeating the mantra of like it's only going to be a mantra of like it's only going to be a mantra of like it's only going to be a year or two until until these things are year or two until until these things are year or two until until these things are like, you know, are basically peers to like, you know, are basically peers to like, you know, are basically peers to us. It's insane that 37 was just in us. It's insane that 37 was just in us. It's insane that 37 was just in February, right? It's it feels like a February, right? It's it feels like a February, right? It's it feels like a year ago, but it was just three months year ago, but it was just three months year ago, but it was just three months ago. I I I know it. I know. It feels ago. I I I know it. I know. It feels ago. I I I know it. I know. It feels like it's like oh this is this feels like it's like oh this is this feels like it's like oh this is this feels like an obsolete model or something and like an obsolete model or something and like an obsolete model or something and you know it was less like two and a half you know it was less like two and a half you know it was less like two and a half months or something. It's like the the months or something. It's like the the months or something. It's like the the time scales are the time scales are time scales are the time scales are time scales are the time scales are compressing. And I often say that uh compressing. And I often say that uh compressing. And I often say that uh being in the AI field, I will go on a being in the AI field, I will go on a being in the AI field, I will go on a very brief digression. Be being in the very brief digression. Be being in the very brief digression. Be being in the AI field, it feels like you're getting AI field, it feels like you're getting AI field, it feels like you're getting on a a spaceship from leaving Earth at on a a spaceship from leaving Earth at on a a spaceship from leaving Earth at relativistic speeds. And uh you know, relativistic speeds. And uh you know, relativistic speeds. And uh you know, one day you wake up and you know, it's one day you wake up and you know, it's one day you wake up and you know, it's like you know, one day on your like you know, one day on your like you know, one day on your spaceship, two days on Earth. So you spaceship, two days on Earth. So you spaceship, two days on Earth. So you have to take in the news of two days, it have to take in the news of two days, it have to take in the news of two days, it accelerates. One day on your spaceship, accelerates. One day on your spaceship, accelerates. One day on your spaceship, three days on Earth. And and and you three days on Earth. And and and you three days on Earth. And and and you know that that's that's just what it know that that's that's just what it know that that's that's just what it feels like being being on this ride. feels like being being on this ride. feels like being being on this ride. That resonates. I've heard the metaphor That resonates. I've heard the metaphor That resonates. I've heard the metaphor before, but it absolutely does. Um, before, but it absolutely does. Um, before, but it absolutely does. Um, maybe on the post- training front, one maybe on the post- training front, one maybe on the post- training front, one of the things that I got really excited of the things that I got really excited of the things that I got really excited about seeing developed in Cloud 4 has about seeing developed in Cloud 4 has about seeing developed in Cloud 4 has been this concept of memory and having been this concept of memory and having been this concept of memory and having the the model being able to manage its the the model being able to manage its the the model being able to manage its memory. Maybe talk a sec about why memory. Maybe talk a sec about why memory. Maybe talk a sec about why that's important and what that kind of that's important and what that kind of that's important and what that kind of enables. Uh, sorry, repeat the question. enables. Uh, sorry, repeat the question. enables. Uh, sorry, repeat the question. Like for uh the model to be able to Like for uh the model to be able to Like for uh the model to be able to manage its own memory and be able to manage its own memory and be able to manage its own memory and be able to handle those long horizon tasks as well. handle those long horizon tasks as well. handle those long horizon tasks as well. Yes. Yes, we have found that to be uh Yes. Yes, we have found that to be uh Yes. Yes, we have found that to be uh very useful. I think one one place we very useful. I think one one place we very useful. I think one one place we found it to be useful is Pokemon, right? found it to be useful is Pokemon, right? found it to be useful is Pokemon, right? um uh where the model's able to like um uh where the model's able to like um uh where the model's able to like remember its state, but you know, remember its state, but you know, remember its state, but you know, presumably it's it's useful for many presumably it's it's useful for many presumably it's it's useful for many things other than just Pokemon. Um uh uh things other than just Pokemon. Um uh uh things other than just Pokemon. Um uh uh but uh um no I think I think it's great but uh um no I think I think it's great but uh um no I think I think it's great that you know the model you know just as that you know the model you know just as that you know the model you know just as a human would like when I'm thinking a human would like when I'm thinking a human would like when I'm thinking I'll write a bunch of notes and uh you I'll write a bunch of notes and uh you I'll write a bunch of notes and uh you know then I'll like recall those notes know then I'll like recall those notes know then I'll like recall those notes at a later time or you know that there's at a later time or you know that there's at a later time or you know that there's just a lot of lot of intermediate work just a lot of lot of intermediate work just a lot of lot of intermediate work that I have to do that that you know and that I have to do that that you know and that I have to do that that you know and models do that to some extent when they models do that to some extent when they models do that to some extent when they when they reason when they have you know when they reason when they have you know when they reason when they have you know like our our reasoning traces but uh you like our our reasoning traces but uh you like our our reasoning traces but uh you know not not everything I do can be know not not everything I do can be know not not everything I do can be incorporated in one scratch pad right incorporated in one scratch pad right incorporated in one scratch pad right there's like presentations, there's um there's like presentations, there's um there's like presentations, there's um you know individual documents that I you know individual documents that I you know individual documents that I that I write and so models are the same, that I write and so models are the same, that I write and so models are the same, right? The the idea for them to kind of right? The the idea for them to kind of right? The the idea for them to kind of you know be able to create files to do you know be able to create files to do you know be able to create files to do things with those files to load data and things with those files to load data and things with those files to load data and to kind of seamlessly interle those to kind of seamlessly interle those to kind of seamlessly interle those things, right? The the one of the new things, right? The the one of the new things, right? The the one of the new features that we have is this this kind features that we have is this this kind features that we have is this this kind of interled re interled reasoning and of interled re interled reasoning and of interled re interled reasoning and taking actions and some of those actions taking actions and some of those actions taking actions and some of those actions can be storing data, recalling data. can be storing data, recalling data. can be storing data, recalling data. Again, the affordances that the models Again, the affordances that the models Again, the affordances that the models have are gradually converging towards have are gradually converging towards have are gradually converging towards the affordances that a human has, which the affordances that a human has, which the affordances that a human has, which I think is is the way that it should be. I think is is the way that it should be. I think is is the way that it should be. One of my mind-blowing moments in Cloud One of my mind-blowing moments in Cloud One of my mind-blowing moments in Cloud 4 so far was we added like basically a 4 so far was we added like basically a 4 so far was we added like basically a to-do list scratch pad to cloud code and to-do list scratch pad to cloud code and to-do list scratch pad to cloud code and just watching it churn through the to-do just watching it churn through the to-do just watching it churn through the to-do list and then as it thought of more list and then as it thought of more list and then as it thought of more things to do, add to the to-do list, things to do, add to the to-do list, things to do, add to the to-do list, check things off, strike out what was no check things off, strike out what was no check things off, strike out what was no longer relevant. It really mimics, I longer relevant. It really mimics, I longer relevant. It really mimics, I think, how people manage their own work think, how people manage their own work think, how people manage their own work and how they think about uh completion and how they think about uh completion and how they think about uh completion along the way. And then the interled along the way. And then the interled along the way. And then the interled reasoning uh and tool use as well. I saw reasoning uh and tool use as well. I saw reasoning uh and tool use as well. I saw a write up this morning on Mac stories a write up this morning on Mac stories a write up this morning on Mac stories where it was using a tool. It was an MCP where it was using a tool. It was an MCP where it was using a tool. It was an MCP and it hit a rate limit with the backend and it hit a rate limit with the backend and it hit a rate limit with the backend MCP server. And because it was doing the MCP server. And because it was doing the MCP server. And because it was doing the reasoning it was long was like I reasoning it was long was like I reasoning it was long was like I probably hit a rate limit. Let me try probably hit a rate limit. Let me try probably hit a rate limit. Let me try this other approach to do this as well. this other approach to do this as well. this other approach to do this as well. And so like that ability to reason and And so like that ability to reason and And so like that ability to reason and remediate as part of tool use I think is remediate as part of tool use I think is remediate as part of tool use I think is is really powerful. Um I'd love to touch is really powerful. Um I'd love to touch is really powerful. Um I'd love to touch on race to the top. So um uh safety and on race to the top. So um uh safety and on race to the top. So um uh safety and and capabilities are often you know uh and capabilities are often you know uh and capabilities are often you know uh thought of as being at odds with each thought of as being at odds with each thought of as being at odds with each other and your thesis is exactly the other and your thesis is exactly the other and your thesis is exactly the opposite and that these two things can opposite and that these two things can opposite and that these two things can move in tandem. I found that very move in tandem. I found that very move in tandem. I found that very inspiring and one of the reasons I inspiring and one of the reasons I inspiring and one of the reasons I joined here but maybe touch on how you joined here but maybe touch on how you joined here but maybe touch on how you think of of race to the top. Yeah. So, think of of race to the top. Yeah. So, think of of race to the top. Yeah. So, you know, I think I think it it it uh you know, I think I think it it it uh you know, I think I think it it it uh applies to things, you know, from the applies to things, you know, from the applies to things, you know, from the from the uh from the very mundane and from the uh from the very mundane and from the uh from the very mundane and simple and commercial to kind of, you simple and commercial to kind of, you simple and commercial to kind of, you know, the grand directions that that know, the grand directions that that know, the grand directions that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that AI is going in the future. Um so, that AI is going in the future. Um so, that AI is going in the future. Um so, you know, I you know, I think I think you know, I you know, I think I think you know, I you know, I think I think when we when we talk to customers, we when we when we talk to customers, we when we when we talk to customers, we have a number of customers who, you have a number of customers who, you have a number of customers who, you know, care a lot about making sure that know, care a lot about making sure that know, care a lot about making sure that the behavior of their AI models is the behavior of their AI models is the behavior of their AI models is predictable, that it's trustworthy. Um predictable, that it's trustworthy. Um predictable, that it's trustworthy. Um uh and I think that's aligned with what uh and I think that's aligned with what uh and I think that's aligned with what some of we're what what we're trying to some of we're what what we're trying to some of we're what what we're trying to do in long term for uh you know making do in long term for uh you know making do in long term for uh you know making sure that models in a more grand sense sure that models in a more grand sense sure that models in a more grand sense stay in line with human intent. Um so stay in line with human intent. Um so stay in line with human intent. Um so there's there's this nice there's this there's there's this nice there's this there's there's this nice there's this nice synergy here and you know I think nice synergy here and you know I think nice synergy here and you know I think whenever we're able to do so whenever we whenever we're able to do so whenever we whenever we're able to do so whenever we think it's reasonable or responsible to think it's reasonable or responsible to think it's reasonable or responsible to do so we do want to provide tools for do so we do want to provide tools for do so we do want to provide tools for the community. So M MC MCP MCP is an the community. So M MC MCP MCP is an the community. So M MC MCP MCP is an example of that. Um I I myself was example of that. Um I I myself was example of that. Um I I myself was actually surprised at the the pace at actually surprised at the the pace at actually surprised at the the pace at which everyone seems to have which everyone seems to have which everyone seems to have standardized around around MCP. I mean standardized around around MCP. I mean standardized around around MCP. I mean it was it was very strange. We released it was it was very strange. We released it was it was very strange. We released it in November. I wouldn't say there was it in November. I wouldn't say there was it in November. I wouldn't say there was like a huge reaction immediately but like a huge reaction immediately but like a huge reaction immediately but then but then within 3 or 4 months it then but then within 3 or 4 months it then but then within 3 or 4 months it you know it kind of become it kind of you know it kind of become it kind of you know it kind of become it kind of become the standard. Again, there's become the standard. Again, there's become the standard. Again, there's again this this feeling of like being on again this this feeling of like being on again this this feeling of like being on the spaceship accelerating from Earth the spaceship accelerating from Earth the spaceship accelerating from Earth and and and you know, experiencing, you and and and you know, experiencing, you and and and you know, experiencing, you know, larger and larger time time know, larger and larger time time know, larger and larger time time dilation constants. Um where it's, you dilation constants. Um where it's, you dilation constants. Um where it's, you know, like, you know, think of like USB know, like, you know, think of like USB know, like, you know, think of like USB and other standards, you know, think of and other standards, you know, think of and other standards, you know, think of like standards in the '9s or the two like standards in the '9s or the two like standards in the '9s or the two like, you know, this would take it would like, you know, this would take it would like, you know, this would take it would take years for people to converge on take years for people to converge on take years for people to converge on something. Yeah. And even in talking to something. Yeah. And even in talking to something. Yeah. And even in talking to other participants in the industry other participants in the industry other participants in the industry around MCP they're like we don't want to around MCP they're like we don't want to around MCP they're like we don't want to slow down whatever is working on MCP slow down whatever is working on MCP slow down whatever is working on MCP like we do want like some you know help like we do want like some you know help like we do want like some you know help on steering but like this is you've on steering but like this is you've on steering but like this is you've captured lightning in a bottle. Let's captured lightning in a bottle. Let's captured lightning in a bottle. Let's make sure it becomes the new protocol make sure it becomes the new protocol make sure it becomes the new protocol and the standard by which we and the standard by which we and the standard by which we interoperate agents as well. Um uh maybe interoperate agents as well. Um uh maybe interoperate agents as well. Um uh maybe tied together the race to the top. I tied together the race to the top. I tied together the race to the top. I loved your urgency of interpretability loved your urgency of interpretability loved your urgency of interpretability essay. You have a background in essay. You have a background in essay. You have a background in neuroscience as well. Can you talk a neuroscience as well. Can you talk a neuroscience as well. Can you talk a little bit about how you see the little bit about how you see the little bit about how you see the co-development of interpretability and co-development of interpretability and co-development of interpretability and um machine intelligence? Yeah. So um you um machine intelligence? Yeah. So um you um machine intelligence? Yeah. So um you know I think 10 years ago uh many people know I think 10 years ago uh many people know I think 10 years ago uh many people thought that neuroscience would tell us thought that neuroscience would tell us thought that neuroscience would tell us about how to do AI. Um uh and indeed about how to do AI. Um uh and indeed about how to do AI. Um uh and indeed there you know are a number of former there you know are a number of former there you know are a number of former neuroscientists in the field. I'm not neuroscientists in the field. I'm not neuroscientists in the field. I'm not I'm not the only one there. You know I'm not the only one there. You know I'm not the only one there. You know there are other lab leaders some who there are other lab leaders some who there are other lab leaders some who have that uh who have that background. have that uh who have that background. have that uh who have that background. Um and you know I found at a high level Um and you know I found at a high level Um and you know I found at a high level there's some inspiration but I wouldn't there's some inspiration but I wouldn't there's some inspiration but I wouldn't say I've said oh you know this is how say I've said oh you know this is how say I've said oh you know this is how the you know this thing we know from the the you know this thing we know from the the you know this thing we know from the hypothalamus we can use for you know for hypothalamus we can use for you know for hypothalamus we can use for you know for for for making these models. It's it's for for making these models. It's it's for for making these models. It's it's all been pretty much from scratch. But all been pretty much from scratch. But all been pretty much from scratch. But interestingly things have gone the other interestingly things have gone the other interestingly things have gone the other way more which is that using way more which is that using way more which is that using interpretability we're able to see interpretability we're able to see interpretability we're able to see inside models. And although of course inside models. And although of course inside models. And although of course they're not ex made in exactly the same they're not ex made in exactly the same they're not ex made in exactly the same way the human brain is at at a you know way the human brain is at at a you know way the human brain is at at a you know the a kind of superficial level there's the a kind of superficial level there's the a kind of superficial level there's there's a lot of differences a lot of there's a lot of differences a lot of there's a lot of differences a lot of the conceptual patterns we have found the conceptual patterns we have found the conceptual patterns we have found inside inside inside models sometimes they then get models sometimes they then get models sometimes they then get replicated in replicated in neuroscience replicated in replicated in neuroscience replicated in replicated in neuroscience research there was something about like research there was something about like research there was something about like high low frequency detectors in vision high low frequency detectors in vision high low frequency detectors in vision um that uh was found via um that uh was found via um that uh was found via interpretability via via one of one of interpretability via via one of one of interpretability via via one of one of the people on Chris Ola's team and then the people on Chris Ola's team and then the people on Chris Ola's team and then a couple years later a neuroscientist a couple years later a neuroscientist a couple years later a neuroscientist actually replicated it in in animal actually replicated it in in animal actually replicated it in in animal brains. Um the idea that for example brains. Um the idea that for example brains. Um the idea that for example vision models separate out you know they vision models separate out you know they vision models separate out you know they have one path that that tends to have one path that that tends to have one path that that tends to correspond to color and you know another correspond to color and you know another correspond to color and you know another path that corresponds to uh you know uh path that corresponds to uh you know uh path that corresponds to uh you know uh h brightness or to the boundaries h brightness or to the boundaries h brightness or to the boundaries between objects. These seem to be between objects. These seem to be between objects. These seem to be natural distinctions in the world, natural distinctions in the world, natural distinctions in the world, right? That are that are kind of there right? That are that are kind of there right? That are that are kind of there to be discovered. And anytime you have to be discovered. And anytime you have to be discovered. And anytime you have any kind of abstract learning system, any kind of abstract learning system, any kind of abstract learning system, whether it's artificial or biological, whether it's artificial or biological, whether it's artificial or biological, you kind of discover the same thing. So, you kind of discover the same thing. So, you kind of discover the same thing. So, it's very interesting. I'm really it's very interesting. I'm really it's very interesting. I'm really curious how the circuits paper ends up curious how the circuits paper ends up curious how the circuits paper ends up affecting neuroscience research as well. affecting neuroscience research as well. affecting neuroscience research as well. Um, let's move into the 5 to 10 year Um, let's move into the 5 to 10 year Um, let's move into the 5 to 10 year time horizon. Um, to the extent that time horizon. Um, to the extent that time horizon. Um, to the extent that that is even possible in AI as as we that is even possible in AI as as we that is even possible in AI as as we move relativistically, maybe move relativistically, maybe move relativistically, maybe relativistically that's probably one relativistically that's probably one relativistically that's probably one year in real time. Um, when do you think year in real time. Um, when do you think year in real time. Um, when do you think there'll be the first billion dollar there'll be the first billion dollar there'll be the first billion dollar company with one human employee? 2026. company with one human employee? 2026. company with one human employee? 2026. Yeah. No, I absolutely about that. Yeah. No, I absolutely about that. Yeah. No, I absolutely about that. Um, do you have any advice for people Um, do you have any advice for people Um, do you have any advice for people building with Claude um for the next building with Claude um for the next building with Claude um for the next year? How to think about building at year? How to think about building at year? How to think about building at that frontier as well? Yeah. Um, I, you that frontier as well? Yeah. Um, I, you that frontier as well? Yeah. Um, I, you know, I think there's like a lot of very know, I think there's like a lot of very know, I think there's like a lot of very specific things you could say about like specific things you could say about like specific things you could say about like how about how to use the models, but I how about how to use the models, but I how about how to use the models, but I feel like because of this whole like feel like because of this whole like feel like because of this whole like relativistic time dilation thing, this relativistic time dilation thing, this relativistic time dilation thing, this like speeding things up, like almost all like speeding things up, like almost all like speeding things up, like almost all the advice is drowned out by like one the advice is drowned out by like one the advice is drowned out by like one sentence, which is or maybe two words, sentence, which is or maybe two words, sentence, which is or maybe two words, which is just be ambitious. Um, like which is just be ambitious. Um, like which is just be ambitious. Um, like build something that's greater than you build something that's greater than you build something that's greater than you think is is possible. And even if it think is is possible. And even if it think is is possible. And even if it doesn't quite work yet, another model doesn't quite work yet, another model doesn't quite work yet, another model will come out in the next generation, will come out in the next generation, will come out in the next generation, which right now is three months, but which right now is three months, but which right now is three months, but like probably it's going to go down to like probably it's going to go down to like probably it's going to go down to two months, then one month, and you two months, then one month, and you two months, then one month, and you know, then then if I want to come up know, then then if I want to come up know, then then if I want to come up this year, maybe I'll be giving advice this year, maybe I'll be giving advice this year, maybe I'll be giving advice that's like, oh, you know, don't build that's like, oh, you know, don't build that's like, oh, you know, don't build anything today. You know, we're anything today. You know, we're anything today. You know, we're releasing something today, but by releasing something today, but by releasing something today, but by tonight it'll be, you know, you won't tonight it'll be, you know, you won't tonight it'll be, you know, you won't want to be building with this tonight. I want to be building with this tonight. I want to be building with this tonight. I talked to a founder who started a talked to a founder who started a talked to a founder who started a company two years ago in the sort of company two years ago in the sort of company two years ago in the sort of autonomous AI coding agent space and he autonomous AI coding agent space and he autonomous AI coding agent space and he basically tried every single model and basically tried every single model and basically tried every single model and his startup wasn't working and then it his startup wasn't working and then it his startup wasn't working and then it was actually 37 where he's like my was actually 37 where he's like my was actually 37 where he's like my startup works now and it was the same startup works now and it was the same startup works now and it was the same thing of like this thing that I was thing of like this thing that I was thing of like this thing that I was trying that was really hard all of a trying that was really hard all of a trying that was really hard all of a sudden is now um possible but hitting sudden is now um possible but hitting sudden is now um possible but hitting your head against the wall actually your head against the wall actually your head against the wall actually sometimes can be useful because you put sometimes can be useful because you put sometimes can be useful because you put all the other pieces in place and and all the other pieces in place and and all the other pieces in place and and everything works except the model and everything works except the model and everything works except the model and then when the model works it's almost then when the model works it's almost then when the model works it's almost like you've built something that's like like you've built something that's like like you've built something that's like more robust than it needs to And that more robust than it needs to And that more robust than it needs to And that can be can be can be like, so you know, as much as I joke like, so you know, as much as I joke like, so you know, as much as I joke about like, oh, you should, you know, about like, oh, you should, you know, about like, oh, you should, you know, you can just wait for the next model, you can just wait for the next model, you can just wait for the next model, actually hitting your head against the actually hitting your head against the actually hitting your head against the wall, as long as it's something that's wall, as long as it's something that's wall, as long as it's something that's like almost possible, if it's not like, like almost possible, if it's not like, like almost possible, if it's not like, you know, like 3 years out from from you know, like 3 years out from from you know, like 3 years out from from what's possible. Um, I think it can what's possible. Um, I think it can what's possible. Um, I think it can actually be productive. We saw that even actually be productive. We saw that even actually be productive. We saw that even with advanced research internally, like with advanced research internally, like with advanced research internally, like our our research and cloud skills team our our research and cloud skills team our our research and cloud skills team had built a prototype of this. The model had built a prototype of this. The model had built a prototype of this. The model kind of lost its way. It wasn't good at kind of lost its way. It wasn't good at kind of lost its way. It wasn't good at using tools. And then with 3. 7, using tools. And then with 3. 7, using tools. And then with 3. 7, especially with cloud 4, I think you'll especially with cloud 4, I think you'll especially with cloud 4, I think you'll find that it does advanced research find that it does advanced research find that it does advanced research really, really well as well. And it's really, really well as well. And it's really, really well as well. And it's because we were trying and kind of because we were trying and kind of because we were trying and kind of failing along the way as well. Yeah, failing along the way as well. Yeah, failing along the way as well. Yeah, it's it's almost as if you want to run it's it's almost as if you want to run it's it's almost as if you want to run your you want to run your startup as your you want to run your startup as your you want to run your startup as like speculative execution against the like speculative execution against the like speculative execution against the next model, right? There's some kind of next model, right? There's some kind of next model, right? There's some kind of like I don't know. I love that. Yeah, I like I don't know. I love that. Yeah, I like I don't know. I love that. Yeah, I think that's exactly right. Um all think that's exactly right. Um all think that's exactly right. Um all right, so last question to wrap up. Um right, so last question to wrap up. Um right, so last question to wrap up. Um for many of us today, um who aren't for many of us today, um who aren't for many of us today, um who aren't Dario, we couldn't have imagined the Dario, we couldn't have imagined the Dario, we couldn't have imagined the progress that AI has made and the rapid progress that AI has made and the rapid progress that AI has made and the rapid pace of change. what are you most pace of change. what are you most pace of change. what are you most excited about for the coming year and excited about for the coming year and excited about for the coming year and then the next five years? Um yeah so uh then the next five years? Um yeah so uh then the next five years? Um yeah so uh I think for in the next coming year uh I think for in the next coming year uh I think for in the next coming year uh we are going to see incredible things in we are going to see incredible things in we are going to see incredible things in in in code. I would refer again to kind in in code. I would refer again to kind in in code. I would refer again to kind of the you know taking where we are with of the you know taking where we are with of the you know taking where we are with cloud code and where we are with the cloud code and where we are with the cloud code and where we are with the coding models and going from there to coding models and going from there to coding models and going from there to kind of to kind of the agent fleets. Um kind of to kind of the agent fleets. Um kind of to kind of the agent fleets. Um I think this will have an interesting I think this will have an interesting I think this will have an interesting effect in the world which is I don't effect in the world which is I don't effect in the world which is I don't know that we've thought carefully like know that we've thought carefully like know that we've thought carefully like from an economic or business perspective from an economic or business perspective from an economic or business perspective about what happens when the cost of about what happens when the cost of about what happens when the cost of producing software goes down. It's kind producing software goes down. It's kind producing software goes down. It's kind of an assumption an article of faith of an assumption an article of faith of an assumption an article of faith that you only make software if it's only that you only make software if it's only that you only make software if it's only worth it to make it if millions of worth it to make it if millions of worth it to make it if millions of people use it or at least hundreds of people use it or at least hundreds of people use it or at least hundreds of thousands or maybe tens of thousands. thousands or maybe tens of thousands. thousands or maybe tens of thousands. like you wouldn't make you you know you like you wouldn't make you you know you like you wouldn't make you you know you you you you like wouldn't make a whole you you you like wouldn't make a whole you you you like wouldn't make a whole piece of software for this event, right? piece of software for this event, right? piece of software for this event, right? Like you might throw together something, Like you might throw together something, Like you might throw together something, but like when it just becomes really but like when it just becomes really but like when it just becomes really cheap when it costs you 20 cents to like cheap when it costs you 20 cents to like cheap when it costs you 20 cents to like oh let's just let's just throw let's oh let's just let's just throw let's oh let's just let's just throw let's just throw together something that you just throw together something that you just throw together something that you know you know changes you know ch know you know changes you know ch know you know changes you know ch changes my vision for this particular changes my vision for this particular changes my vision for this particular event or something like that. Um uh I event or something like that. Um uh I event or something like that. Um uh I think the world is going to be very think the world is going to be very think the world is going to be very different when these things can be made different when these things can be made different when these things can be made ad hoc on a on a one one one oneoff ad hoc on a on a one one one oneoff ad hoc on a on a one one one oneoff basis in like a few seconds for for less basis in like a few seconds for for less basis in like a few seconds for for less than a for for for less than a dollar. than a for for for less than a dollar. than a for for for less than a dollar. What are what is the role of the What are what is the role of the What are what is the role of the developer there? What is the role of developer there? What is the role of developer there? What is the role of businesses? What is the role of businesses? What is the role of businesses? What is the role of startups? Um and what is what is the startups? Um and what is what is the startups? Um and what is what is the experience of the of the you know of the experience of the of the you know of the experience of the of the you know of the of the people using it? I think we don't of the people using it? I think we don't of the people using it? I think we don't know the answer to any of those know the answer to any of those know the answer to any of those questions. So that's very interesting. questions. So that's very interesting. questions. So that's very interesting. On the on the fiveyear time scale I will On the on the fiveyear time scale I will On the on the fiveyear time scale I will return again to biology. I think the return again to biology. I think the return again to biology. I think the biomedical stuff will not be biomedical stuff will not be biomedical stuff will not be revolutionized in the next year because revolutionized in the next year because revolutionized in the next year because it's it's kind of you know slow to slow it's it's kind of you know slow to slow it's it's kind of you know slow to slow to happen but uh yeah yeah I hope that to happen but uh yeah yeah I hope that to happen but uh yeah yeah I hope that uh five years from now we will have uh uh five years from now we will have uh uh five years from now we will have uh vanquished uh many of the diseases that vanquished uh many of the diseases that vanquished uh many of the diseases that now uh that now exist. I love we'll now uh that now exist. I love we'll now uh that now exist. I love we'll leave it with that. Unfortunately we do leave it with that. Unfortunately we do leave it with that. Unfortunately we do have to wrap up. I feel like we could have to wrap up. I feel like we could have to wrap up. I feel like we could talk for another 40 minutes. So first I talk for another 40 minutes. So first I talk for another 40 minutes. So first I want to thank Daario for spending time want to thank Daario for spending time want to thank Daario for spending time with us today. Thank you Dario.

Um as a special almost forgot one thing. Um as a special thank you to everyone who joined us thank you to everyone who joined us thank you to everyone who joined us today at Code with Cloud in person. I'm today at Code with Cloud in person. I'm today at Code with Cloud in person. I'm excited to announce that each of you excited to announce that each of you excited to announce that each of you will receive free access to Max 20x uh will receive free access to Max 20x uh will receive free access to Max 20x uh our highest tier plan for 3 months. So our highest tier plan for 3 months. So our highest tier plan for 3 months. So look out for that. I especially love using Max with Cloud I especially love using Max with Cloud I especially love using Max with Cloud Code, so you'll be able to do that as Code, so you'll be able to do that as Code, so you'll be able to do that as well. So, we can't wait to see what you well. So, we can't wait to see what you well. So, we can't wait to see what you build. Have a great rest of your day build. Have a great rest of your day build. Have a great rest of your day with the different um sessions and with the different um sessions and with the different um sessions and welcome again to Code with Claude. welcome again to Code with Claude. welcome again to Code with Claude. Thanks for coming. Thanks for coming Thanks for coming. Thanks for coming Thanks for coming. Thanks for coming everyone. everyone. everyone. [Applause]
