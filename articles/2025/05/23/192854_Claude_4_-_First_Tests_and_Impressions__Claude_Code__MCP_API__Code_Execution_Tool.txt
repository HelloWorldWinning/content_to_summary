好的，以下是总结内容：

**核心思想与结构化大纲：**

1.  **Claude 4 发布及其能力展示：**
    *   介绍 Anthropic 最新发布的 Claude 4 模型 (Opus 和 Sonnet)。
    *   初步印象：Sonnet 速度与 Claude 3.7 相似，Opus 可能稍慢，但总体"就是好用"。
2.  **新核心功能演示：**
    *   **代码执行工具：**
        *   允许 Claude 在安全沙箱中执行 Python 代码。
        *   演示：使用 Claude Sonnet 代理构思数学问题解决方案，然后将代码发送给 Claude Opus 执行和测试，并返回结构化报告。
        *   强调工具易于设置和使用。
    *   **MCP 连接器：**
        *   允许连接第三方 MCP 服务器（如 sequential thinking, fetch）到 Claude API。
        *   演示：
            *   连接 sequential thinking 服务器解决数学问题，展示逐步推理过程。
            *   连接 fetch 服务器获取 URL 内容（MCP 连接器文档），展示信息检索能力。
        *   强调连接器易于设置和切换不同服务器。
    *   **Claude 视觉 API (Vision API)：**
        *   在后续的应用迭代中用于精确识别物体，取代早期不太精确的 TensorFlow 识别。
3.  **实际应用演示：**
    *   **基于物体识别生成诗歌的应用：**
        *   一个使用网络摄像头识别物体、将物体名称列表化（需要三个物体）。
        *   使用 Claude Opus 基于物体列表生成短诗。
        *   使用 11 Labs API 将诗歌朗读出来并在应用中播放。
        *   演示了应用从早期物体识别不准确到使用 Claude Vision API 后识别准确性的提升。
4.  **相关信息：**
    *   赞助商：Nvidia GTC 巴黎大会，提及日期、地点、嘉宾、会议亮点（AI 代理、量子计算）、研讨会及抽奖活动。
    *   Cursor IDE 已添加 Claude 4 支持。

**核心结论点：**

Claude 4 及其配套工具（代码执行、MCP 连接器、Vision API）是强大且易于集成的能力，显著增强了构建复杂 AI 应用的可能性，并且初步测试表明其性能可靠"就是好用"。

**总体框架：**

通过**演示** Anthropic Claude 4 模型及其新发布的关键功能（代码执行工具、MCP 连接器、Vision API），并结合一个**实际应用示例**（物体识别->诗歌生成->朗读），展示 Claude 4 的能力、易用性和在构建多模态、多工具复杂工作流中的潜力，同时穿插**行业相关信息**（赞助商、IDE 集成）。

Okay, so pretty exciting day if you are into AI and exciting day if you are into AI and exciting day if you are into AI and LLMs. Uh introducing Claude 4 from LLMs. Uh introducing Claude 4 from LLMs. Uh introducing Claude 4 from Antropic. Uh, as probably a lot of you, Antropic. Uh, as probably a lot of you, Antropic. Uh, as probably a lot of you, including me, have been waiting for including me, have been waiting for including me, have been waiting for this. So, we have the two new models, this. So, we have the two new models, this. So, we have the two new models, Claude for Opus, Claude for Sonnet or Claude for Opus, Claude for Sonnet or Claude for Opus, Claude for Sonnet or Set 4. Uh, I looked kind of quickly at Set 4. Uh, I looked kind of quickly at Set 4. Uh, I looked kind of quickly at the benchmarks here and it looks pretty the benchmarks here and it looks pretty the benchmarks here and it looks pretty strong. They kind of highlight software strong. They kind of highlight software strong.

Also, other good results here. Also, other good results here. Also, other benchmarks here look pretty strong. Uh, benchmarks here look pretty strong. Uh, benchmarks here look pretty strong. Uh, so, but we going to focus mostly on kind so, but we going to focus mostly on kind so, but we going to focus mostly on kind of the new capabilities we have here. of the new capabilities we have here. of the new capabilities we have here. So, this is like in the Antropic API So, this is like in the Antropic API So, this is like in the Antropic API today. Uh, we have the code execution today. Uh, we have the code execution today. Uh, we have the code execution tool we're going to try out. That's tool we're going to try out. That's tool we're going to try out. That's going to be exciting. We have the MCP going to be exciting. We have the MCP going to be exciting. We have the MCP connector. This means that we can now connector. This means that we can now connector. This means that we can now connect MCP service to the API. We're connect MCP service to the API. We're connect MCP service to the API. We're going to try that out. Uh, we're going going to try that out. Uh, we're going going to try that out. Uh, we're going to spend time in cloud code. Building a to spend time in cloud code. Building a to spend time in cloud code. Building a couple of projects I think using cloud couple of projects I think using cloud couple of projects I think using cloud for Sonet. That's going to be exciting for Sonet. That's going to be exciting for Sonet. That's going to be exciting too. So, yeah, let's just dive into it. too. So, yeah, let's just dive into it. too. So, yeah, let's just dive into it. Let's see what we can do with the new Let's see what we can do with the new Let's see what we can do with the new cloud for mobile. So, let's just start cloud for mobile. So, let's just start cloud for mobile. So, let's just start here on cloud code. And I thought we can here on cloud code. And I thought we can here on cloud code. And I thought we can use cloud code to actually build a use cloud code to actually build a use cloud code to actually build a example of how we can use the new cloud example of how we can use the new cloud example of how we can use the new cloud execution tool. So if we ask cloud code execution tool. So if we ask cloud code execution tool. So if we ask cloud code what model are you using? You can see we what model are you using? You can see we what model are you using? You can see we are using kind of the new claude for set are using kind of the new claude for set are using kind of the new claude for set here. Cloud for cloud sonet for and we here. Cloud for cloud sonet for and we here. Cloud for cloud sonet for and we have the model number. Perfect. So what have the model number. Perfect. So what have the model number. Perfect. So what I want to do uh I I went ahead I I want to do uh I I went ahead I I want to do uh I I went ahead I gathered some documentation about the gathered some documentation about the gathered some documentation about the new claude code not cloud code execution new claude code not cloud code execution new claude code not cloud code execution tool. I'm just going to do a simple tool. I'm just going to do a simple tool. I'm just going to do a simple test. So basically this execution tool test. So basically this execution tool test. So basically this execution tool allows cloud to execute Python code in a allows cloud to execute Python code in a allows cloud to execute Python code in a secure sandbox environment. We've seen secure sandbox environment. We've seen secure sandbox environment. We've seen this before. I just want to see how easy this before. I just want to see how easy this before. I just want to see how easy it is to set up. Now uh we can use this it is to set up. Now uh we can use this it is to set up. Now uh we can use this on Opus 2 uh and all the other models on Opus 2 uh and all the other models on Opus 2 uh and all the other models 3. 7. So that's pretty interesting. Maybe 3. 7. So that's pretty interesting. Maybe 3. 7. So that's pretty interesting. Maybe we should try to run this execution tool we should try to run this execution tool we should try to run this execution tool on cloud opus. Yeah, let's do that. So on cloud opus. Yeah, let's do that. So on cloud opus. Yeah, let's do that. So uh I'm just going to come up with a uh I'm just going to come up with a uh I'm just going to come up with a prompt here. We're going to use this prompt here. We're going to use this prompt here. We're going to use this environment in the cloud 4 directory. I environment in the cloud 4 directory. I environment in the cloud 4 directory. I have the prompt uh let's create a test have the prompt uh let's create a test have the prompt uh let's create a test of the new cloud execution tool. I have of the new cloud execution tool. I have of the new cloud execution tool. I have some documentation I set up. So I want some documentation I set up. So I want some documentation I set up. So I want to set up a test uh to show how the tool to set up a test uh to show how the tool to set up a test uh to show how the tool works with the new cloud opus for model. works with the new cloud opus for model. works with the new cloud opus for model. So the workflow I want to do is like a So the workflow I want to do is like a So the workflow I want to do is like a cloud for sonet agent brainstorms a cloud for sonet agent brainstorms a cloud for sonet agent brainstorms a solution to a problem given by the user solution to a problem given by the user solution to a problem given by the user using the cloud API. Uh the second part using the cloud API. Uh the second part using the cloud API. Uh the second part is that the code the AI agent suggest is that the code the AI agent suggest is that the code the AI agent suggest will be sent to the cloud for opus for will be sent to the cloud for opus for will be sent to the cloud for opus for testing and execution using cloud testing and execution using cloud testing and execution using cloud execution tool and we're going to report execution tool and we're going to report execution tool and we're going to report back to the user with the results from back to the user with the results from back to the user with the results from the test and execution. Write the the test and execution. Write the the test and execution. Write the project for me please. So let's try to project for me please. So let's try to project for me please. So let's try to use um cloud code now to actually create use um cloud code now to actually create use um cloud code now to actually create this project and then we're going to this project and then we're going to this project and then we're going to test it out of course. So um you can see test it out of course. So um you can see test it out of course. So um you can see we get this nice update to-do list here. we get this nice update to-do list here. we get this nice update to-do list here. Uh I saw they did that in a demo. So Uh I saw they did that in a demo. So Uh I saw they did that in a demo. So they always keep tabs on this kind of they always keep tabs on this kind of they always keep tabs on this kind of this memory settings. So it always knows this memory settings. So it always knows this memory settings. So it always knows what to do next. And it kind of checks what to do next. And it kind of checks what to do next. And it kind of checks off what uh um task has been completed off what uh um task has been completed off what uh um task has been completed here. So we're going to create a here. So we're going to create a here. So we're going to create a requirements file. That's good. So my requirements file. That's good. So my requirements file. That's good. So my initial testing of Claude for Sonnet is initial testing of Claude for Sonnet is initial testing of Claude for Sonnet is that is uh the speed is kind of the same that is uh the speed is kind of the same that is uh the speed is kind of the same as 3. 7. I haven't noticed any negative as 3. 7. I haven't noticed any negative as 3. 7. I haven't noticed any negative difference. Uh I tested Opus. I think difference. Uh I tested Opus. I think difference. Uh I tested Opus. I think that's a bit slower, but I have to do that's a bit slower, but I have to do that's a bit slower, but I have to do more testing. It actually felt a bit more testing. It actually felt a bit more testing. It actually felt a bit slower when I tried it out. Okay, so slower when I tried it out. Okay, so slower when I tried it out. Okay, so this is our first uh cloth execution this is our first uh cloth execution this is our first uh cloth execution test. py. Yes, let's save that. So, I test. py. Yes, let's save that. So, I test. py. Yes, let's save that. So, I want to see if this is like a one sort want to see if this is like a one sort want to see if this is like a one sort solution or if you have to come back and solution or if you have to come back and solution or if you have to come back and do some iterations here. Okay, so we do some iterations here. Okay, so we do some iterations here. Okay, so we have a get started. So, we're going to have a get started. So, we're going to have a get started. So, we're going to do some pip install here. Maybe create do some pip install here. Maybe create do some pip install here. Maybe create an environment, add this, and just run an environment, add this, and just run an environment, add this, and just run it. Okay, the script includes a sample it. Okay, the script includes a sample it. Okay, the script includes a sample problem. Okay, that's fine. Okay, so I problem. Okay, that's fine. Okay, so I problem. Okay, that's fine. Okay, so I created my environment. Let's do a pip created my environment. Let's do a pip created my environment. Let's do a pip install here and the next step was going install here and the next step was going install here and the next step was going to be just to add the in the API file. to be just to add the in the API file. to be just to add the in the API file. We have done that. Then we can run this We have done that. Then we can run this We have done that. Then we can run this and let's just see what happens. Now and let's just see what happens. Now and let's just see what happens. Now when we run this, what's going to happen when we run this, what's going to happen when we run this, what's going to happen is we're going to generate a list of 20 is we're going to generate a list of 20 is we're going to generate a list of 20 random numbers between one and 100 mean, random numbers between one and 100 mean, random numbers between one and 100 mean, median, and standard deviation. Create a median, and standard deviation. Create a median, and standard deviation. Create a simple histogram showing simple histogram showing simple histogram showing distribution. Identify any outliers. So distribution. Identify any outliers. So distribution. Identify any outliers. So okay, that's fine. So Claude foret okay, that's fine. So Claude foret okay, that's fine. So Claude foret brainstorming solutions. So hopefully brainstorming solutions. So hopefully brainstorming solutions. So hopefully we'll get a Python code now that we will we'll get a Python code now that we will we'll get a Python code now that we will send to okay so Claude Opus is executing send to okay so Claude Opus is executing send to okay so Claude Opus is executing and testing the code. I kind of wanted and testing the code. I kind of wanted and testing the code. I kind of wanted to see a bit more of this. So we might to see a bit more of this. So we might to see a bit more of this. So we might add that to the program but let's see add that to the program but let's see add that to the program but let's see what we get as a result now. So we have what we get as a result now. So we have what we get as a result now. So we have a big response here. You can see step a big response here. You can see step a big response here. You can see step two uh compiling final report. So uh the two uh compiling final report. So uh the two uh compiling final report. So uh the cloth execution tool test final report cloth execution tool test final report cloth execution tool test final report overall uh workflow success true overall uh workflow success true overall uh workflow success true brainstorming. Okay. Uh problem and brainstorming. Okay. Uh problem and brainstorming. Okay. Uh problem and analysis complete solution. So we have analysis complete solution. So we have analysis complete solution. So we have kind of the solution for this problem. kind of the solution for this problem. kind of the solution for this problem. Uh I kind of want to test it out. So I'm Uh I kind of want to test it out. So I'm Uh I kind of want to test it out. So I'm going to try to copy that and run it. going to try to copy that and run it. going to try to copy that and run it. Edge cases and limitations. Empty list Edge cases and limitations. Empty list Edge cases and limitations. Empty list single element file paths. Okay. Uh single element file paths. Okay. Uh single element file paths. Okay. Uh handles well negative numbers. code handles well negative numbers. code handles well negative numbers. code quality assessments. Yeah, kind of like quality assessments. Yeah, kind of like quality assessments. Yeah, kind of like this report here. That's pretty good. this report here. That's pretty good. this report here. That's pretty good. So, overall assessment is So, overall assessment is So, overall assessment is B+ solid educational implementation. B+ solid educational implementation. B+ solid educational implementation. Okay. Uh let's try to run this code. So, Okay. Uh let's try to run this code. So, Okay. Uh let's try to run this code. So, this code should be tested now. But this code should be tested now. But this code should be tested now. But let's see. Yay, we got it. So, we have a let's see. Yay, we got it. So, we have a let's see. Yay, we got it. So, we have a distribution of random numbers. The mean distribution of random numbers. The mean distribution of random numbers. The mean is 43. That's kind of on the red line is 43. That's kind of on the red line is 43. That's kind of on the red line here. And if we run this again, we will here. And if we run this again, we will here. And if we run this again, we will probably get a different number. So probably get a different number. So probably get a different number. So remember mean 43. Okay. So now the mean remember mean 43. Okay. So now the mean remember mean 43. Okay. So now the mean was 58. Let's try again just to see that was 58. Let's try again just to see that was 58. Let's try again just to see that was quite high mean right? Uh now it's was quite high mean right? Uh now it's was quite high mean right? Uh now it's around 48. So it should be around 50. around 48. So it should be around 50. around 48. So it should be around 50. Let's try to do thousand random numbers Let's try to do thousand random numbers Let's try to do thousand random numbers just for fun. So now with th00and just for fun. So now with th00and just for fun. So now with th00and numbers this should be very close to 50, numbers this should be very close to 50, numbers this should be very close to 50, right? right? right? 50. 02. Let's see if that changes if we 50. 02. Let's see if that changes if we 50. 02. Let's see if that changes if we do it again. 52. That was quite high. do it again. 52. That was quite high. do it again. 52. That was quite high. 49. Okay. So you can see we are 49. Okay. So you can see we are 49. Okay. So you can see we are converging into 50. But the code is converging into 50. But the code is converging into 50. But the code is working. We have it tested. Everything working. We have it tested. Everything working. We have it tested. Everything was cool. But first, let's check out the was cool. But first, let's check out the was cool. But first, let's check out the cost. I forgot about that. So, let's do cost. I forgot about that. So, let's do cost. I forgot about that. So, let's do /cost. Uh, that was not too bad. Point /cost. Uh, that was not too bad. Point /cost. Uh, that was not too bad. Point uh almost $1. That's not too bad. Let me uh almost $1. That's not too bad. Let me uh almost $1. That's not too bad. Let me show you a quick other example before we show you a quick other example before we show you a quick other example before we move on to the next test. Okay. So, I move on to the next test. Okay. So, I move on to the next test. Okay. So, I did a quick test uh on how good Claude did a quick test uh on how good Claude did a quick test uh on how good Claude for Sonet is on kind of ASI art. So, for Sonet is on kind of ASI art. So, for Sonet is on kind of ASI art. So, let's check it out. Let's see the let's check it out. Let's see the let's check it out. Let's see the results here. So, I'm going to run this results here. So, I'm going to run this results here. So, I'm going to run this retro scroll. And what do we see retro scroll. And what do we see retro scroll. And what do we see here? What does this say? Nvidia GTC here? What does this say? Nvidia GTC here? What does this say? Nvidia GTC Paris June 11 to 12, 2025. Okay, so Paris June 11 to 12, 2025.

So a big in the description below. So a big thanks for Nvidia for sponsoring this thanks for Nvidia for sponsoring this thanks for Nvidia for sponsoring this segment. Now let's go back to the video. segment. Now let's go back to the video. segment. Now let's go back to the video. Okay. So let's try to use uh cloud code Okay. So let's try to use uh cloud code Okay. So let's try to use uh cloud code uh with sonet for now to create a an uh with sonet for now to create a an uh with sonet for now to create a an application that is kind of complicated. application that is kind of complicated. application that is kind of complicated. I'm not sure. So we need to build an app I'm not sure. So we need to build an app I'm not sure. So we need to build an app with the following feature. So the app with the following feature. So the app with the following feature. So the app should use the map webcam to analyze the should use the map webcam to analyze the should use the map webcam to analyze the objects the user is holding up. So for objects the user is holding up. So for objects the user is holding up. So for each object we're going to print the each object we're going to print the each object we're going to print the name of this object and put it in a list name of this object and put it in a list name of this object and put it in a list in the UI. When the list has three in the UI. When the list has three in the UI. When the list has three objects, uh we going to write uh use objects, uh we going to write uh use objects, uh we going to write uh use these three objects to write a short PO these three objects to write a short PO these three objects to write a short PO poem using claude opus 4. Uh then we poem using claude opus 4. Uh then we poem using claude opus 4. Uh then we will send this poem to the 11 labs API will send this poem to the 11 labs API will send this poem to the 11 labs API to read it out loud using a voice ID we to read it out loud using a voice ID we to read it out loud using a voice ID we have set here. So when the poem is have set here. So when the poem is have set here. So when the poem is ready, we're just going to play it in ready, we're just going to play it in ready, we're just going to play it in the app. So create this app in a the app. So create this app in a the app. So create this app in a framework you think is the best. Good framework you think is the best. Good framework you think is the best. Good luck. Uh I've set my API keys. So write luck. Uh I've set my API keys. So write luck. Uh I've set my API keys. So write app. So let's see if we can kind of app. So let's see if we can kind of app. So let's see if we can kind of oneshot this. I think we need to do some oneshot this. I think we need to do some oneshot this. I think we need to do some iterations. So basically uh we're going iterations. So basically uh we're going iterations. So basically uh we're going to use the webcam to hold up some to use the webcam to hold up some to use the webcam to hold up some objects. Use these objects to create a objects. Use these objects to create a objects. Use these objects to create a poem. So we need to use the vision. We poem. So we need to use the vision. We poem. So we need to use the vision. We need to use uh the webcam, right? We need to use uh the webcam, right? We need to use uh the webcam, right? We need to use 11 labs. Uh and I collected need to use 11 labs. Uh and I collected need to use 11 labs. Uh and I collected some documentation here with cloud some documentation here with cloud some documentation here with cloud vision cloud for the new API and 11 vision cloud for the new API and 11 vision cloud for the new API and 11 labs. And I put API keys here. Okay. So let's try it out here. We here. Okay. So let's try it out here. We here. Okay. So let's try it out here. We did this in just JavaScript with an did this in just JavaScript with an did this in just JavaScript with an index index index html. So we can just start this server. html. So we can just start this server. html. So we can just start this server. mpm start. We can go to local host. So I mpm start. We can go to local host. So I mpm start. We can go to local host. So I turned off my camera now. So let's see turned off my camera now. So let's see turned off my camera now. So let's see if we can connect. Click start camera to if we can connect. Click start camera to if we can connect. Click start camera to Perfect. So we need to capture objects. Perfect. So we need to capture objects. Perfect. So we need to capture objects. Okay. So let me see if I can find an Okay. So let me see if I can find an Okay. So let me see if I can find an object here. I have my coffee cup object here. I have my coffee cup object here. I have my coffee cup person. Okay. Let's try this cup. Okay, person. Okay. Let's try this cup. Okay, person. Okay. Let's try this cup. Okay, that worked. But am I using Let's try that worked. But am I using Let's try that worked. But am I using Let's try this headset. Sports ball. I don't think this headset. Sports ball. I don't think this headset. Sports ball. I don't think we are using Okay, so that worked. We we are using Okay, so that worked. We we are using Okay, so that worked. We created a poem and we have the That was created a poem and we have the That was created a poem and we have the That was pretty fast. Uh let's listen to this. pretty fast. Uh let's listen to this. pretty fast. Uh let's listen to this. But I think we need to use the anthropic But I think we need to use the anthropic But I think we need to use the anthropic vision model to because sports ball I vision model to because sports ball I vision model to because sports ball I didn't hop that. But let's try this didn't hop that. But let's try this didn't hop that. But let's try this simpler version first. With a cup in simpler version first. With a cup in simpler version first. With a cup in hand and a ball at their feet, the hand and a ball at their feet, the hand and a ball at their feet, the person juggled both with a rhythmic person juggled both with a rhythmic person juggled both with a rhythmic beat. The cup and ball danced in a beat. The cup and ball danced in a beat. The cup and ball danced in a playful light, a whimsical show, a playful light, a whimsical show, a playful light, a whimsical show, a joyful sight. Yeah, that was good, joyful sight. Yeah, that was good, joyful sight. Yeah, that was good, right? It was very fast. It must have right? It was very fast. It must have right? It was very fast. It must have been some asynchronous things here been some asynchronous things here been some asynchronous things here because the the audio came very fast. because the the audio came very fast. because the the audio came very fast. And I kind of like the UI. It's great. And I kind of like the UI. It's great. And I kind of like the UI. It's great. Uh, but let's try to change it up a bit Uh, but let's try to change it up a bit Uh, but let's try to change it up a bit here. So, let's do Great. It's working. here. So, let's do Great. It's working. here. So, let's do Great. It's working. Uh, but the way we ID objects is bad. Uh, but the way we ID objects is bad. Uh, but the way we ID objects is bad. Let's use the vision API from Claude. uh Let's use the vision API from Claude. uh Let's use the vision API from Claude. uh to ID the objects, take a screenshot, to ID the objects, take a screenshot, to ID the objects, take a screenshot, send it to the API, extract the object send it to the API, extract the object send it to the API, extract the object from the response and add it to the from the response and add it to the from the response and add it to the list. Please integrate. So, let's see if list. Please integrate. So, let's see if list. Please integrate. So, let's see if we can change this up because uh my we can change this up because uh my we can change this up because uh my headset was not a sports ball and I want headset was not a sports ball and I want headset was not a sports ball and I want to be precise with the objects we came to be precise with the objects we came to be precise with the objects we came up with. So, okay. So, we're using up with. So, okay. So, we're using up with. So, okay. So, we're using TensorFlow now. That's fine, but it's TensorFlow now. That's fine, but it's TensorFlow now. That's fine, but it's not u not precise enough. So, I'm going not u not precise enough. So, I'm going not u not precise enough. So, I'm going to find a few other objects and I'll be to find a few other objects and I'll be to find a few other objects and I'll be back when we hopefully have this set up. back when we hopefully have this set up. back when we hopefully have this set up. Okay, so that was pretty fast. Uh, I'm Okay, so that was pretty fast. Uh, I'm Okay, so that was pretty fast. Uh, I'm going to restart the server and let's going to restart the server and let's going to restart the server and let's try it again. Okay, so let's see now. try it again. Okay, so let's see now. try it again. Okay, so let's see now. So, I have this uh iPhone here. Let's So, I have this uh iPhone here. Let's So, I have this uh iPhone here. Let's try try try that. Okay, so we got the iPhone. That that. Okay, so we got the iPhone. That that. Okay, so we got the iPhone. That was pretty quick. Uh, let's try this ruler. Measuring tape. Yeah, I guess ruler. Measuring tape. Yeah, I guess ruler. Measuring tape. Yeah, I guess that's fine. Uh, I had a third object that's fine. Uh, I had a third object that's fine. Uh, I had a third object here. Where did it here. Where did it here. Where did it go? Let's just try this one. VR one. VR one. VR headset. Okay, whatever. Let's Let's headset. Okay, whatever. Let's Let's headset. Okay, whatever. Let's Let's listen to this one. With iPhone in hand listen to this one. With iPhone in hand listen to this one. With iPhone in hand and measuring tape unfurled, I stepped and measuring tape unfurled, I stepped and measuring tape unfurled, I stepped into a world where reality swirled. The into a world where reality swirled. The into a world where reality swirled. The VR headset took me to places unknown, VR headset took me to places unknown, VR headset took me to places unknown, where pixels danced and imagination where pixels danced and imagination where pixels danced and imagination shown. Yeah, this is working. So, I'm shown. Yeah, this is working. So, I'm shown. Yeah, this is working. So, I'm pretty impressed. This was uh zero shot pretty impressed. This was uh zero shot pretty impressed. This was uh zero shot with the addition we created to actually with the addition we created to actually with the addition we created to actually add the the new uh improved add the the new uh improved add the the new uh improved um ID. Uh I want to try it one more um ID. Uh I want to try it one more um ID. Uh I want to try it one more time. So, let's reset this. I want to time. So, let's reset this. I want to time. So, let's reset this. I want to see if it can read uh the text here. Yeah, that's a protein bar for here. Yeah, that's a protein bar for here. Yeah, that's a protein bar for sure. sure. sure. Let's try this Bose headset. Bose headphones. headset. Bose headphones. headset. Bose headphones. Perfect. And let's try the Nvidia coffee cup. Coffee mug. Wow, that was good. cup. Coffee mug. Wow, that was good. cup. Coffee mug. Wow, that was good. This is a cool app, right? Let's listen This is a cool app, right? Let's listen This is a cool app, right? Let's listen to it. Bose headphones on. World tuned to it. Bose headphones on. World tuned to it. Bose headphones on. World tuned out. Sipping from my trusty coffee out. Sipping from my trusty coffee out. Sipping from my trusty coffee spout. A protein bar. My midday treat. spout. A protein bar. My midday treat. spout. A protein bar. My midday treat. Fueling whimsy. Making life sweet. Yeah, Fueling whimsy. Making life sweet. Yeah, Fueling whimsy. Making life sweet. Yeah, I'm super happy with this. This looks I'm super happy with this. This looks I'm super happy with this. This looks perfect, right? So, pretty impressed. perfect, right? So, pretty impressed. perfect, right? So, pretty impressed. Uh, this is a nice app. I really enjoy Uh, this is a nice app. I really enjoy Uh, this is a nice app. I really enjoy it. It's pretty fun. Uh, but let's uh it. It's pretty fun. Uh, but let's uh it. It's pretty fun. Uh, but let's uh let me see if it can capture if I do let me see if it can capture if I do let me see if it can capture if I do some hand gestures. Uh, let's move on. some hand gestures. Uh, let's move on. some hand gestures. Uh, let's move on. Uh, I want to show you how the MCP Uh, I want to show you how the MCP Uh, I want to show you how the MCP connector works and how we can do the connector works and how we can do the connector works and how we can do the MCP servers now in the API. Okay, so if MCP servers now in the API. Okay, so if MCP servers now in the API. Okay, so if you look at the documentation here, this you look at the documentation here, this you look at the documentation here, this is pretty easy to set up, but uh of is pretty easy to set up, but uh of is pretty easy to set up, but uh of course we need a URL like an SSC URL. So course we need a URL like an SSC URL. So course we need a URL like an SSC URL. So if you look at mcpservers. org here, we if you look at mcpservers. org here, we if you look at mcpservers. org here, we have this sequential thinking and here have this sequential thinking and here have this sequential thinking and here we kind of have the URL we can use, we kind of have the URL we can use, we kind of have the URL we can use, right? Uh remote mcp server sequential right? Uh remote mcp server sequential right? Uh remote mcp server sequential thinking. So this is like a yeah thinking. So this is like a yeah thinking. So this is like a yeah step-by-step step-by-step step-by-step uh chain of thought uh MCP server we can uh chain of thought uh MCP server we can uh chain of thought uh MCP server we can use. So you can see here we just set up use. So you can see here we just set up use. So you can see here we just set up our MCP server down here. This is a open our MCP server down here. This is a open our MCP server down here. This is a open one. So we don't need a token or an API one. So we don't need a token or an API one. So we don't need a token or an API key. We just feed in key. We just feed in key. We just feed in the the kind of our question here. And the the kind of our question here. And the the kind of our question here. And this should pick up an MCP tool if it's this should pick up an MCP tool if it's this should pick up an MCP tool if it's uh something we want to use here. So let uh something we want to use here. So let uh something we want to use here. So let me show you the setup I created for me show you the setup I created for me show you the setup I created for this. You can see here is my Python this. You can see here is my Python this. You can see here is my Python code. We are using cloud for sonat. We code. We are using cloud for sonat. We code. We are using cloud for sonat. We set the tokens. uh my message is going set the tokens. uh my message is going set the tokens. uh my message is going to be what is 44 * 11 / 3 * 55 use to be what is 44 * 11 / 3 * 55 use to be what is 44 * 11 / 3 * 55 use sequential thinking and for MCP servers sequential thinking and for MCP servers sequential thinking and for MCP servers in the API call we have set up this uh in the API call we have set up this uh in the API call we have set up this uh sequential thinking MCP we named it sequential thinking MCP we named it sequential thinking MCP we named it sequential thinking and we use the MCP sequential thinking and we use the MCP sequential thinking and we use the MCP client beta setup here and yeah that is client beta setup here and yeah that is client beta setup here and yeah that is basically it yeah we have some setup and basically it yeah we have some setup and basically it yeah we have some setup and some fallback here but basically that is some fallback here but basically that is some fallback here but basically that is all we need so if we run if we clear all we need so if we run if we clear all we need so if we run if we clear this this this now we run Python simple sequential now we run Python simple sequential now we run Python simple sequential thinking so what's going to happen now thinking so what's going to happen now thinking so what's going to happen now as you can see we are testing this uh as you can see we are testing this uh as you can see we are testing this uh asking claw to use the sequential asking claw to use the sequential asking claw to use the sequential thinking tool for complex decision thinking tool for complex decision thinking tool for complex decision making uh and this is the server we are making uh and this is the server we are making uh and this is the server we are connected to right this is going to take connected to right this is going to take connected to right this is going to take some time but uh hopefully we will get some time but uh hopefully we will get some time but uh hopefully we will get like a step-by-step sequential thinking like a step-by-step sequential thinking like a step-by-step sequential thinking of solving our math question here so I'm of solving our math question here so I'm of solving our math question here so I'm just going I'm going to let this run and just going I'm going to let this run and just going I'm going to let this run and I'll take you back when we have the I'll take you back when we have the I'll take you back when we have the response. Okay, perfect. So now you can response. Okay, perfect. So now you can response. Okay, perfect. So now you can see uh we have the tokens here. We have see uh we have the tokens here. We have see uh we have the tokens here. We have some input tokens. We have some output some input tokens. We have some output some input tokens. We have some output tokens and if you scroll up here now you tokens and if you scroll up here now you tokens and if you scroll up here now you can see uh cloud response using the can see uh cloud response using the can see uh cloud response using the thinking MCP server tool MCP server tool thinking MCP server tool MCP server tool thinking MCP server tool MCP server tool use. You can see we said we see the use. You can see we said we see the use. You can see we said we see the input the tool result and if you look at input the tool result and if you look at input the tool result and if you look at the end here is how I solve this step by the end here is how I solve this step by the end here is how I solve this step by step following the order of operation. step following the order of operation. step following the order of operation. PMDAS bombdas bodm mass I perform PMDAS bombdas bodm mass I perform PMDAS bombdas bodm mass I perform multiplication division from right to multiplication division from right to multiplication division from right to left we did this we ended up with 83 left we did this we ended up with 83 left we did this we ended up with 83 883 and 1/3 so let's double check that 883 and 1/3 so let's double check that 883 and 1/3 so let's double check that and if we run it here you can see we get and if we run it here you can see we get and if we run it here you can see we get the same 88 uh 83 1/3 perfect so you can the same 88 uh 83 1/3 perfect so you can the same 88 uh 83 1/3 perfect so you can see by using this uh I guess we would see by using this uh I guess we would see by using this uh I guess we would have solved this anyway but uh have solved this anyway but uh have solved this anyway but uh sequential thinking here uh could be sequential thinking here uh could be sequential thinking here uh could be pretty cool if to use like a lesser pretty cool if to use like a lesser pretty cool if to use like a lesser model. But we came to the right model. But we came to the right model. But we came to the right conclusion or the right results. That conclusion or the right results. That conclusion or the right results. That was pretty cool. So using this MCB was pretty cool. So using this MCB was pretty cool. So using this MCB connector is uh fairly easy to set up. connector is uh fairly easy to set up. connector is uh fairly easy to set up. The only thing is that uh now you kind The only thing is that uh now you kind The only thing is that uh now you kind of need to use more of need to use more of need to use more uh third party hosted servers because uh uh third party hosted servers because uh uh third party hosted servers because uh I don't know you can probably run this I don't know you can probably run this I don't know you can probably run this uh locally with your own but if we're uh locally with your own but if we're uh locally with your own but if we're going to use Sentry for example we need going to use Sentry for example we need going to use Sentry for example we need to have an token here an O token to to have an token here an O token to to have an token here an O token to connect deep week is open we have some connect deep week is open we have some connect deep week is open we have some more open ones here uh we have fetch so more open ones here uh we have fetch so more open ones here uh we have fetch so let's say if we switch to fetch now we let's say if we switch to fetch now we let's say if we switch to fetch now we can probably just copy this address and can probably just copy this address and can probably just copy this address and go into our code here. And we can go into our code here. And we can go into our code here. And we can probably just swap out the MCP server probably just swap out the MCP server probably just swap out the MCP server here, right? here, right? here, right? Okay. Give it a new name. Fetch. Yes. Okay. Give it a new name. Fetch. Yes. Okay. Give it a new name. Fetch. Yes. And change up this. Give And change up this. Give And change up this. Give me give me the content of me give me the content of me give me the content of the URL. Let's grab the model MCP the URL. Let's grab the model MCP the URL. Let's grab the model MCP connector documentation. Paste it in. connector documentation. Paste it in. connector documentation. Paste it in. And let's try to run this now, right? And let's try to run this now, right? And let's try to run this now, right? Let's change the print statement to use Let's change the print statement to use Let's change the print statement to use the fetch server. Okay, let's accept the fetch server. Okay, let's accept the fetch server. Okay, let's accept that. And now when we run this, probably that. And now when we run this, probably that. And now when we run this, probably need to save it. We should probably see need to save it. We should probably see need to save it. We should probably see uh fetch MCP integration. Yes, we are uh fetch MCP integration. Yes, we are uh fetch MCP integration. Yes, we are using that adding code to fetch content using that adding code to fetch content using that adding code to fetch content from the URL. Let's see if it works. from the URL. Let's see if it works. from the URL. Let's see if it works. Okay, so let's see. Uh yeah, this looks Okay, so let's see. Uh yeah, this looks Okay, so let's see. Uh yeah, this looks pretty good. We fetched everything here pretty good. We fetched everything here pretty good. We fetched everything here about MCP connector. We got a nice about MCP connector. We got a nice about MCP connector. We got a nice format. Perfect. So you can see how easy format. Perfect. So you can see how easy format. Perfect. So you can see how easy it is to set up these MCP servers in it is to set up these MCP servers in it is to set up these MCP servers in your API. Now you can see using fetch your API. Now you can see using fetch your API. Now you can see using fetch MCP server. Uh we got everything. MCP server. Uh we got everything. MCP server. Uh we got everything. Perfect. So yeah, that is pretty Perfect. So yeah, that is pretty Perfect. So yeah, that is pretty interesting. That's definitely something interesting. That's definitely something interesting. That's definitely something we're going to take advantage of when we we're going to take advantage of when we we're going to take advantage of when we are creating some cool workflows using are creating some cool workflows using are creating some cool workflows using this. So a very neat integration again this. So a very neat integration again this. So a very neat integration again by Antropic. I kind of like using this by Antropic. I kind of like using this by Antropic. I kind of like using this MCP service in our API. And like you MCP service in our API. And like you MCP service in our API. And like you saw, super easy to switch, super easy to saw, super easy to switch, super easy to saw, super easy to switch, super easy to add new MCP servers in the API here. Uh, add new MCP servers in the API here. Uh, add new MCP servers in the API here. Uh, is there anything else I want to cover is there anything else I want to cover is there anything else I want to cover in kind of my first impression? I think in kind of my first impression? I think in kind of my first impression? I think I'm pretty happy. Uh, also, uh, just a I'm pretty happy. Uh, also, uh, just a I'm pretty happy. Uh, also, uh, just a heads up, uh, cursor also has added Claw heads up, uh, cursor also has added Claw heads up, uh, cursor also has added Claw for Sur Cloud Force on it. So, I've been for Sur Cloud Force on it. So, I've been for Sur Cloud Force on it. So, I've been testing it out today, just uh making testing it out today, just uh making testing it out today, just uh making some changes, and it looks pretty good some changes, and it looks pretty good some changes, and it looks pretty good to be honest, and I'm really looking to be honest, and I'm really looking to be honest, and I'm really looking forward to trying out over this weekend. forward to trying out over this weekend. forward to trying out over this weekend. And we have more of an ID. But my first And we have more of an ID. But my first And we have more of an ID. But my first impression is as cloud 37 as Gemini 2. 5. impression is as cloud 37 as Gemini 2. 5. impression is as cloud 37 as Gemini 2. 5. Yeah, just works. That's the way I want Yeah, just works. That's the way I want Yeah, just works. That's the way I want it. And it's going to be interesting to it. And it's going to be interesting to it. And it's going to be interesting to see what else we can do using Cloud see what else we can do using Cloud see what else we can do using Cloud Code. And yeah, looking forward to what Code. And yeah, looking forward to what Code. And yeah, looking forward to what uh other people are doing. Maybe you can uh other people are doing. Maybe you can uh other people are doing. Maybe you can take some inspiration for an upcoming take some inspiration for an upcoming take some inspiration for an upcoming videos this weekend. So, hope you videos this weekend. So, hope you videos this weekend. So, hope you enjoyed this quick uh introduction to enjoyed this quick uh introduction to enjoyed this quick uh introduction to Claude 4, Cloud Code, and the new uh Claude 4, Cloud Code, and the new uh Claude 4, Cloud Code, and the new uh cloud execution tool and MCP in the API. cloud execution tool and MCP in the API. cloud execution tool and MCP in the API. And I'll see you probably again tomorrow And I'll see you probably again tomorrow And I'll see you probably again tomorrow with some other tests around this. So, with some other tests around this.
