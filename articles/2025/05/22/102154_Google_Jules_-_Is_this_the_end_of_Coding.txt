Description:
好的，以下是根据提供的文本提炼的核心思想摘要、核心观点、总体框架和概念图。

**核心思想摘要**

1.  **Google Jewels 的定位与功能：** Google Jewels 是一个新推出的异步编码代理，由 Google 开发，旨在自动化软件开发中的代码修改任务。
2.  **工作流程：** 它能够与代码仓库（如 GitHub）集成，根据用户提供的任务/提示，在一个按需创建的虚拟沙箱环境中克隆并分析代码。
3.  **自动化操作：** Jewels 通过运行一系列代理在沙箱内执行代码修改、重构、运行测试等操作，并将结果以代码差异和建议的形式展示。
4.  **交付物：** 最终，Jewels 会自动创建一个包含所有修改的新分支，并在连接的代码仓库中生成拉取请求（Pull Request），供开发者评审。
5.  **与其他工具的比较：** 它被认为是 GitHub Copilot 编码代理的竞争者或补充，也可看作 Cursor IDE 的云端实现。
6.  **协同工作：** 在拉取请求生成后，其他工具（如 Amazon Q Developer）可以自动介入，进行代码评审、安全漏洞检查，甚至提供代码修复建议。
7.  **对开发者的影响：** Jewels 与其他 AI 工具的结合使得开发者能够在几乎不手动编写代码的情况下完成复杂的开发、重构和质量改进任务。

**核心观点**

Google Jewels 等AI编码代理正通过自动化核心开发任务，显著改变软件开发的面貌。

**总体框架**

基于人工智能代理的自动化与增强型软件开发工作流。

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en Hi guys, welcome back and today in this Hi guys, welcome back and today in this Hi guys, welcome back and today in this video we're going to talk about yet video we're going to talk about yet video we're going to talk about yet another coding agent but this is an another coding agent but this is an another coding agent but this is an asynchronous coding agent and they call asynchronous coding agent and they call asynchronous coding agent and they call it as uh jewels. So jewels is from it as uh jewels. So jewels is from it as uh jewels. So jewels is from Google and it is going to change the Google and it is going to change the Google and it is going to change the landscape of coding bit further. So the landscape of coding bit further. So the landscape of coding bit further. So the way they the the the jewels really work way they the the the jewels really work way they the the the jewels really work is that it is going to obtain the access is that it is going to obtain the access is that it is going to obtain the access of your repository like GitHub of your repository like GitHub of your repository like GitHub repository and then it is going to uh repository and then it is going to uh repository and then it is going to uh let you give some tasks to it and based let you give some tasks to it and based let you give some tasks to it and based on the task that you give it is going to on the task that you give it is going to on the task that you give it is going to go and modify the code in the repository go and modify the code in the repository go and modify the code in the repository by running a series of agents and then by running a series of agents and then by running a series of agents and then it is going to give the result for you it is going to give the result for you it is going to give the result for you to review and once uh it reviews and it to review and once uh it reviews and it to review and once uh it reviews and it once it is happy like once you are happy once it is happy like once you are happy once it is happy like once you are happy with the you uh of the code and then you with the you uh of the code and then you with the you uh of the code and then you can merge the code into the repository can merge the code into the repository can merge the code into the repository and then you get the new feature. So and then you get the new feature. So and then you get the new feature. So everything is going to work inside the everything is going to work inside the everything is going to work inside the jewels using a virtual sandbox machine jewels using a virtual sandbox machine jewels using a virtual sandbox machine which is going to be created every which is going to be created every which is going to be created every single time while you are going to ask single time while you are going to ask single time while you are going to ask Juul to do those tasks. So this is Juul to do those tasks. So this is Juul to do those tasks. So this is pretty much exactly the same kind of pretty much exactly the same kind of pretty much exactly the same kind of tool which was introduced by GitHub tool which was introduced by GitHub tool which was introduced by GitHub copilot's coding agent uh yesterday in copilot's coding agent uh yesterday in copilot's coding agent uh yesterday in uh in the GitHub copilot uh meet and uh in the GitHub copilot uh meet and uh in the GitHub copilot uh meet and also this is pretty much like an uh like also this is pretty much like an uh like also this is pretty much like an uh like a cloud version of the cursor IDE if you a cloud version of the cursor IDE if you a cloud version of the cursor IDE if you just want to put it that way. So Jules just want to put it that way. So Jules just want to put it that way. So Jules again uh there is no waiting list or again uh there is no waiting list or again uh there is no waiting list or anything like that. It was just anything like that. It was just anything like that. It was just introduced today uh in the Google IO introduced today uh in the Google IO introduced today uh in the Google IO meet. So you can see this is what is the meet. So you can see this is what is the meet. So you can see this is what is the Google jewels uh you can do the GitHub Google jewels uh you can do the GitHub Google jewels uh you can do the GitHub integration. It creates a virtual integration. It creates a virtual integration. It creates a virtual machine. I was just talking about like machine. I was just talking about like machine. I was just talking about like it is going to create uh uh a virtual it is going to create uh uh a virtual it is going to create uh uh a virtual machine sandbox on the cloud and it's machine sandbox on the cloud and it's machine sandbox on the cloud and it's going to clone your code and then it's going to clone your code and then it's going to clone your code and then it's going to verify all the change and then going to verify all the change and then going to verify all the change and then it is going to suggest new changes based it is going to suggest new changes based it is going to suggest new changes based on the prompt that you're going to be on the prompt that you're going to be on the prompt that you're going to be giving in and it also going to run the giving in and it also going to run the giving in and it also going to run the test uh for you on this particular test uh for you on this particular test uh for you on this particular jewels which is going to be pretty jewels which is going to be pretty jewels which is going to be pretty amazing. Basically you can run uh the amazing. Basically you can run uh the amazing. Basically you can run uh the existing tests or you can create a new existing tests or you can create a new existing tests or you can create a new tests on the tools using this particular tests on the tools using this particular tests on the tools using this particular uh virtual machine uh that you have uh virtual machine uh that you have uh virtual machine uh that you have cloned your code repository in and also cloned your code repository in and also cloned your code repository in and also it's going to show you all the it's going to show you all the it's going to show you all the difference and things which is going to difference and things which is going to difference and things which is going to be pretty amazing once you see that be pretty amazing once you see that be pretty amazing once you see that really works and this is what they have really works and this is what they have really works and this is what they have shown over here and I have a working shown over here and I have a working shown over here and I have a working version of the jewels I can quickly show version of the jewels I can quickly show version of the jewels I can quickly show you uh how it looks like so this is the you uh how it looks like so this is the you uh how it looks like so this is the um the jewels. google google. com page um the jewels. google google. com page um the jewels. google google. com page like this is the documentation we have like this is the documentation we have like this is the documentation we have got but if you just go to jewels. google got but if you just go to jewels. google got but if you just go to jewels. google Google over here try uh jewels I have Google over here try uh jewels I have Google over here try uh jewels I have already signed in that's the reason why already signed in that's the reason why already signed in that's the reason why I'm going to be taken uh over here I'm going to be taken uh over here I'm going to be taken uh over here directly and I asked a very very super directly and I asked a very very super directly and I asked a very very super simple question and because of the the simple question and because of the the simple question and because of the the traffic uh in the jewel right now I traffic uh in the jewel right now I traffic uh in the jewel right now I couldn't able to even perform a simple couldn't able to even perform a simple couldn't able to even perform a simple operation so I asked uh you know just operation so I asked uh you know just operation so I asked uh you know just help me fix the pipeline and run the help me fix the pipeline and run the help me fix the pipeline and run the test for this playright CI/CD uh test for this playright CI/CD uh test for this playright CI/CD uh repository it couldn't able to do it repository it couldn't able to do it repository it couldn't able to do it because of the high traffic but the way because of the high traffic but the way because of the high traffic but the way you actually work with this jewel is you actually work with this jewel is you actually work with this jewel is that you see that I have authorized my that you see that I have authorized my that you see that I have authorized my GitHub repository with the jewel. It's GitHub repository with the jewel. It's GitHub repository with the jewel. It's like connectivity that you do and then like connectivity that you do and then like connectivity that you do and then it's going to show me all the repository it's going to show me all the repository it's going to show me all the repository that I have got including my private that I have got including my private that I have got including my private repositories and public repository. repositories and public repository. repositories and public repository. Everything is going to be shown over Everything is going to be shown over Everything is going to be shown over here. That is the level of access that I here. That is the level of access that I here. That is the level of access that I have given to it. Uh and then you can have given to it. Uh and then you can have given to it. Uh and then you can choose any of the repository. For choose any of the repository. For choose any of the repository. For instance, I'm going to choose uh let's instance, I'm going to choose uh let's instance, I'm going to choose uh let's say the selenium grid docker over here. say the selenium grid docker over here. say the selenium grid docker over here. This is the main branch that I'm going This is the main branch that I'm going This is the main branch that I'm going to choose. And I'm going to say can you to choose. And I'm going to say can you to choose. And I'm going to say can you uh uh uh analyze the code and give me some analyze the code and give me some analyze the code and give me some suggestions something like that. And if suggestions something like that. And if suggestions something like that. And if I just hit get me the plan it is going I just hit get me the plan it is going I just hit get me the plan it is going to suggest the plan by spinning up a to suggest the plan by spinning up a to suggest the plan by spinning up a virtual machine. You see that it is virtual machine. You see that it is virtual machine. You see that it is saying that booting up the VM for you saying that booting up the VM for you saying that booting up the VM for you over here. So it's going to spin up a over here. So it's going to spin up a over here. So it's going to spin up a virtual machine. It's going to uh do a virtual machine. It's going to uh do a virtual machine. It's going to uh do a get check out of the code from the get check out of the code from the get check out of the code from the particular repository and then it is particular repository and then it is particular repository and then it is going to uh do the analysis uh and then going to uh do the analysis uh and then going to uh do the analysis uh and then it is going to give the code suggestion it is going to give the code suggestion it is going to give the code suggestion that I have asked really you see that that I have asked really you see that that I have asked really you see that now it is doing the cloning of the exit now it is doing the cloning of the exit now it is doing the cloning of the exit automation senium git docker over here automation senium git docker over here automation senium git docker over here uh which is amazing so something is uh uh which is amazing so something is uh uh which is amazing so something is uh really happening there so let's wait for really happening there so let's wait for really happening there so let's wait for uh the execution to happen but I have uh the execution to happen but I have uh the execution to happen but I have seen so far uh based on my uh test this seen so far uh based on my uh test this seen so far uh based on my uh test this uh entire operation has never happened uh entire operation has never happened uh entire operation has never happened because of the high load uh which the because of the high load uh which the because of the high load uh which the Google jewel is currently going through. Google jewel is currently going through. Google jewel is currently going through. But you see that there is a daily limit But you see that there is a daily limit But you see that there is a daily limit of five for me and I have already used of five for me and I have already used of five for me and I have already used three of them. But uh let's wait for three of them. But uh let's wait for three of them. But uh let's wait for what is really going to happen uh in what is really going to happen uh in what is really going to happen uh in this particular uh codebase. See that it this particular uh codebase. See that it this particular uh codebase. See that it has got the uh code. It is now reading has got the uh code. It is now reading has got the uh code. It is now reading the pom. xml file. Uh let's see what is the pom. xml file. Uh let's see what is the pom. xml file. Uh let's see what is the the actual suggestion the Google the the actual suggestion the Google the the actual suggestion the Google jewel is going to give to us. Oh, look jewel is going to give to us. Oh, look jewel is going to give to us. Oh, look at that. Now it's reading the Selenium at that. Now it's reading the Selenium at that. Now it's reading the Selenium uh demo mainpace test on Java which is uh demo mainpace test on Java which is uh demo mainpace test on Java which is amazing. So it's uh iterating through amazing. So it's uh iterating through amazing. So it's uh iterating through all the uh test files and in the all the uh test files and in the all the uh test files and in the meantime because this is an asynchronous meantime because this is an asynchronous meantime because this is an asynchronous coding agent uh it can do things coding agent uh it can do things coding agent uh it can do things asynchronously which is amazing. So if I asynchronously which is amazing. So if I asynchronously which is amazing. So if I just go and see what is really happening just go and see what is really happening just go and see what is really happening to my other things. Uh well this there to my other things. Uh well this there to my other things. Uh well this there is no luck on there. Uh this is still is no luck on there. Uh this is still is no luck on there. Uh this is still starting shortly but at least uh this starting shortly but at least uh this starting shortly but at least uh this guy is doing something there. So we guy is doing something there. So we guy is doing something there. So we should see some kind of results. So just should see some kind of results. So just should see some kind of results. So just let's wait for some time before I let's wait for some time before I let's wait for some time before I actually get the result. There we go. As actually get the result. There we go. As actually get the result. There we go. As you can see that we have got some review you can see that we have got some review you can see that we have got some review over here. So it's uh it's going to tell over here. So it's uh it's going to tell over here. So it's uh it's going to tell me that these are the code that it has me that these are the code that it has me that these are the code that it has analyzed. So it it feels like these are analyzed. So it it feels like these are analyzed. So it it feels like these are the changes that we can do. It says that the changes that we can do. It says that the changes that we can do. It says that review the main uh page test to Java review the main uh page test to Java review the main uh page test to Java which is this one. Uh and it says that which is this one. Uh and it says that which is this one. Uh and it says that refactoring uh this will uh with refactoring uh this will uh with refactoring uh this will uh with encapsulation of the web elements to encapsulation of the web elements to encapsulation of the web elements to provide action method. So that's what it provide action method. So that's what it provide action method. So that's what it is doing over here. And this is also is doing over here. And this is also is doing over here. And this is also saying that the externalization of the saying that the externalization of the saying that the externalization of the hard-coded URL which is currently like hard-coded URL which is currently like hard-coded URL which is currently like uh within this particular uh file. So uh within this particular uh file. So uh within this particular uh file. So it's saying that we need to externalize it's saying that we need to externalize it's saying that we need to externalize that and it is saying all the plan is that and it is saying all the plan is that and it is saying all the plan is being approved. And you see that once being approved. And you see that once being approved. And you see that once the plan is approved like once I say the plan is approved like once I say the plan is approved like once I say it's okay then you will see that now it it's okay then you will see that now it it's okay then you will see that now it is trying to work on fixing that is trying to work on fixing that is trying to work on fixing that particular code. So pretty much like the particular code. So pretty much like the particular code. So pretty much like the ask part of the cursor IDE uh and then ask part of the cursor IDE uh and then ask part of the cursor IDE uh and then the agent part that you do uh that's the agent part that you do uh that's the agent part that you do uh that's what really is happening over here. See what really is happening over here. See what really is happening over here. See that this is how things are going to that this is how things are going to that this is how things are going to work uh with the jewels uh over here. work uh with the jewels uh over here. work uh with the jewels uh over here. All right. So now I have waited a few All right. So now I have waited a few All right. So now I have waited a few more minutes to get this point over here more minutes to get this point over here more minutes to get this point over here that see that the code has been that see that the code has been that see that the code has been completely uh written for us over here completely uh written for us over here completely uh written for us over here based on the analysis that the jewels based on the analysis that the jewels based on the analysis that the jewels has done for us. Uh and it has given me has done for us. Uh and it has given me has done for us. Uh and it has given me these details. So it has reviewed the these details. So it has reviewed the these details. So it has reviewed the main page test 2 on Java confirmed. It main page test 2 on Java confirmed. It main page test 2 on Java confirmed. It also requires refactoring for the page also requires refactoring for the page also requires refactoring for the page object model principles and assertions. object model principles and assertions. object model principles and assertions. It knows that we have to follow the It knows that we have to follow the It knows that we have to follow the principles of the POM and assertions. So principles of the POM and assertions. So principles of the POM and assertions. So it is confirmed that there needs a it is confirmed that there needs a it is confirmed that there needs a refactoring. So it has done that for us refactoring. So it has done that for us refactoring. So it has done that for us over here. So if I just go to the main over here. So if I just go to the main over here. So if I just go to the main page test two uh which is this one. You page test two uh which is this one. You page test two uh which is this one. You see that now the code has been changed see that now the code has been changed see that now the code has been changed and there is some assertion happened and there is some assertion happened and there is some assertion happened over here. So that change has been shown over here. So that change has been shown over here. So that change has been shown over here. there is a change in over here. there is a change in over here. there is a change in assertion happened which is quite assertion happened which is quite assertion happened which is quite amazing. So it has done that for me over amazing. So it has done that for me over amazing. So it has done that for me over there and you see that it's all in the there and you see that it's all in the there and you see that it's all in the change uh log kind of thing because now change uh log kind of thing because now change uh log kind of thing because now these codes are going to be checked in these codes are going to be checked in these codes are going to be checked in into the GitHub as a branch for us. I into the GitHub as a branch for us. I into the GitHub as a branch for us. I will show you quickly how it looks like. will show you quickly how it looks like. will show you quickly how it looks like. And similarly, it has analyzed the uh And similarly, it has analyzed the uh And similarly, it has analyzed the uh the main page test uh on Java as well. the main page test uh on Java as well. the main page test uh on Java as well. And you see that now it has encapsulated And you see that now it has encapsulated And you see that now it has encapsulated it which is quite amazing. And it has it which is quite amazing. And it has it which is quite amazing. And it has also gone through the code uh to see also gone through the code uh to see also gone through the code uh to see what are the other assertions and what are the other assertions and what are the other assertions and changes that it can do. You see that how changes that it can do. You see that how changes that it can do. You see that how many changes that it has did many changes that it has did many changes that it has did asynchronously without me doing asynchronously without me doing asynchronously without me doing anything. Now it has also refactored the anything. Now it has also refactored the anything. Now it has also refactored the code in such a way that it needs some code in such a way that it needs some code in such a way that it needs some property to be added uh uh for the code property to be added uh uh for the code property to be added uh uh for the code and for all the tools page it has added and for all the tools page it has added and for all the tools page it has added another page object model code itself um another page object model code itself um another page object model code itself um to follow the principles and then it has to follow the principles and then it has to follow the principles and then it has added it for me uh and it has added added it for me uh and it has added added it for me uh and it has added another page for search result page Java another page for search result page Java another page for search result page Java and it has keep on doing things for me and it has keep on doing things for me and it has keep on doing things for me and you see that it has also created a and you see that it has also created a and you see that it has also created a config. properties properties file config. properties properties file config. properties properties file externalizing the um the URL for me and externalizing the um the URL for me and externalizing the um the URL for me and that's been added as well and now that's been added as well and now that's been added as well and now everything is created and it has also everything is created and it has also everything is created and it has also created an a branch for me to review created an a branch for me to review created an a branch for me to review over here look at that like it has over here look at that like it has over here look at that like it has created all of them now if I just created all of them now if I just created all of them now if I just publish this particular branch you will publish this particular branch you will publish this particular branch you will notice that this branch is going to be notice that this branch is going to be notice that this branch is going to be published for me in my GitHub repository published for me in my GitHub repository published for me in my GitHub repository so now if I go and hit this view the uh so now if I go and hit this view the uh so now if I go and hit this view the uh branch look at that now there is this branch look at that now there is this branch look at that now there is this particular uh branch in my exot particular uh branch in my exot particular uh branch in my exot automation GitHub repository. I can now automation GitHub repository. I can now automation GitHub repository. I can now compare and create a pull request. I can compare and create a pull request. I can compare and create a pull request. I can create a pull request. See, I have done create a pull request. See, I have done create a pull request. See, I have done nothing over here. And the pull request nothing over here. And the pull request nothing over here. And the pull request is now being added for me there. And is now being added for me there. And is now being added for me there. And there is going to be one more amazing there is going to be one more amazing there is going to be one more amazing thing which is going to happen because I thing which is going to happen because I thing which is going to happen because I have also configured the Amazon Q have also configured the Amazon Q have also configured the Amazon Q developer along with my uh repositories developer along with my uh repositories developer along with my uh repositories over there. You see that now the Amazon over there. You see that now the Amazon over there. You see that now the Amazon Q developer is automatically kicking in Q developer is automatically kicking in Q developer is automatically kicking in which is another video that I have which is another video that I have which is another video that I have covered about the Amazon Q for the CLI. covered about the Amazon Q for the CLI. covered about the Amazon Q for the CLI. If you have not really watched it, If you have not really watched it, If you have not really watched it, please go ahead and watch there. Uh it please go ahead and watch there. Uh it please go ahead and watch there. Uh it is also amazing because now you see that is also amazing because now you see that is also amazing because now you see that this guy is going to help me to start this guy is going to help me to start this guy is going to help me to start doing some security vulnerabilities in doing some security vulnerabilities in doing some security vulnerabilities in my code and also it is going to provide my code and also it is going to provide my code and also it is going to provide me some suggestion if there needs any me some suggestion if there needs any me some suggestion if there needs any improvements as well. U so look at that. improvements as well. U so look at that. improvements as well. U so look at that. Uh in the meantime while this Amazon Q Uh in the meantime while this Amazon Q Uh in the meantime while this Amazon Q is doing it for me I can see all the is doing it for me I can see all the is doing it for me I can see all the changes is going to be coming up for me changes is going to be coming up for me changes is going to be coming up for me over there. Every single bits of code is over there. Every single bits of code is over there. Every single bits of code is written by the jewels for me and you see written by the jewels for me and you see written by the jewels for me and you see that how things are happening. Now I'm that how things are happening. Now I'm that how things are happening. Now I'm not even writing a single line of code. not even writing a single line of code. not even writing a single line of code. Every prompt that we have got over there Every prompt that we have got over there Every prompt that we have got over there is doing it for me. Uh and in the is doing it for me. Uh and in the is doing it for me. Uh and in the meantime this Amazon Q developer is also meantime this Amazon Q developer is also meantime this Amazon Q developer is also going to do uh the code review for me going to do uh the code review for me going to do uh the code review for me and it's going to give the suggestions. and it's going to give the suggestions. and it's going to give the suggestions. Look at that. It's giving me the Look at that. It's giving me the Look at that. It's giving me the suggestion that this things uh can be uh suggestion that this things uh can be uh suggestion that this things uh can be uh there is a static initializer block for there is a static initializer block for there is a static initializer block for for that. So it's going to throw for that. So it's going to throw for that. So it's going to throw unchecked exceptions which can lead to unchecked exceptions which can lead to unchecked exceptions which can lead to unexpected program termination. Consider unexpected program termination. Consider unexpected program termination. Consider handling exception gracefully uh and do handling exception gracefully uh and do handling exception gracefully uh and do things. Guess what? This uh suggestions things. Guess what? This uh suggestions things. Guess what? This uh suggestions will also be improved and this um this will also be improved and this um this will also be improved and this um this Amazon Q is also going to help you Amazon Q is also going to help you Amazon Q is also going to help you generate the code fix for the generate the code fix for the generate the code fix for the suggestions above. So this is the first suggestions above. So this is the first suggestions above. So this is the first thing which Q does. It gives you the thing which Q does. It gives you the thing which Q does. It gives you the suggestion by ref by reviewing your suggestion by ref by reviewing your suggestion by ref by reviewing your code. It also helps you uh go a level code. It also helps you uh go a level code. It also helps you uh go a level further to suggest you uh how to fix further to suggest you uh how to fix further to suggest you uh how to fix this code as well which is even more this code as well which is even more this code as well which is even more amazing. So we can do two combos amazing. So we can do two combos amazing. So we can do two combos together like two developers working for together like two developers working for together like two developers working for me in the same time to fix my test code me in the same time to fix my test code me in the same time to fix my test code and also improve my code and things are and also improve my code and things are and also improve my code and things are going to just happen without me writing going to just happen without me writing going to just happen without me writing even a single line of code. That's the even a single line of code. That's the even a single line of code. That's the state of uh the jewels and of course state of uh the jewels and of course state of uh the jewels and of course software developers today like how software developers today like how software developers today like how things are going to be evolving but you things are going to be evolving but you things are going to be evolving but you can see that this is already amazing. can see that this is already amazing. can see that this is already amazing.
