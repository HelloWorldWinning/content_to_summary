Description:
好的，下面是根据您提供的文本生成的总结，包含大纲、核心观点、总体框架以及美人鱼图：

**总结：**

**一、 大纲：**

1.  **背景：** 亚利桑那·怀尔德（Arizona Wilder）自述其对光明会（Illuminati）和蜥蜴人（Reptilians）的认知。
2.  **光明会和蜥蜴人：**
    *   光明会由欧洲和英国的13个皇室血统控制。
    *   蜥蜴人需要人类的血液来维持其人形和理智，因为他们并非来自这个世界。
    *   为了获得血液中的某种物质，蜥蜴人需要恐怖化受害者。
    *   蜥蜴人在变形时会失去人形，并可能撕裂和吞噬受害者。
    *   肠道区域的脂肪被高度重视，用于他们的皮肤。
3.  **仪式：**
    *   蜥蜴人通过仪式从其他维度显现。
    *   仪式中会使用来自第三世界国家的儿童作为血祭，因为儿童拥有最纯净的能量。
    *   在仪式上见过乔治·布什、玛德琳·奥尔布赖特、亨利·基辛格、罗纳德·里根、南希·里根、希拉里·克林顿、洛克菲勒、杰拉尔德·福特、约瑟夫·门格尔、英国女王、玛格丽特公主、查尔斯王子、托尼·布莱尔、扎哈里亚·西琴等人，他们都曾变形为蜥蜴人。
    *   扎哈里亚·西琴的任务是散布关于光明会和蜥蜴人的虚假信息。
    *   在地下存在着蜥蜴人的蛋。
    *   皇室成员在仪式上饮用人血、食用人肉，并参与性乱仪式。
4.  **变形：**
    *   蜥蜴人可以通过变形改变年龄和力量。
    *   女王母亲在变形后会变得非常冷酷和残忍。
    *   变形时，鼻子会变长成鼻口，舌头变长，眼睛突出，身体长出鳞片和突起物，可能还有尾巴。
    *   他们通常身高约七英尺。
    *   血液的气味会引发变形。
    *   在睡眠或情绪激动时，蜥蜴人可能无意识地变形。
5. **戴安娜王妃：**
   * 当查尔斯王子在戴安娜王妃没有参加血祭仪式时，她是否可能看到他或其他人变成爬行动物？ 他们在睡觉时有变形的倾向，而且不会有意识地保持自己的形态，当他们睡着时，他们有变形的倾向。 可能会导致瞬间变形。

**二、 核心观点：**

光明会由伪装成人类的蜥蜴人控制，他们通过仪式和血祭来维持自己的存在和权力。

**三、 总体框架：**

该内容提供了一个关于光明会和蜥蜴人的阴谋论框架，其中蜥蜴人通过血祭和变形来控制世界，并维持其在人类社会中的统治地位。

**四、 美人鱼图：**

 But if we don't know about it, what can we do to stop it and to change it? I spoke to Arizona Wilder in Los Angeles, and this is what she had to say. But Arizona, can we start at the beginning and can you tell us the story of what's happened in your life from the very start? Okay, what I can tell you is that before I started looking into my life, back in 1989, I was starting to have flashes of things. And my life was not what it seemed to be, which is why I started looking into it. The Aryans, the Aryans, and the purity of the blood, and what it's all about is that the blood and the menstrual blood contain something that is important for the propagation of this race that is controlling the blood. And the things on this planet, they're called the Illuminati. And the Illuminati are actually run by these 13 bloodlines, which are all upper royal families in Europe and in England. And they need the blood because they are, in fact, not human. They take human shape. They are reptilians. And they need the blood, the blood helps them maintain their reptilian shape, and it helps them maintain their sanity, and it helps them to live in this world. Because they are not from this world. But what they need is, for it to be secreted in the blood is they need terrorization of their victims. They, before they are killed for their blood, and they have to terrorize them to get this to come out in the blood and be secreted in the blood. But they are killed at that moment as they are staring into their eyes. And not only do they, they can't hold their shape when this happens, they... The human shape. The human shape they cannot hold. They go back into reptilian shape as this is happening because it's like an animalistic type of excitement. Oftentimes, they can't... They will just rip into the victim and eviscerate them and start eating the flesh of this person too. And the fat from the intestinal area is highly valued as they use it on their skin. And they drink the blood, and the blood is highly sought after, and it goes according also to rank within these creatures. Why it's increases the ages. There are changes going on in the earth that seems they're not able to hold their shape like they once were able to, and people see them shape shift more and more. And they need the blood to try and maintain it. To try and maintain their human form. I believe there's a time coming because of what I've been told when they are not going to bother having to hold that human shape as they had to before. And they want that time to come. It's been about 4,000 years ago. The Aryan or the reptilians arrived here and again began to take over. And they instilled themselves in different places underground in the earth. And also this one part of them, the ruling part, took over and became involved in the politics and in the religion. And started controlling through these means at that point in time. Reptilian that come from another dimension they actually, they materialize from out of another dimension and are present at rituals. And they are so powerful and their presence is, there's such an evilness about them and they want out of this other dimension. Olin's are called out and they are what Christianity would have called the demons. Is this symbolism of the abyss anything to do with the fact that these reptilian demons of another dimension are somehow locked in time space prison and they can't get out and they're going to get out when they're brought out in that way? Yes, they want out of that dimension. They have been thrown into that dimension and they can't leave that dimension. And that's actually what the abyss is about is being in a different dimension. It's like something to do with the fourth dimension. So take us through one of these rituals that you conducted at the highest level of this global brotherhood. What would happen? And then they have these children that they're kidnapping and bringing in from other countries and no one misses them because these are third world countries. And children are the, they have the most energy, the purest energy, they're the highest form of sacrifice. They are used as actual blood sacrifices during these rituals because of again reptilians needing their blood. The blood will be gathered in a goblet and it will be dispersed among the reptilians. Are these rituals rare? I mean, how many other say go on a year? I mean, we can't have lots of thousands of them. There are things happening every month of the year. What happens on the night of Halloween? That night is about the worship and homage to Satan, the great deceiver Satan on that night on Halloween at this church. You've conducted them in Europe and the United States. Can we start with the United States? Yes, I have seen at rituals, I have seen George Bush, I have seen Madeleine Albright, I have seen Henry Kissinger, I have seen Ronald Reagan, and I have also, by the way, seen his wife, Nancy Reagan. I have seen Hillary Clinton before I knew she was Hillary Clinton at the time at these rituals she has involved. The other people that I have named and I have seen Shapeshift into reptilians, J. Rockefeller, and he Shapeshifts. These people seem to all be connected to the Illuminati. Gerald Ford, I have seen Shapeshift. Dr. Joseph Mengele, who took me around to these rituals a lot of the time, was also Shapeshifter. There are people in European countries that I have seen Shapeshift and be involved. The Queen there, I have seen Princess Margaret there, I have seen Charles there, and they Shapeshift. I have seen Tony Blair there, and he Shapeshifts. They all have their quirks as to how they act even in their reptilian form. Someone who has been talking about around this subject, and it seems to be popular right now. Who is that? This man by the last name of the Sitchin. I have seen rituals and he is a Shapeshifter. What do you remember about Zachariah Sitchin? Zachariah Sitchin was someone in the rituals who were attending the rituals who was not a major player as far as the rituals went. But was someone that others present did not make remarks that are very careful as to what they said around him. He was talking about doing away with people, persons that were in his way. We were not putting on information that he didn't feel that he wanted to put out. He is very much a disinformer, and that is his job to disinform about what is going on with the Illuminati and with the reptilians. He was actually a warm-knit officer investigating the reptilians, interestingly. There are eggs. It is like a nest of eggs kept down in that part where it is warm. It is very warm down there, into the entrance. These eggs are kept down there incubating, and they are the reptiles' eggs. What have you seen the royal family do, the Queen, the Queen Mother and the other people you have seen in the rituals? What have you seen them do? I have seen all of them drink human blood and consume human flesh, and they have their own goblets in which they have blood. These goblets are encrusted with jewels. They also have their own daggers. The dagger goes into the goblets where these robes, but they don't wear anything underneath the robes, because what is going to happen, what the rituals are all about, they are going to shape-shift. They can't have anything on under the robes. There are orgy kind of things that go on at the rituals also. Engolving the royal family of Britain? Yes, involving the royal family of Britain and the sacrifice and the eating of consuming the sacrifice, and they are involved in that. You have seen them do that? Yes, I have seen them do that. People in Britain listening to what you are saying would obviously be staggered, I guess anywhere in the world, but what would stagger them mostly is in Britain, the Queen Mother has an image of being the nation's grandmother, the nice old lady and good old Queen Mum, what a lovely lady. What's your experience of the Queen Mother? She is very cold in reality and she is very cruel. Obviously from what I see enjoys consuming human flesh. It's sickening. Who do they go into a different state in terms of age and strength and all these other attributes when they actually shape-shift? Yes, the human body that they choose to occupy or take when it was young, it ages, but when they take the reptilian form, these reptilians live hundreds of years. They have to have taken more than one human body to live in. A lot of them are much much older, including the Queen Mother and older than people think that she is. She is more than one body human form. When the time comes, if it is time for her to go on, it has been chosen that she has no life or years to go. Again, she will be put into the essence of her and the reptilian form. The essence of her will go into another body that has the ability to shape-shift into reptilian form. One of the pure reptilian human bloodlines. What happens when the Queen Mother is an example? What happens when they shape-shift? What do you see? You start to see changes happen and they are happening so fast that it's the closest thing that I've seen to it is what they are now doing with computer technology. It's just a literal transformation that happens very quickly. They get taller and they get bigger. They don't look at all as reptilians like they do as humans. Thus, the wearing of the robes because if they were in clothes, the clothes would be torn apart. So, let's take the Queen Mother on this subject as an example. We recognize her as a frail old lady. What does she look like when she shape-shifts at these richer rituals? She looks like she... The nose portion gets very much longer and it grows into a snout kind of thing. She has bangs. She has a tongue that has a tongue that has a tongue that has a tongue that has a long hair. Herri pointed projections are very long. They don't have hands or feet to have these claws. They have scales and also scales that seem to kind of disappear into one another. But it's more pronounced on the back. There seem to be lumps or protrusions coming from the head. There seem to be some kind of growth appendages where on the back they seem folded. Not all of them have that. There is a tail and a lot of times will keep the tail curled. I've seen her when she's very pleased with something. As I've seen other members like this, this tail is whipped around, very agitated and they do it. And she kisses. What color are they? Which one in particular? There's a taste of the Queen Mother as an example. She's kind of a beige color on the underside. And by the time you're going up around to the back and the tail and the top of the head and on top of the nose snout, whatever, it's coming to a very dark speckles of the tail. They're speckles of dark browns. The eyes usually, they're large. They look like they're coming out of their sockets. And very protruding. And usually the color ranges from a beige to a gold to a dark greenish gold. And then there's a struck slit up and down, a vertical slit. And when the eyes will look hooded, and when they look hooded, it's a very frightening thing because it seems that when the eyes are hooded, they're about to do something. What do you mean by hooded? The lids come down and they, it's almost, I guess it would be the same thing in a human as an expression of someone's got an idea. And how tall are they when they shape ship? They're about just about seven feet tall. Some are a little shorter, or two of which shorter. Some are a little bit taller than seven feet. What is it about the rituals that allow the shape ship you to happen? When they, when the victims are starting to be sacrificed, it's the scent of the blood. And they start shape shifting at that point in time. And they can hardly wait to get to the blood. It's, it's like they're addicted to the, to the blood. And then the consumption of human flesh that follows. What do you see in the queen or any of the raw family do in relation to that? You've seen them, have you seen them sacrifice and consume human flesh? There are certain times when they will actually do a sacrifice, or there will have been someone doing a sacrifice and it's not happening fast enough for them. So they will step in and finish it themselves because it, it's sacrificed has, the ritual has to be gone through the scent. You'd sacrificially, I mean ritualistically it has to have been gone through. And they will step right in and just start tearing this, this, the throat out. And they're getting all the blood from the jugular vein at the same time. And that has happened when they, when there are many there that are going to be sacrificed and they just can't wait. And then tearing into the contents of the abdomen and stomach of a victim afterwards. Who have you seen do that? I've seen the queen mother do that and Prince Philip and Charles. I've seen a Gita Russ child do this. It seems that I've seen it more among royalty or so called royalty do this than people that are not titled. They don't seem to, they seem like, it feels like they don't dare. But they, they, they shape shift nonetheless. But it's like the royals that step in and just start tearing away because they can hardly wait. How long can they hold the reptilian form in this occasion? And during the rituals, it's much easier for them to hold the reptilian form. They can stay in that form. What is, what, what it is is that they can't, they have a hard time holding their human form. And as long as they're around blood and the sin of blood, they can't hold human form. Is there any way when Diana was married to Charles without attending a blood ritual that she could have seen him or one of the others become a reptile? They have a tendency when they're asleep to shape shift and not, they have, they have to consciously hold their form and when they're asleep, they have a tendency to not hold human form in the shape shift. Inter-retilium would tend, that's not a blood would tend to cause a momentary shape shift.
