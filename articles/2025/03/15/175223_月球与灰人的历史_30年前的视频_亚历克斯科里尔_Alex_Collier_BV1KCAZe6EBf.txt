Description:
好的，这是对文本的总结，包括核心思想、结构化概要、总结性结论、总体框架以及 Mermaid 概念图。

**核心思想与总结**

核心思想是：地球和月球长期以来一直受到外星种族（包括爬行动物和灰人）的干预和殖民，而这些信息被世界政府隐瞒，其中灰人正在寻求拯救他们垂死的种族的方法。

**1. 结构化概要**

*   **月球的起源和性质：**
    *   月球是12,000年前被带到地球的人造卫星。
    *   它来自 Ursa Major 的 Chautau 星系，比地球更古老（91亿年）。
    *   月球上发现的材料与地球上的不同，且月球并非地球的一部分。
    *   阿波罗宇航员停止登月是因为月球上已经有“人”存在。
*   **地球的殖民历史：**
    *   地球已被殖民数百万年。
    *   最早勘测地球的是爬行动物种族，身高7-22英尺，重达1800磅，不喜人类。
    *   大约1.833名爬行动物仍然生活在地球地表下100-200英里处。
    *   北美是最早被殖民的地区之一。
    *   地底遍布隧道。
*   **灰人的起源和困境：**
    *   灰人最初来自 Zeta Reticuli II，约892,000年前离开。
    *   他们卷入了猎户座战争，被猎户座势力俘获，并进行了基因改造。
    *   灰人的情感被抑制，他们成为了没有情感的“机器人”。
    *   只有21,000,000个灰人拥有灵魂，其余的都是克隆体。
    *   灰人面临种族灭绝的危机，并寻求通过地球人来拯救他们的种族，但并未成功。
*   **世界政府的隐瞒：**
    *   世界政府长期以来知道这些信息，但为了权力而隐瞒。
    *   太阳系有八个人造单元，能够离开太阳系。

**2. 总结性结论**

地球和月球受到多个外星种族的长期影响，并且这些信息对公众隐瞒。

**3. 总体框架**

该内容的总体框架是以外星干预地球历史的阴谋论，涵盖了月球的起源、地球的殖民历史、灰人的困境以及世界政府的隐瞒。它试图揭示一个不为人知的地球和宇宙历史，涉及多个外星种族之间的互动和冲突。

**4. Mermaid 概念图**

 Moon was brought here 12,000 years ago. Our moon is in fact an artificial satellite. It is not a real planet. It can literally leave our orbit underneath its own power. According to the Andromeda, it was brought here from Ursa Meijer, from a star system called Chautau, that had 21 planets in it. It belonged to the 17th planet and it was one of four moons. Now, there are rumors all over it. That is there. There are some pictures there. There is a lot more which we don't have today. But it will become hell. This is why the Apollo astronauts stop going back. It's because there was somebody already there that told us that. This information is out there. Our moon is 9.1 billion years old. 9.1 billion years old. It is in fact older than the Earth. There are many of the materials that have been found on the moon minerals that exist on our planet. The moon did not belong to part of the Earth. It was brought here, literally. Our solar system has eight artificial units that were brought here. That literally underneath our own power leave our solar system. And there aren't beings living on it. That the operational and the world government know this. They've known it for a very long time. But they didn't want us to know. Because of the element of power. And we'll discuss that. Now... Earth has been colonized for off and on for many hundreds of millions of years. The first race to actually chart our planet was a group of empathetic components. They are reptilian beings. They're anywhere from 7 feet. They're 22 feet tall. It can weigh up to 1,800 pounds. And they don't like human beings. Not here, not anywhere. They were the very first to chart it. They were also the very first to actually have a small colony here. They were 109 million years ago. Now, one of the very first colonies or places that was colonized on the planet is North America. What we now call the United States. There are approximately, today, 1,833 of these reptilians still existing inside the planet. They have lived here for thousands of years. They live thousands of years. Their bodies are not like ours. They live anywhere from 100 to 200 miles beneath the surface. This is where they are. And it's all over. The planet is honeycomb with tunnels and catheters. There are approximately 18,000 what we know as grays. Between here and our moon. From underneath our to the surface of the planet and the moon. Now, the grays. The grays originally came from Zeta Reticuli II. I'm giving you a strong perspective. I'm not here to challenge anybody else's information. I'm going to tell you more in that perspective. The grays came from Zeta Reticuli II. They left there 892,000 years ago. They got trapped in a war called the Orion Party, which lasted 600,000 years. It was a galactic war between reptilian forces and human beings. What happened was they were captured by a group in Orion. The constellation of Orion, which is right. So, Valtrex, Ursa Major, Ursa Major. They were genetically altered there. Many of the females of their species were killed. So they could not reproduce so they could control the race. They also genetically altered them so that they're able to kill them. Their sexual organs would become atrophy and eventually they just wouldn't be there because they weren't being used. Now, the grays at the same time this was going on decided that the emotional part of themselves, their personality, was their weakest link. So they literally bred or thought out the emotional part of their bodies of their character. Which is why they had no emotion. They were robots. Today, there are approximately 21,000,000 actual grays, actual physical grays, that have a soul that are apart of the original race, the lineage of the original race, in our solar system. All the rest, virtually every single one that are doing the abductions on people are clones, they're robots. They're not. They don't have an essence. They don't have a soul in them. They're robots. Does everybody follow me so far? Okay. The grays have a problem with their dying. This is why they basically are here. Now, we as a planetary race offer them a great opportunity to possibly save their race. But it isn't working. And I'll explain why that is.
