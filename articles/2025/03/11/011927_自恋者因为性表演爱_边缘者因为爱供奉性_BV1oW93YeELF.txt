Description:
Here's a structured summary of the provided text, along with a conceptual map:

**1. Outlined Summary**

*   **Core Difference:** The fundamental distinction lies in the motivation behind sexual activity: self-pleasers use it to *perform* love, while borderline individuals use it to *seek* love and offer their sexuality as a sacrifice.
*   **Self-Pleasers (自恋者):**
    *   Driven by a need to fulfill their inflated sense of self (全能自恋).
    *   Experience discomfort when facing reality.
    *   Seek dopamine release through sexual encounters as an escape from reality and pain.
    *   Focus on the novelty and thrill of sexual experiences rather than genuine emotional connection.
*   **Borderline Individuals (边缘者):**
    *   Often have "physical intimacy cravings" (肌肤渴望症).
    *   Seek unconditional love through offering their bodies.
    *   May unknowingly engage in casual sexual encounters hoping for a deeper, more complete connection.
    *   Vulnerable to exploitation by self-pleasers who use them for sexual gratification.
*   **Dynamics:**
    *   Self-pleasers may initially "bombard" borderline individuals with sexual attention.
    *   Borderline individuals may mistakenly associate this sexual attention with love and believe they can maintain the relationship by providing constant sexual value.
    *   Two possible outcomes:
        *   Borderline individual can maintain the relationship through money and sex, but eventually realizes the relationship is empty and leaves.
        *   Self-pleaser discards the borderline individual once their sexual value is no longer needed.
*   **Root Cause:**  Early childhood experiences shape these patterns. Healthy individuals experience comprehensive love (physical and emotional) from caregivers.  Those with personality disorders may not have received adequate physical and emotional affection, leading to an inability to accurately identify and accept genuine intimacy. They remain stuck at a stage where physical sensation is misinterpreted as love.
*   **Conclusion:**  Without a healthy emotional foundation and mature intellect to guide relationships, all intimacy remains purely physical, which ultimately leads to emptiness.

**2. Core Point:**

Genuine love requires emotional and intellectual maturity; without it, intimacy remains a hollow physical act leading to emptiness.

**3. Overarching Framework:**

The content presents a comparative analysis of the motivations and behaviors of self-pleasing individuals and borderline individuals in the context of relationships, highlighting the developmental roots and consequences of their respective approaches to intimacy.
