Content:
the million dooll question that everybody wants to know which one's better Apex or takeprofit Trader today we're going to break it down talking about takeprofit trader and well Apex looking here at Apex what's the big sell right you receive 100% of the first 25, 000 two payouts per month basically you can request a payout with Apex every eight days the number of trading days for the eval would take profit Trad is 5 days with Apex it's one day now the big difference here between takeprofit Trader evaluations and Apex evaluations is with takeprofit Trader there is no trailing draw down on the evaluation but you have to trade for 5 days you need to have 50% consistency when it comes to the evaluation with Apex you can pass the evaluation in just one day but there is a trailing draw down during the evaluation phase now once you get into a takeprofit account funded account the pro account as they call it there will be a trailing draw down once you get above the buffer zone that trailing draw down goes away but it's something to be noted is it a bad thing that they have no trailing draw down on the eval verse trailing draw down on the funded I mean some people are like are like mad about it cuz they're like oh why do they have trailing draw down on the funded but not on the eval but I'm like hey it's easier to pass the evaluation without the trailing draw down whereas Apex has the trailing draw down in the eval and in the funded account but again same thing with Apex once you get above the buffer zone the kind of profit Target for that account you then no longer have the trailing draw down to worry about both prop firms both Apex and takeprofit Trader have no daily loss limit once you obviously get above the the uh buffer there's no more daily loss limit no trailing draw down $99, 000 profit goal very similar with takeprofit Trader as well with their 150k account same thing 9, 000 you can trade 15 contracts with the 150k account with take profit Trader whereas with Apex uh 17 contracts there so you got 17 contracts with a trailing threshold of 5, 000 with a $9, 000 profit goal and the eval for takeprofit Trader is $4500 end of day so you have an end of day trailing draw down in the evaluation for takeprofit Trader and then you've got the $5, 000 trailing threshold on the 150k account for Apex now again people like get upset about this because takeprofit Trader has it in the funding account but not in the eval but again I think it's like it's easier right making it easier for you to get funded once you're funded yes you do have to worry about the trailing draw down but there obviously are other benefits both Brokers or both prop firms allow you to trade with pretty much every platform out there with trade of8 with trading view with Ninja Trader and all the other fun ones as well kind of breaking it down here looking at the takeprofit trader Journey you start out in the test account being eval once you get funded you go into the pro account you can take a withdrawal on day one so that means you can take your first payout on day one of the pro account if you get above the buffer depending on the account size well you got to think about that buffer the 50k account the 150k account and and all that obviously a little a little different depending on the account size the one nice thing about takeprofit trader is if you really crush it and you do really well in the Pro account they're then going to move you into the Pro Plus account which is a 9010 profit split compared to the 8020 profit split in the Pro account there is no maximum amount withdrawal withdrawal amount there's uh no buffer requirement in the Pro plus there's no daily loss rule the intraday there's intraday draw down again on the pro the Pro Plus but once you get above that well then it works out a little easier you do have a news rule there's a news role for takeprofit Traders in the Pro account and the Pro Plus whereas with Apex there is no news rule once you're funded with Apex you go into what's called a PA account and you can have up to 20 of these accounts you do need to pass 20 evaluation accounts to then activate 20 funded accounts you can use the trade copier with trade ofate you don't have to paid for a trade copier if you use the groups the trade grouping with Apex or with takeprofit Trader there is no cost when it comes to the actual trade copying right now Apex is 80% off so the price is pretty much in comparison but there is the deal right now with take profit Trader sorry the deal with take profit Trader right now is 30% off with no activation fee so I do believe that the cost of takeprofit Trader is maybe a little cheaper than Apex right now after you pay for the activation fee so the evals up front are going to be cheaper with Apex and then the the uh no activation fee with take profit going to make it a little easier or a little cheaper once you get activated so if you do pass the evaluation and then you do go into a funed account with take profit Trader you don't have to pay the activation fee currently now the other thing that I really like about takeprofit trader is the fact that again you can take those payouts basically on day one once you get the account above that buffer you can then request a payout whereas with Apex you have to trade for a minimum of eight days now that's not a terrible thing right it's not terrible but you know they're give and take I personally I trade with take profit Trader and I trade with Apex I see nothing wrong with having multiple prop firm accounts with multiple firms that allows me to kind of Leverage the different prop firms the different rules where you know I can maybe trade the news with one Prof firm I can't trade the news with another Prof firm or I can just kind of trade a little differently based on the different rules here and again you know every prop firm has some good every prop firm has a little bit of bad compared like maybe not bad but the idea of the rules right the prop firms have to make it so that people can't game the system they can't just take you know millions and millions of dollars of payouts by you know doing some type of uh hedging or gaming of the trading system which we've seen is very easy to do but now the prop firms obviously are catching on to it I feel like uh takeprofit Trader has been kind of around for a long time but they kind of fly under the radar in terms of like the drama and all the Affiliates and everybody talking about them maybe everyone talks about them but I don't I don't really notice it but again take profit Trader vers Apex is there a clear winner if you're looking for a eval with no trailing draw down well then take profit Trader might be your best bet if you're looking for daily payouts then takeprofit Trader might be your best bet if you're looking to trade 20 accounts and to really Leverage The Copy trading well Apex is probably going to be your best bet once you get to what is it uh six actual payouts with take profit tra uh with Apex once you get the six payouts with Apex you can then request the like maximum amount of payout basically whatever your pnl is from those accounts which one's better which one's better you know I think it really just comes down to your style of trading what works best for you kind of uh trade the Prof forbs that have the best deals going on the best kind of uh just features that work for your trading style let me know down in the comments is there a is there a prop firm that really stands out for you but again just wanted to kind of talk about some of the differences you know right off the bat like I said the biggest difference for takeprofit Trader versus Apex is there is no trailing draw down in the evaluation phase now once you get into a funding account there is a trailing draw down very similar to apex apex allows you to trade 20 accounts takeprofit Trader allows you to trade five accounts so it's give in his take do you want 20 accounts do you want five accounts do you not want the trailing draw down in the beginning so many options so little time if you guys want to learn more check out onlyp firms. com for the best deals always use the code PW get 80% off at Apex get the 30% off with takeprofit Trader let me know down in the comments below takeprofit Trader vers Apex
