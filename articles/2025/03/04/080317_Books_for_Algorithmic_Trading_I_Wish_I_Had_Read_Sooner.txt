not all their content is trading so not all their content is trading so not all their content is applicable but they have a lot of applicable but they have a lot of applicable but they have a lot of general information that can be applied general information that can be applied general information that can be applied to trading the first book in this to trading the first book in this to trading the first book in this category is numerical recipes the art of category is numerical recipes the art of category is numerical recipes the art of scientific Computing this book is a huge scientific Computing this book is a huge scientific Computing this book is a huge reference for all kinds of different reference for all kinds of different reference for all kinds of different algorithms I have found these sections algorithms I have found these sections algorithms I have found these sections on optimization modeling and spectral on optimization modeling and spectral on optimization modeling and spectral analysis useful for my work but I'm analysis useful for my work but I'm analysis useful for my work but I'm confident as I learn more and have more confident as I learn more and have more confident as I learn more and have more ideas other content in this book may ideas other content in this book may ideas other content in this book may become valuable as well this book is become valuable as well this book is become valuable as well this book is massive the next book is assessing and massive the next book is assessing and massive the next book is assessing and improving prediction and classification improving prediction and classification improving prediction and classification by Timothy Masters this book really by Timothy Masters this book really by Timothy Masters this book really lives up to its title and has several lives up to its title and has several lives up to its title and has several methods for assessing and improving methods for assessing and improving methods for assessing and improving models it has a lot of content about models it has a lot of content about models it has a lot of content about combining multiple weaker models to combining multiple weaker models to combining multiple weaker models to build a powerful combined model reading build a powerful combined model reading build a powerful combined model reading this book really blurs the line between this book really blurs the line between this book really blurs the line between classification and regression they're classification and regression they're classification and regression they're not as different as I once thought if not as different as I once thought if not as different as I once thought if you are already using predictive models you are already using predictive models you are already using predictive models in your trading I recommend picking this in your trading I recommend picking this in your trading I recommend picking this book up you'll find something to try and book up you'll find something to try and book up you'll find something to try and hear the final book in this category is hear the final book in this category is hear the final book in this category is data-driven science and engineering by data-driven science and engineering by data-driven science and engineering by Steve Brunton and Nathan Cuts I got this Steve Brunton and Nathan Cuts I got this Steve Brunton and Nathan Cuts I got this book fairly recently and I'm still book fairly recently and I'm still book fairly recently and I'm still working through it but I included it working through it but I included it working through it but I included it because I very much like these sections because I very much like these sections because I very much like these sections on wavelets and dynamical systems it has on wavelets and dynamical systems it has on wavelets and dynamical systems it has good coverage of a technique called good coverage of a technique called good coverage of a technique called Dynamic mode decomposition which with Dynamic mode decomposition which with Dynamic mode decomposition which with the help of this book any paper written the help of this book any paper written the help of this book any paper written by the author Nathan Coates I used to by the author Nathan Coates I used to by the author Nathan Coates I used to create a pretty promising trading create a pretty promising trading create a pretty promising trading strategy I've yet to deploy it though strategy I've yet to deploy it though strategy I've yet to deploy it though the final category is Niche books these the final category is Niche books these the final category is Niche books these books didn't really fit into the other books didn't really fit into the other books didn't really fit into the other categories and don't have much to do categories and don't have much to do categories and don't have much to do with each other the first book Is with each other the first book Is with each other the first book Is technical analysis for algorithmic technical analysis for algorithmic technical analysis for algorithmic pattern recognition by these two authors pattern recognition by these two authors pattern recognition by these two authors this book shows automation techniques this book shows automation techniques this book shows automation techniques for Sharp patterns and it has a wealth for Sharp patterns and it has a wealth for Sharp patterns and it has a wealth of references to literature doing of references to literature doing of references to literature doing similar tasks in addition it shows quite similar tasks in addition it shows quite similar tasks in addition it shows quite a few ways to test the predictive a few ways to test the predictive a few ways to test the predictive performance of creating techniques in my performance of creating techniques in my performance of creating techniques in my opinion this book has the most unbiased opinion this book has the most unbiased opinion this book has the most unbiased and scientific coverage of technical and scientific coverage of technical and scientific coverage of technical analysis you can find the next book is analysis you can find the next book is analysis you can find the next book is detecting regime change and detecting regime change and detecting regime change and computational finance this book uses the computational finance this book uses the computational finance this book uses the directional change algorithm and a directional change algorithm and a directional change algorithm and a hidden Markov model to divide the market hidden Markov model to divide the market hidden Markov model to divide the market into regimes targeting essentially high into regimes targeting essentially high into regimes targeting essentially high and low volatility areas of the market and low volatility areas of the market and low volatility areas of the market it shows trading strategies built from it shows trading strategies built from it shows trading strategies built from this idea and it also has a valuable this idea and it also has a valuable this idea and it also has a valuable bibliography with references to a lot of bibliography with references to a lot of bibliography with references to a lot of useful papers the final book is trading useful papers the final book is trading useful papers the final book is trading on sentiment by Richard Peterson the on sentiment by Richard Peterson the on sentiment by Richard Peterson the author explains his experience building author explains his experience building author explains his experience building sentiment indicators for trading the sentiment indicators for

looking to do trading on sentiment this looking to do trading on sentiment this is worth reading it gave me several is worth reading it gave me several is worth reading it gave me several ideas when I was building sentiment ideas when I was building sentiment ideas when I was building sentiment indicators I have not updated my indicators I have not updated my indicators I have not updated my
