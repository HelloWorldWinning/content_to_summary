Hello, everyone, welcome back to the Insight Channel of Huihuisixiang. Insight into life and wisdom in identifying wealth. Remember to like, subscribe and turn on the little bell.

If a man tells me that he just wants to be a Buddhist with me for the rest of his life, I will tell him without hesitation that I just want wealth to give me stability, because a stable life needs wealth to support it. Buddhism without a material foundation is nothing but empty talk. If a woman tells me that she just wants to be a Buddhist with me for the rest of her life, I will tell her frankly that life is not like the red dust in romance dramas. Real life is full of challenges and competition. The Buddhist attitude pales in the face of cruel reality. A few days ago, a female friend on the planet asked me a question: Is there anything that you must not do during the rising period of your career? I thought about it seriously for a moment and gave a firm answer: Never choose Buddhism. After hearing my answer, the young girl laughed heartily and said, "That's absolutely impossible, because my ex-boyfriend is a typical Buddhist youth. Looking back now, he is simply an out-and-out idiot. Although the girl's words are straightforward and vulgar But he said the truth. It is true. If a person who has not yet entered the age of forty chooses a Buddhist life too early, it means that this person is most likely useless. I firmly believe that in your circle of life, someone must have said something similar: Just live your life down-to-earth, and I don’t ask for anything else. Whenever I hear such words, I can’t help but silently ask myself, what is the social status and economic situation of the person who said this? Think about it carefully, and you will find that they are usually not successful people in our definition. They often lack commendable achievements and have little disposable wealth. Because anyone who has truly owned wealth and truly experienced the power of money will shout from the bottom of their hearts that money is the bottom line, and only fools want to live a Buddhist life. Whenever this topic is discussed, there will always be people who bring up Jack Ma to refute it. They say that Jack Ma once publicly stated that the biggest mistake he made in his life was to found Alibaba. He also said that he was happiest when he only made a few hundred yuan a month. Do you really believe this statement? Imagine if Jack Ma was given a chance to start over now, what choice do you think he would make? I believe that he will still re-establish Alibaba without hesitation, and once again express his indifference and contempt for wealth and career after he has achieved success. This may be a unique attitude of successful people, but it is definitely not their true inner thoughts. Therefore, as long as you pay a little attention, you will find that among those young people who often talk about "Buddha", the vast majority are those who have developed mediocrely among their peers, or even those who are not doing well. Because the so-called "Buddha" is essentially a helpless "giving up". It means that I have recognized the reality and accepted my mediocre fate. I no longer have any extravagant hopes and pursuits for my future life. It is better to say that it is a kind of self-comfort than pursuing a lifestyle. Hey, the word "Buddha" sounds quite literary and seems to have a touch of elegance. Then take it as my life creed. Of course, everyone has the right to choose the lifestyle they want. This is an unquestionable personal freedom. However, since you have met my video today, I have the responsibility and obligation to discuss with you as a person who has experienced it, why "Buddha" and some so-called "local feminism" are both seemingly beautiful and positive. In fact, it is a negative trend that is poisoning people's lives, because there is a fatal difference between the two, that is, local feminism will at best only cause oneself to suffer greatly, while " Buddha-style" may very likely drag the entire family into the abyss. Here, I would like to insert a digression. What needs to be clarified is that the word "Buddha-style" is actually not suitable to describe a life attitude of self-abandonment, because in the highest Buddhist classic, the Lotus Sutra, and in many Buddhist scriptures, there are clear explanations. The Lotus Sutra, "The Merits of the Master", says that "all livelihoods and other activities are in accordance with the Dharma. " The 19th volume of the Wisdom Treatise also mentions that " all means of livelihood are righteous and not evil. " The meaning of these scriptures is that from the perspective of orthodox Buddhist teachings, everyone has the right and deserves to have abundant wealth, because wealth itself is not the source of sin, but a tool that can be used to improve life and benefit all beings. The key lies in whether the way of obtaining wealth is legitimate. In other words, your understanding of "Buddha-style" is equal to poverty and hardship, but it is actually a one-sided and even wrong perception. You may not know that any of the TOP50 temples in China Its annual financial statements clearly show that the profitability of "True Buddha" is no less than that of a small or medium-sized listed company. This is the true portrayal of "True Buddha". So why are there so many young people who claim to be "Buddhists" in society now? The reason is that they happen to live in an era where material is relatively abundant and they can barely maintain food and clothing even without making too much effort. It is undeniable that today's society is highly competitive and life pressure is huge. Everyone is complaining that life is not easy and difficult. Even if you choose a "Buddhist" lifestyle, do not work hard, stay at home every day to watch short videos and play mobile games, you can barely maintain a basic life. However, the vast majority of young people who are addicted to "Buddhism" do not realize that the seemingly comfortable and comfortable "Buddhist" life they are enjoying is gradually pushing them into the abyss of "waste". There was once a good friend in the past who had a wealthy family, a huge family business, and two sons born in the 1990s. This means that with superior family conditions, plus a little effort on their own, they can easily live a rich and comfortable well-off life. However, it is regrettable that these two children have entered society just three years later. The trajectory of his life has changed dramatically. The younger brother is an extrovert by nature, likes challenges, and craves a sense of achievement. This pursuit also extends to his work. In his three-year career, this young man has been making mistakes almost constantly. But surprisingly, every mistake has become a valuable learning opportunity and growth ladder for him. Just like a professional boxer, from being able to passively take beatings at first, to gradually mastering the skills of counterattack, and finally growing into a strong man with the ability to win, the whole process stems from his long-term and unremitting "struggle". In other words, it is constant "evolution". The situation of the elder brother is completely different. He is naturally introverted and advocates a " Buddhist" life. Although he is serious and responsible about his work, he always maintains a cautious and muddle-headed attitude. He lacks ambition and career. Perhaps because of his wealthy family and worry-free material life, he does not have a strong desire for wealth and achievement. His superiors' evaluation of him is also average. They ca n't find any faults, but they can't see any bright spots. Over time, he fell into a stagnant deadlock in the workplace, gradually became negative and lazy, and even began to deny himself. To put it more bluntly, it is "degeneration". That's right. I forgot to add that the two brothers entered the same company and worked in the same department under the arrangement of their father. But today, the younger brother has been promoted to a quasi-middle-level manager of the company, while the older brother is still in the same place, earning the initial salary and marking time. You see, this is one of the biggest drawbacks of the "Buddhist" lifestyle. The seemingly nonchalant and indifferent attitude towards life that it advocates is actually worthless and meaningless. It is just wasting time in a comfortable environment and adding to one's age. No one will care about an ant who does not make progress and does not fight for his own life. One day, this worried friend asked me for help and asked if there was any remedy to reverse the decline. My answer was a little helpless, but it was extremely true. "The upper one seeks the Tao, and the lower one seeks Buddha. " The brother's personality has completely collapsed. Once a person indulges in "Buddhism", it is equivalent to giving up his own life. Seeing this, you may be confused. What does "Buddhism" mean to give up life? I just want to live my own life quietly, play games and watch short videos every day. Is there anything wrong with this, young man? You are really still too young and too simple Sometimes naive Sometimes there is only a fine line between naivety and ignorance. When you are in your forties or fifties and look back at your thoughts when you were young, you will find how ridiculous, pathetic and lamentable you were at that time. As I emphasized at the beginning of the video, only those who have truly possessed wealth will deeply understand how disgusting "Buddhism" is. Because the era you and I live in today is an era of rampant materialism and extreme reality. The wealth of this era can buy not only the quality of life, but even life. Someone once questioned and refuted my point of view. I think that people who raise such objections either have no social experience and do not understand the rules of how the world works, or they are typical people who talk without any pain and do not understand the hardships and cruelty of life. As long as you pay a little attention, you will find that the poor are often helpless when facing serious illnesses. They can only watch their loved ones being devoured by the disease and rely on basic medical insurance to support themselves. When the rich face the same predicament, they can choose a variety of advanced treatment options and enjoy better medical services. The huge gap is obvious. After all, the efficacy and side effects of domestically produced drugs reimbursed by medical insurance are much lower than those of imported drugs purchased at their own expense. How big is the gap? I believe that any rational person knows it well. Of course, I am not trying to persuade all young people to become so-called "strugglers". Who doesn't want to live a relaxed and unfettered life? " Idle clouds and wild cranes, small bridges and flowing water, elegant spring music, poetry and distant places" - these words, just hearing them, make people feel relaxed and happy, and fascinated. But, if after you have been "Buddhist" all your life, in your twilight years, when you see your parents dying, you can only curl up helplessly on the crowded corridor and extra beds in the hospital, watching them linger in pain, while you yourself are short of money and powerless, and can only watch those people next door who worked hard in their early years put their parents in spacious and bright high-end wards, enjoying the best medical resources, can you still stick to the "Buddhist" three views that you advocated when you were young, and not feel regret and guilt? So, after you have been "Buddhist" all your life, when you see your children being suffocated in the fiercely competitive public schools because of the destruction of the exam-oriented education They have lost their innocent childhood, while those parents next door who worked hard in their early years can calmly send their children from private schools all the way to famous overseas universities for further studies, so that their children can receive the most advanced education and have a broader future. When you look back at your own children, they are crushed by the heavy academic pressure at an early age and are completely left far behind by others at the starting line of life. Can you still maintain the so-called Buddhist three views with peace of mind and not feel regretful? You see, no matter how Buddhist a person is, he is not a real god or Buddha after all. What's more, even those real gods and Buddhas we worship, they all sit safely in the solemn temples, quietly enjoying the offerings of the world, and all of this requires a steady stream of real money to support and maintain. So please never believe in those cheap Buddhist philosophies of life. They are nothing more than the self-consolation of the weak, the fig leaf of the mediocre, and the spiritual anesthetic of the losers. People live for only a few decades, and what are we living for? Is it just for Are you really willing to live such a mediocre and ordinary life? Are you really willing to let your life be so mediocre and so idle? Are you really willing to face the weathered and old self in the mirror alone one day many years later and regret your choice today? Is this the answer to life you want? Today's sharing ends here.
