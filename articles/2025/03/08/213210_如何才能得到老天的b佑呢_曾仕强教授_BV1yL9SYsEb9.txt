Description:
Okay, I will summarize the provided Chinese text according to your requirements.

**Summary:**

1.  **Core Point:** We need to actively cultivate "zeng qi" (增气 - translated as "increasing energy/vitality"), rather than passively waiting for divine intervention, as inherent well-being is not guaranteed and requires effort.

2.  **Overarching Framework:** The content revolves around the concept of "四天有子" (si tian you zi), which seems to describe a state of inherent well-being that is not automatically bestowed. The speaker emphasizes that this state ("四天有子") is not a gift from heaven or protection from enemies, but something to be actively cultivated ("增气"). The text implies that passively waiting for external forces to provide well-being is futile, and individuals must actively nurture their own vitality. The speaker connects this idea to their actions, suggesting a desire to improve the world through conscious effort and modification.

3.  **Outlined Structure:**

    *   **Introduction of "四天有子" (Si Tian You Zi):** This term represents a desired state of being.
    *   **Refutation of Passive Expectation:** The speaker argues that "四天有子" is *not* simply a blessing from heaven or protection from enemies.
    *   **Emphasis on Active Cultivation ("增气"):** The core message is the importance of actively cultivating inner energy/vitality ("增气"). Waiting passively is ineffective.
    *   **Call to Action:** The speaker encourages listeners to actively work on "增气" and improve the world.
    *   **Future Plans:** The speaker suggests plans to improve or modify the current situation.
