Description:
Okay, I will distill the core ideas, summarize them in an outlined structure, provide the core point, overarching framework, and generate a mermaid conceptual map.

**Summary:**

1.  **Core Idea:** A true strong person prepares for setbacks even during their peak by cultivating loyal allies who can provide support in the future.

2.  **Outline:**

    *   **Importance of Planning:** Strong individuals proactively plan for potential downturns.
    *   **Cultivating Allies:** Invest in cultivating 2-3 absolutely reliable allies ("iron friends") who are not directly involved in your current endeavors.
        *   **Strategic Positioning:** Keep them outside your immediate circle of influence.
        *   **Limited Interaction:** Maintain infrequent contact.
        *   **Discretion:** Keep these relationships private.
    *   **The Nature of Success:** Recognize the impermanence of success and resources ("人物百日好花物百日红").
    *   **Future Leverage:** These allies serve as a safety net for potential future recovery.
    *   **Critical Ally Selection:** Choose individuals who are grateful and capable.

3.  **Core Point:** A truly capable individual always plans for potential failure, even during times of success, by cultivating loyal, strategically positioned allies.

4.  **Overarching Framework:** Strategic risk mitigation through cultivating external, loyal, and capable allies as a contingency plan for future setbacks.

5.  **Mermaid Conceptual Map:**
