welcome to another edition of Ricina 2025 ideas pod Uh in this uh special session we will be discussing uh we will be taking stock of the Asian century uh as it were and to to talk about all things Asia and uh and the world Uh I have with me um a very special guest uh Kishor Meubani uh at the moment distinguished fellow with the Asian Research Institute and US Singapore but he's much more than that He has been a writer an author and perhaps one of our singular thinkers on Asia and and and how that Asian political order geopolitical order has evolved over the last several decades So sir welcome Uh I think let's start from the from the beginning because you have talked a lot about uh Asian century Asian values Uh you have been a big exponent of that proponent of that How when you look back at at your assessment of the last few decades um what all you got right and what all you got wrong i think let's start from there and then we we put push on into the into the territory where we what is happening at the moment But but you you're absolutely right when you say that uh I've been writing about the rise of Asia or return of Asia for several decades now In fact going back to 1992 I spent a year in Harvard 9192 at a time when the West was feeling incredibly triumphant after the end of the cold war and Francis Fukuyama said the West had reached the end of history and the rest of you you poor chaps you have to become like us And I remember at a Harvard seminar uh with a very famous Harvard professor called Professor Stanley Hoffman and I said this you know in ' 9192 that actually the future will be Asian His face went red He almost became epoplastic What do you mean it's the west so I think one thing what is shocking is that the greatest western minds have not realized two basic points The first basic point is that for most of human history especially over the last 2, 000 years China and India always had the largest economies for 1800 after the last 2, 000 years So the last 200 years have been a major historical aberration and now you've seen the natural return of Asia and it's happening at a dramatic speed You know like one statistic I give okay 100 years ago Europe could run the world as recently as 1980 the economy of the combined economy of the European Union was 10 times the size of China 1980 Europe 10 times the size of China Today they're about the same size By 2050 Europe will be half the size of China Now when Europe goes from being 10 times the size of China to becoming half the size of China in in one lifetime it shows you how much the power has shifted uh to Asia You also ask me what I got wrong I assume that since the west had traditionally been dominated by relatively rational thinking and believes that at the end of the day you must work out the most rational long-term policies for you know getting the west to adjust to a new world I thought they'd be rational but instead they have been irrational And certainly when you elect a man like Donald Trump who's driving forward by looking at the rear view mirror to make America great again he wants to bring America back to the past He doesn't understand that now it's a different world So from the end of history now to almost uh the return of history if you will in in the sense of Europe in particular there is this big debate about the return of geopolitics as if it ever went went away Uh here comes Mr Trump as as as you were describing Now he's disrupting a lot of the assumptions uh you know around which a lot of western foreign policy has revolved Whether you look at his assumption about the economic globalization and how you interpret that and its impact on national societies whether you look at the impact of uh and the role of multilateral institutions in global politics uh whether you look at the role of identity in shaping foreign policy uh how uh lasting do you think uh the impact would be because you can interpret it in multiple ways right you can say that look he's an aberration because there is a there's a consensus in American foreign policy around certain core themes those those those assumptions would hold Uh you know he will be there for for four more years and maybe Trumpism in some form would remain but the core sort of American identity of foreign policy would would would be retained So you would go back to transatlantic solidarity you would go back to Europe being the primary theater of operations etc So are you are you optimistic along those lines or do you see a fundamental churn happening in so far as what Mr Trump represents i think what you describe very well is what I call the uh consensus among many western liberals that essentially we've been running the world very well Then now there comes along this guy whom I think Gideon Raman call a Donald Trump Okay he's a temporary problem He'll go away and then we can go back to the good old days of the past And this is where the liberals get it completely wrong And the reason they get it completely wrong is that they don't try to understand Forget Trump Who are the people who voted for Trump why did the majority of the people vote for Trump not once twice right and after a 4-year interval because the liberals have let down the peoples of their own society And you know the United States is is a modern developed country is the only modern developed country where life expectancy has come down as an indicator of social problems And the bottom 50% have not seen any improvement in their standard of living for over 30 years now And it is this anger of the bottom 50% that the liberals have created an order which benefited them a great deal they all became rich and wealthy and so on so forth partly through the universities and all that and they ignored the masses So Trump understood this anger and Trump is riding this anger and if the liberals want to go back to the good old days of the past they first got to ask themselves very honestly why did we fail our own people why did we not recognize that our people were in acute distress you know this Nobel laurate Angus Don has written a book called deaths of despair which gives tremendous number of statistics how people are dying uh from despair So for to if you really want to address the problem of Trump forget Trump the individual focus on the bottom 50% And by the way one important uh fact to add here is that functionally the United States has also become a putoaucracy where most of the wealth is going to top 1% 0. 1% and you know and if you have a putoaucracy you know as I said in a recent Oxford Union debate it's by definition the opposite of a democracy So there are some fundamental challenges that the liberals have to deal with if they want to go back to the good old days So coming back to to to our part of the world uh um Asia Asia Pacific IndoPacific whatever the term people might want to use but now uh the impact of what is happening in the west on on on this part and you have written a lot about as we we started this conversation about the Asian century Now the first 25 years of this of this century uh have been have seen dramatic shifts You know there have been enormous economic cooperation economic interdependence uh trade flourishing among among countries but also a degree of contestation that that you have had and particularly a more aggressive Chinese foreign policy leading to push back from various quarters um in the region Now uh when you when you look at the next 75 years if if one can look at in this day age of massive change and massive churn what is your assessment that the idea of Asia how how potent that would remain because you are looking at this region as a center of gravity of global economics first and global politics thereafter Yeah Let me let me begin by mentioning a small fact that that sort of illustrates the point that the world is psychologically preparing for the Asian century You know I came up with a book of open access free book uh with Springer Nature a German publisher uh and I asked the German publisher this book called live uh called it's called the Asian 21st century What's your target how many downloads should we try to get with this open access book they said if you get 20, 000 downloads it'll be a great success Well instead of 20, 000 downloads there have been close to 4 million downloads if this book in 160 countries I mention this because it shows you that psychologically people around the world are saying that it is going to be the Asian century and the data shows very clearly how economic power is shifting rapidly I mean if you want to talk about the I I compared China to the EU if you compare China to the US in the year 2000 US was eight times bigger than China Today is 1. 5 times bigger When the in the year 2000 began UK was in the top five India was not in the top 10 Today India is in the top five and UK is falling out of the top 10 That's an example of how the world is changing and turnurning uh as a result of the return of Asia and I am actually very optimistic for Asia because most Asians realize that this is their hour and but to succeed the most important thing you have to do is ensure you don't get caught in major wars And you know when the cold war ended there I I've cited several American political scientists who said Asia's future will be Europe's past that world war II World War will happen in Asia because that's where the power shifts are happening but we've had a long piece uh 46 years of no major wars in Asia and by contrast you see the Yugoslav wars the Ukraine war the wars are happening on the fringes uh of Europe so Asia is getting some things Right And that's what we need to understand And one important point that I hope more people will pay attention to is the role of ASEAN You know in Southeast Asia I'd love to come to that because you know uh ASEAN is by far the most diverse region of planet Earth Among the 700 million people you have 250 million Muslims 150 million Christians 115 million Buddhists Mahayana Buddhist and Nayana Buddhists you have Tawist you have Confucianists you have Hindus and you have lots of communists in Southeast Asia It there's no other region in the world that is as diverse as Southeast Asia is And look at this region It's become one of the most peaceful and prosperous corners uh of planet earth I mean I think any Indian would be shocked to learn that in the year in the decade 2010 to 2020 ASEAN which is 1/5 the size of the European Union added more to global economic growth than the European Union did This is a stunning statistic you see So there are some things that are being done right down there And within the region also um there's a lot of emphasis on opening up the trade and the world's largest free trade agreement the regional comprehensive economic partnership is functioning in the region We wanted India to join uh as you know sadly India decided not to join but the door is always open for India to come and join the regional uh comprehensive economic partnership But I can tell you when future historians look at our time they'll actually be quite amazed at what we in Asia have accomplished in the first 25 years of this Asian century and the next 25 years will be even better So just on this point uh uh Kishor on um you know Assean centrality all if you see most of the players in the region they do talk of Assean centrality some are better at it than than others in operationalizing that idea uh but the issue that I I thought uh if you can just deliberate a bit more is that even if we keep ourselves away from wars the sense that a great power competition is looming that's that is becoming you know almost that is taken as a given now um and across administrations from Trump 1. 0 to Biden to now Trump 2. 0 to there are indications of that competition particularly on technology becoming much more direct and much more tenuous now So so the question now is how do countries in the region uh secure their space from this competition and and and allow their agency to flourish because as you know the biggest problem ASEAN had been facing or had faced traditionally is this you know economic partnership with the China versus security partnership with the US and how do you balance the two some countries get it right some countries don't but by and large ASEAN has done well in navigating that that that trend but that was when the the competition was at at a much lower level Now as it accelerates do you do you see that sense that we will get it right this time also uh you know now that the structural realities are moving in a very very difficult space especially over the next few years Well you know there's absolutely no question uh that the US China contest will accelerate over the next 10 or 20 years you know and you know I wrote a book has China won about it And it's it's an iron law of history that when the world's number one emerging power today is China is about to overtake the world's number one power which today is the US the number one world's number one power will always push down the world's number It's it's like a mechanical thing that happens in history So there's no question but the question is how do you manage it and I actually think it can be managed you know and for example I think Donald Trump uh if whose first priority is to grow the American economy while he'll be tough on China he's also open to a deal uh on on China so you know that in that sense he might be uh uh not completely bad news for China And in the case of ASEAN you're right ASEAN has made every effort to be friends with uh China to be friends with the US and we have actually succeeded in a spectacular fashion Let me just give you some data In the year 2000 uh US trade with Southeast Asia with ASEAN was 135 billion and China is only 40 billion So less than one/ird US trade By 2022 US trade had gone to 500 billion But China's trade with ASEAN had grown to almost 1 trillion 975 billion from 40 to 9 you know So these are phenomenal figures Okay It was the world's largest trading relationship But at the same time we also have a situation whereby US has invested more in ASEAN than it has in China Japan Korea and India combined Even though China Japan Korea and India are much bigger economies the than ASEAN is So it shows you there's some degree of geopolitical uh acumen in Southeast Asia that has been developed over the years So I'm reasonably confident that we can navigate these difficult geopolitical waters Kisher I I just want to end but I have to ask this question Uh one final one if if you can be very brief Uh you you've talked about you know rising and falling powers and how they they relate to each other So the reality of China rising is also you know a fact that it it is ris its interests are expanding uh and in some have viewed China's uh rise as an economic power uh and and related it to somewhat expansionist ideas that it has had in in South China Sea or East China Sea or in in with borders in in the Himalayas Do you see that trend also through the through the lens of a rising power trying to shape its periphery or is there some other explanation perhaps domestic politics or perhaps the personality of the of the present what how do you assess that dynamic i I always begin by emphasizing one point the I the idea that and that you can have a benevolent great power but the term benevolent great power is an oxymoron All great powers including United States China will put their interest first and there's absolutely no question that China will become far more assertive as it becomes stronger and bigger and more muscular But there's a big difference between being assertive and being aggressive So I predict that China will become more assertive but it won't become more aggressive because the one of the things the Chinese have learned over 2, 000 years that the worst way to win a war is to fight it So the first goal of any good leader is to avoid wars I mean you still exercise influence you you they you have a lot of impact and all that but you don't get involved in wars because wars at the end of the day is what is what will drag you down and wars at the end of the day will prevent China from achieving what it wants to become which is the number one economy in the world So whether in South China Sea or in Taiwan straight you see a more optimistic scenario I bers I predict that there will be no wars there Okay Thank you so much It was fascinating to talk about Asia China Trump administration and how the world is changing so rapidly perhaps also taking stock in the process of how how the century is evolving and in which direction Uh it was a fascinating conversation that covered a lot of track I hope we had more time but thank you Mish for joining us this morning Thank you Thank you Thank you very much Let's straight into
