Dating is always more tiring than exercising! Why do you always have to chase me and I have to catch you when you hide? When an anxious dependent meets an avoidant dependent, how can they have a comfortable and healthy relationship together? Do you still like the video content we release every week? Then hurry up and support us by subscribing to let us know that you also like the content we release! If there are any interpersonal relationship topics you would like to learn more about, please leave a message below to let us know. We will gradually release videos and share them with you according to the order of the questions and the difficulty of the prepared content! A while ago, when we were discussing the topic of emotional attachment, a fan was brave enough to bring up his own relationship problems with us. He was curious about what would happen if two people at two extremes of emotional attachment fell in love, that is, when an anxious attacher and an avoidant attacher liked each other and started dating. How would they talk about this relationship and enjoy their relationship more and more every day? I believe this is a problem for many anxiously attached people, and it is also the answer that avoidantly attached people need before they can enjoy love! Thank you very much to this fan for asking us this question so that everyone can benefit from it. So, are you ready to find the answer with him? Today, let psychologists tell you the answer! Hi everyone, I’m Chien! Welcome back to MACHIEN's Relationship Talk. Perhaps you find it puzzling that since avoidant attachers are so afraid of intimacy and need personal space and freedom, why would they fall in love with an anxious attacher? Similarly, since an anxious attacher needs so much attention from his or her partner, why would he or she fall in love with an avoidant attacher who cares more about himself or herself than his or her partner? Let me answer the first question first! Why would an emotionally fearful avoidant attacher enter into an intimate relationship? And what should an anxious attacher do when he or she falls in love with such an avoidant attacher? Have you seen "Resurgence" starring Tom Hanks? Everyone living in this world needs an emotional connection and relationship, even avoidant dependents are no exception. In some studies on avoidant dependents, psychologists have found that avoidant dependents actually desire and need the recognition and emotional connection of others. They are not as free and easy as they say (Carvallo & Gabriel, 2006). This is also more or less why when an avoidant dependent first meets an anxious dependent, they will interact more with each other, because they feel cared for and recognized. At this time, if the other person resonates with them in their views or ideas on certain things, the avoidant dependent's liking for the other person will increase! But now comes the problem! That is, the avoidant dependents seem to have forgotten that for a relationship to get better and better and last longer, it must require equal emotional investment and mutual openness from both parties. However, as we mentioned before, opening up and expressing one's emotional needs is a very scary thing for the avoidant dependents. Due to the trauma of past relationships, they are very afraid of truly relying on others and sharing deeper emotions with their partners. As a result, the anxious dependents are the ones who need the other party to constantly share emotions. So when they find that the other party does not seem to open up more of their emotions as the time they spend together increases, they become anxious and panic, and begin to wonder why. "Does the other party not love me anymore? " "Does he have someone else he likes? " Questions like these keep circling in their minds, but the fact is Avoidant dependents just need more space and time to process their emotions. To be more specific, since avoidant dependents are not very good at dealing with emotions, they will habitually use a "deactivating strategy" to avoid their emotional needs. That's why they are used to saying things like "I can be fine alone, " "Dating is troublesome, " "You will lose your freedom after getting married, " etc. , trying to downplay their need for affection. If at this time, the anxious partner keeps pestering them and insists on getting to the bottom of it, it seems to indirectly verify the negative thoughts in the avoidant dependent's heart. Gradually, they will become colder and more distant towards their partner. The anxiously attached person will only cling to the other person more confusedly, and of course, it will end up being a chase between you and me! If the avoidant dependent happens to meet a good partner at this time, they will compare this person with their significant other, start to over-glorify this person, and dislike their significant other in various ways. Before long, the anxious dependent will find that their guess is true, and the other person really does not love them and has fallen in love with someone else. So, as an anxious dependent, what should you do? If you really love the other person, then learn to give him/her more time and space! He may suddenly stop reading your messages and disappear when your relationship seems to be getting closer. Don’t panic or keep asking him questions. You can ask him once, “What’s wrong? Do you need to talk? ” and let him know that you will be there for him even if the sky falls. Then, let him be alone and decide whether to tell you what’s on his mind. Even if he doesn’t tell you anything in the end, don’t force him to tell you the reason! Afterwards, remember to care about him as usual, but don't care about him like you would take care of him three times a day. This will really put pressure on people. Even a secure attached person will be driven crazy by you. If you are an anxious attached person who is prone to doubting your self-worth, you can also record some of the sweet interactions between you and your partner. For example, maybe your partner has done something very thoughtful to make you feel loved, then write it down in a very important notebook of yours. In this way, when your partner starts to avoid you or treat you coldly again, you can take out these records to remind yourself that your partner really loves you and ease your inner anxiety and fear. In addition, I want to say something special here. Don't be a person who has no humanity towards the opposite sex. In other words, even if you meet a dating partner Don’t spend all day with your significant other and forget about your friends, because these friends can be the ones who help you overcome emotional problems! They can not only divert your attention when your avoidant partner starts to ignore you, but also accompany you to face the feeling of loneliness and anxiety. So remember to cherish every friend around you. After talking so much about how anxious dependents deal with avoidant dependents, do you think that avoidant dependents just need to talk about relationships as freely as possible? No, no, no. Now let me answer the second question! What should an avoidant attacher do when he or she meets an anxious attacher? As mentioned before, you with avoidant attachment will likely start to panic when you feel strong emotions: "What should I do if I have to build a closer relationship with another person and open up to them? " "Will I get hurt by being so naked? " So you will start to list a lot of disadvantages of dating or getting married in your mind, but deliberately ignore the good times you had with each other. But in fact, deep in your heart, you know that the other person loves you and you love him/her too, so quickly kick out these excuses you use to convince yourself not to fall in love! Don’t let these thoughts deceive yourself and affect your behavior in intimate relationships! At the same time, learn from my advice to anxious dependents and keep a list of the other person’s strengths! When you find yourself constantly dwelling on trivial matters and deliberately magnifying the other person's shortcomings in order to prevent yourself from being too invested in this relationship, quickly find this notebook and read it carefully to remind yourself that the other person's strengths really outweigh the shortcomings you think they have. The last and most important reminder is to remember that "a relationship is a matter between two people. " Since you love the other person in your heart, you must work hard to overcome your fear of being hurt, tell the other person your emotions and feelings in a timely manner, and learn to rely on your partner. When you also begin to invest in the emotions that you should invest in, you will find that you will not lose your freedom or be hurt by rejection. On the contrary, your partner will be very touched by your openness and will cherish your emotions even more, regardless of whether you are the avoidant dependent or the anxious dependent. I believe that when you can take the suggestions I shared today to heart and get along with each other in that way, you will not only begin to enjoy your intimate relationship, but also slowly heal your emotional attachment disorder through this relationship and become a secure attached person! I also look forward to hearing from you about the growth and changes in your relationships in the future! Do you like the interpersonal relationship psychology content we share every week?
