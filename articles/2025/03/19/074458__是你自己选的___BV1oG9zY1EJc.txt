 You complain about the life that you chose. You are not a victim. Not at all. Your generosity can see in something dirtier and meaner. You're incapable of facing your ambitions and you resent me for it, but I'm not the one who put you where you are. I've nothing to do with it. You're not sacrificing yourself, as you say. You choose to sit down the sidelines because you're afraid. Because your pride makes your head explode before you can even come up with a little shower for an idea! And now you wake up and you're fortunate and you need someone to blame and you're the one to blame! You petrified by your own fucking standards and your fear of failure. This is the truth. To much too much time, too many concessions, I want this time back and you owe it to me. Be fair. I'm sorry, but no, I'm not saying. I don't owe you anything. Really? This is your own trap! Okay, it's your name. It's your trap! No! I'm not taking time. You've twice it in all your own. I want things to change now. Look at you, ease and you'll put it more or less. Put it more on ice in what you do. Yeah. And this feeling is a way for you to waste more time. About who's, who's, who's blaming who, who's frustrating, who the frustration is there. And we're both dealing with it, you see. That's nothing to do with it! Stop it!
