Content:
 At 22 years old, I make over $1.3 million per year with a one-person business, working just four hours per day. I don't have full-time staff, I don't have regular team meetings, and I don't have to work weekends. This gives me complete time freedom to go on spontaneous holidays, spend quality time with my mom, which would be impossible if I was running a traditional business. But the craziest part is, when I got started, I built my one-person business from zero to $10,000 per month with barely any business skills and just my iPhone. Now recently, I've seen a bunch of videos talking about how beginners can do the same, but honestly, most of these videos are super confusing. The truth is, if you want to make $10,000 per month with a one-person business, there's really only three simple steps you need to follow. So in this video, I'm going to break down each one, starting with picking your million-dollar niche. You've probably heard people talk about how important it is to pick the right niche when starting an online business. But here's the thing, I see so many new creators following general advice like pick a niche, your passion about, or choose a trending topic, and while these are important, I found there's actually one thing you need to do first to make sure your niche is going to make you a bunch of money. And I call it pain targeting. It only takes an extra one to two minutes before picking a niche, but it is the exact reason why my one-person business has been able to produce results like this, this, and this. Basically, it's where you find a niche that targets a very specific pain point that millions of people are experiencing. This is because all business simply comes down to is solving problems for people. The bigger the problem you solve, the more money you get paid. That's why a CEO gets paid 150 per hour while their employees only make 20. The CEO solves much bigger problems in the company, therefore gets paid more. And it's the same for your one-person business. The bigger the problem you're able to solve for people, the more you're going to get paid. This is why back in 2020, when I picked my niche, I chose finance. Not only was I passionate about it, but I also knew that young people desperately want to learn how to make more money. It was a giant problem that millions of people around the world experienced. And I knew that if I could share honest and valuable information on how I was able to make money, then I would attract a loyal audience that I could eventually sell products to. And that's exactly what happened. By making content around the pain point, I was able to build my one-person business to $10,000 per month in just 12 months. So now let's break down exactly how you can pick a pain-solving niche to hopefully achieve similar results. Okay, so the first step I want you to do is open up a fresh Google Docs page and start writing down things you're passionate about. Or that you have skills in. This could be things like playing the guitar, going to the gym, playing video games, or baking. Then when you have a list of 10 to 20 things, start to go through your list and remove the ones that don't solve a big problem for millions of people. For example, origami is cool, but it doesn't solve a big problem for people. So it's probably not a great niche to get into, but something like going to the gym does, fitness solves massive problems like weight loss, more energy, or boosting self-confidence. Which means this would be a great potential niche. Then once you've narrowed down your list to three to five, you can come over to Google Trends and compare which niche is the most popular. I'm going to compare guitar, the gym, and gardening because all three solve big burning problems for people. And as you can see, guitar and gym completely smash gardening as trending niches in the past five years. So if I was picking a niche, I would go with one of these because not only do they solve a big problem, but they're also getting a lot of attention. The awesome thing is that not only does picking a pain-driven niche increase chances that you'll make money, but it also makes creating content around your niche so much easier. Which leads me to the next step, start posting value on social media and build a loyal audience with viral content. So once you picked your pain-solving niche, the next step to building a one-person business is to grow an audience that will buy your products. And honestly, I believe that this is one of the greatest opportunities of our generation. It's crazy to me that so many people are asleep to the fact that we are in one of the biggest economic shifts in history. For example, I love when Gary V said, the cost of starting a business or producing content in today's digital age is dramatically lower than it's ever been. Today, the barrier to entry is practically zero. Just 15 years ago, it required tens of thousands of dollars to start a business. Now, there's people like Dan Ko, who run a one-person business that makes $400,000 per month by simply posting content online. This is why I believe that if you've been thinking about starting an online business, you shouldn't wait much longer. More and more people are waking up to the opportunity and the competition is only going to increase. But I get it, posting content online can be scary, especially when you're stuck worrying about what your friends and family will think. And whether you're the type of person to make this business work, but don't worry, I'm going to share with you a five-step process that I believe is the fastest and easiest way to build an audience online. In fact, it's the reason I was able to go from zero to 10,000 followers in just two months when I first started. So the first step is to pick a short-form content platform. This is because it's much easier to make a simple 30-second video compared to creating a 15-minute long YouTube video. Plus, short-form content is where you're going to get the most attention because platforms like YouTube Shorts, TikTok and Instagram Reels have a much wider reach than long-form videos. Once you've picked a platform, the next step is to find the top three creators in your niche. For example, for me, I started on TikTok and used creators like Gary Vee and Graham Sethin as inspiration. What I would do is find their most popular videos, break down why they worked, and then copy the same format as them. But with my own unique twist. Here are some examples of videos I made at the beginning of my journey. Another thing to notice is how these videos are focused on solving people's pain points, which is one of the easiest ways to make content. You simply just pick one of the burning pain points in your niche and then explain how your audience can solve them. So I followed both these content strategies and stuck to a strict one to two videos per day schedule and was able to build my TikTok account to 100,000 followers in just one year. Then once your accounts start to take off, you can start to expand to other platforms like YouTube. But one question I get all the time is, but what if I don't want to show my face? Can I still make content and build a one-person business? And the answer to that is yes. In fact, in a moment, I'll explain exactly how you can make $10,000 per month without having to show your face. But first, let's talk about the next step. Creating a minimum viable offer, which is selling products. So once you picked a niche and you're building your audience, the last step and final step to building your one person business is to simply monetize your account. Now what most people immediately jump to is creating their own digital product. But here's why I think this is a terrible idea for beginners. Digital products can sometimes take months to create. Not only that, but you also need a landing page, equipment to film and expensive softwares, which can end up costing you hundreds or even thousands of dollars in the beginning. And this is all before you even know if your product is going to sell. That's why I recommend that beginner content creators actually start with affiliate marketing. Because that way you can test what products your audience wants to buy before you invest a bunch of time and money into creating your own product. Not only that, but if you make content that solves a problem for people and link your affiliate product as a solution, you can start making money straight away, even without a large following. But like I said before, what if you're the type of person that doesn't feel comfortable on camera? Well, don't stress because I've recently discovered a way you can build a one person affiliate marketing business to $10,000 a month without having to show your face. I call it faceless affiliate marketing. And it's helping my students like Jay make $11,000 in his first three months and Caleb, who's made $18,000 in just one month. Basically, how it works is you're going to create a Pinterest account and post images around the niche you've picked. For example, here are some images that I recommend you post. These posts are designed to grab your audience's attention so they click your link. So once you have your posts ready, next you want to create a simple website on Shopify that you can put all your affiliate links on. I recently developed a free AI affiliate website builder and this can create your website in just a few minutes using AI. So if you want to check that out, I'll link it in the description. A website is mandatory because you don't want to have links directly on Pinterest. Otherwise, your Pinterest account can get banned. So when someone clicks on your link from one of your images, they'll then land on your website. And when they buy one of your products you're promoting, you're going to start earning commissions. You'll also want to explore starting a blog. This is a great way to promote your affiliate products without ever having to show your face. I also suggest growing an email newsletter using Pinterest. My email newsletter generates over $10,000 per month just from promoting my affiliate products to my subscribers. But the secret to making this work is to find high paying affiliate links that pay between $50 and $100 per purchase. That way you'll make much more money per sale and eventually be able to use that money to scale your business with Pinterest ads. Now, if you want access to my personal vault of high paying affiliate links, plus a much more detailed guide on how to get started with Pinterest affiliate marketing, then I highly recommend that you check out my affiliate marketing course, which I'll leave linked in the description of this video. But if you want to learn more about my affiliate marketing strategy before you join the course, don't worry. I also have a completely free guide to creating your own Pinterest affiliate marketing business. The video is right here. I break down everything you need to know to get started. So you can still take advantage of this incredible opportunity for free.
