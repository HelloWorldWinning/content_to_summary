Description:
好的，我将根据内容进行提炼和总结。

**Summary:**

1.  **Core Idea:**
    *   The initial three minutes of meeting someone are crucial for shaping the future of the relationship. A positive first impression during this time can lead to a lasting positive relationship, while a negative one can lead to a negative one. Therefore, it's important to make a good first impression.

2.  **Outline:**
    *   **Importance of First Impression:** The first three minutes significantly impact relationship outcomes.
    *   **Positive vs. Negative:** Good first impression leads to a good long-term relationship; bad first impression leads to the opposite.
    *   **Actionable Advice:**  Avoid showing negative behavior at the start.

3.  **Core Point:** Making a positive first impression is critical for establishing successful long-term relationships.

4.  **Overarching Framework:** Cause and effect – first impressions cause long-term relational effects.

5.  **Mermaid Conceptual Map:**

        style First_Impression fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
        A[Positive Behavior] --> B(Good First Impression)
        C[Negative Behavior] --> D(Bad First Impression)
    end

    subgraph Long_Term_Relationship [Long-Term Relationship]
        style Long_Term_Relationship fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
        E(Positive Relationship)
        F(Negative Relationship)
    end

    B -- "Leads to" --> E
    D -- "Leads to" --> F

    style A fill:#aaffaa,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#aaffaa,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
