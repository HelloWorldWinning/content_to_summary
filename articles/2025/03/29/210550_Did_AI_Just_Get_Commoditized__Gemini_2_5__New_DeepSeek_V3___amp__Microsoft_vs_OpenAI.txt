Description:
好的，这是对所提供文本的核心观点提炼和总结，以简体中文呈现：

### **核心观点总结大纲**

1.  **引言：新模型密集发布**
    *   同一天发布了 Google Gemini 2.5 Pro 和 DeepSeek V3（同时提到了 OpenAI 的 GPT-4o Image Gen）。
    *   引发了对当前 AI 模型发展格局的思考。

2.  **Gemini 2.5 Pro 分析**
    *   **定位：** Google 称其为“最智能的 AI 模型”（但比直接宣称“全场最佳”更谦虚）。
    *   **基准测试表现：**
        *   在知识密集型测试（如 Humanity's Last Exam）上表现优异，知识储备丰富。
        *   在科学问题、多模态理解（MMU, Vista）上达到 SOTA 水平，尤其视觉理解接近人类水平。
        *   但在某些测试（如 Simplebench）上，其性能提升虽大，但与其他顶级模型（如 Claude 3.7, O3）处于相似水平，显示出趋同性。
        *   **突出优势：** 长上下文处理能力（100 万 token），远超竞品。
    *   **局限性/对比问题：** 基准测试方法不统一（如是否使用多数投票、是否报告所有分数）使得直接比较困难。

3.  **DeepSeek V3 分析**
    *   **定位：** 新的基础模型（非最终的 R2 推理模型），可类比为 GPT-4.5 之于 GPT-5。
    *   **基准测试表现：**
        *   与 OpenAI 的 GPT-4.5 相比，在数学、编程方面表现出色，甚至更好，在科学和常识方面略逊。
        *   **重要意义：** 这表明 DeepSeek（中国公司）的基础模型能力已与 OpenAI 的前沿基础模型水平相当，打破了 OpenAI 领先 6-12 个月的普遍认知，进一步印证了性能趋同。

4.  **核心论点：AI 能力的趋同与商品化**
    *   **微软 CEO Satya Nadella 的观点：** AI 模型正在被“商品化”，性能可以通过购买算力（如同商品）获得，OpenAI 等实验室更像是“产品公司”，并没有独占通往 AGI 的“秘密”。
    *   **证据 1 - 性能趋同：**
        *   尽管各家不断发布新模型，但在同等计算资源投入下，不同模型家族在各项能力（数学、科学、知识、编码）上的表现越来越接近。
        *   用户可能有偏爱的模型（如 O3 全能、Claude 3.7 风格好、DeepSeek 性价比高），但这更多是体验或特定场景的差异，而非绝对的智能鸿沟。
    *   **证据 2 - 微软内部进展（MAI）：**
        *   微软内部的 AI 团队（Mustafa Suleyman 领导）据称已能复现类似 O3 的推理能力，其 MAI 模型性能接近 OpenAI 和 Anthropic 的领先模型。这可能是 Nadella 宣称模型商品化的底气来源。
        *   Mustafa 与 OpenAI 就 O1 技术细节发生的争执，侧面反映了“秘密”的存在曾被重视，但现在可能已被追赶或破解。
    *   **证据 3 - Anthropic 的言行对比：**
        *   Anthropic CEO 预测 AI 将在短期内（12 个月）编写几乎所有代码，但公司仍在以高薪大量招聘软件工程师。
        *   同时，DeepSeek V3 在某些编码基准上已优于 Claude 3.7 Sonnet。这种言论与实际招聘行为、以及竞品的快速追赶之间的矛盾，削弱了其拥有绝对领先优势的可信度。

5.  **结论**
    *   新模型（如 Gemini 2.5 Pro）虽然强大且在特定领域（如长上下文、视觉理解）有突破，但整体趋势是顶级 AI 模型之间的性能差距正在缩小。
    *   AI 领域似乎正在进入一个“趋同”和“商品化”的阶段，算力投入成为提升性能的关键因素，单一机构难以长期维持绝对的技术护城河。

### **核心结论 (一句话)**

尽管顶级 AI 模型不断发布并取得进步，但它们之间的性能差距正显著缩小，表明 AI 能力正趋于**趋同**和**商品化**，难以维持独家技术壁垒。

---

### **内容总体框架**

该内容围绕着近期 AI 领域两大新模型（Gemini 2.5 Pro 和 DeepSeek V3）的发布展开，通过分析它们的性能、对比现有顶级模型（GPT-4o/O3, Claude 3.7 等），并结合行业领袖（特别是微软 CEO Satya Nadella）的观点以及其他佐证（微软内部进展、Anthropic 的言行），最终导向一个核心论点：**当前 AI 模型的发展呈现出明显的性能趋同趋势，支持了 AI 能力正在被商品化的观点，即通过投入足够算力就能达到相似的性能水平，所谓的“秘密武器”或技术护城河越来越难以维持。**

AGI he would say he's going to feel the AGI he would say he's going to feel the AGI on this new V3 and yes of course I'm on this new V3 and yes of course I'm on this new V3 and yes of course I'm aware that unless they're backed by the aware that unless they're backed by the aware that unless they're backed by the Chinese state and even then Deepseek Chinese state and even then Deepseek Chinese state and even then Deepseek might struggle to match the sheer might struggle to match the sheer might struggle to match the sheer compute of anthropic or open AAI but compute of anthropic or open AAI

there is for reasoning models no clear there is for reasoning models no clear moat before we finish then two more moat before we finish then two more moat before we finish then two more cheeky bits of evidence for the cheeky bits of evidence for the cheeky bits of evidence for the commoditization of AI commoditization commoditization of AI commoditization commoditization of AI commoditization here

differentiator at the moment is how much money you can funnel to getting much money you can funnel to getting much money you can funnel to getting more compute which then increments your more compute which then increments your more compute which then increments your benchmark performance now we have benchmark performance now we have benchmark performance now we have already talked about how Satiana has already talked about how Satiana has already talked about how Satiana has said that directly AI models are getting said that directly AI models are getting said that directly AI models are getting commoditized and as anyone who's watched commoditized and as anyone who's watched commoditized and as anyone who's watched this channel for a while you will know this channel for a while you will know this channel for a while you will know that that's a huge vibe shift from 2 that that's a huge vibe shift from 2 that that's a huge vibe shift from 2 years ago when he was celebrating the years ago when he was celebrating the years ago when he was celebrating the fact that he had this special fact that he had this special fact that he had this special partnership with OpenAI but a couple partnership with OpenAI but a couple partnership with OpenAI but a couple weeks back we got this insider report in weeks back we got this insider report in weeks back we got this insider report in the information which I couldn't find a the information which I couldn't find a the information which I couldn't find a chance to talk about on the channel but chance to talk about on the channel but chance to talk about on the channel but is really interesting there is a unit is really interesting there is a unit is really interesting there is a unit within Microsoft called Microsoft AI and within Microsoft called Microsoft AI and within Microsoft called Microsoft AI and it's run by this guy Mustafa Sulleon it's run by this guy Mustafa Sulleon it's run by this guy Mustafa Sulleon formerly the head of Inflection AI and formerly the head of Inflection AI and formerly the head of Inflection AI and before that the co-founder of Google before that the co-founder of Google before that the co-founder of Google DeepMind along with Dems as you might DeepMind along with Dems as you might DeepMind along with Dems as you might expect the Microsoft AI unit is also expect the Microsoft AI unit is also expect the Microsoft AI unit is also trying to fashion AGI but then last trying to fashion AGI but then last trying to fashion AGI but then last September they noticed 01 of course from September they noticed 01 of course from September they noticed 01 of course from OpenAI leap ahead and we all did mustafa OpenAI leap ahead and we all did mustafa OpenAI leap ahead and we all did mustafa Sulleon apparently called up and got Sulleon apparently called up and got Sulleon apparently called up and got very angry when OpenAI wouldn't tell him very angry when OpenAI wouldn't tell him very angry when OpenAI wouldn't tell him how they'd made it he started to raise how they'd made it he started to raise how they'd made it he started to raise his voice at Mirror Mirati apparently his voice at Mirror Mirati apparently his voice at Mirror Mirati apparently you're not holding up your end of the you're not holding up your end of the you're not holding up your end of the deal he said the call ended abruptly deal he said the call ended abruptly deal he said the call ended abruptly give us the documentation he demanded give us the documentation he demanded give us the documentation he demanded about how you had programmed 01 to think about how you had programmed 01 to think about how you had programmed 01 to think about user queries before answering now about user queries before answering now about user queries before answering now obviously that's a somewhat juicy story obviously that's a somewhat juicy story obviously that's a somewhat juicy story of the failing relationship between of the failing relationship between of the failing relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI but the real nugget Microsoft and OpenAI but the real nugget Microsoft and OpenAI but the real nugget comes later according to Microsoft at comes later according to Microsoft at comes later according to Microsoft at least they have figured it out how to do least they have figured it out how to do least they have figured it out how to do this kind of reasoning like Gemini and this kind of reasoning like Gemini and this kind of reasoning like Gemini and R1 and the rest of it Gro 3 and 03 and R1 and the rest of it Gro 3 and 03 and R1 and the rest of it Gro 3 and 03 and everyone seems to be reasoning now but everyone seems to be reasoning now but everyone seems to be reasoning now but so are Microsoft apparently and they so are Microsoft apparently and they so are Microsoft apparently and they claim that their MAI models now perform claim that their MAI models now perform claim that their MAI models now perform nearly as well as leading models from nearly as well as leading models from nearly as well as leading models from OpenAI and Anthropic on benchmarks their OpenAI and Anthropic on benchmarks their OpenAI and Anthropic on benchmarks their models of course also do this thinking models of course also do this thinking models of course also do this thinking before answering is that why Satia and before answering is that why Satia and before answering is that why Satia and Adella so confidently said that models Adella so confidently said that models Adella so confidently said that models are being commoditized if his own team are being commoditized if his own team are being commoditized if his own team is able to even partially replicate the is able to even partially replicate the is able to even partially replicate the performance of say 03 then that would performance of say 03 then that would performance of say 03 then that would indeed give him that confidence to say indeed give him that confidence to say indeed give him that confidence to say that now it's not like Microsoft needs that now it's not like Microsoft needs that now it's not like Microsoft needs to have the best model they are making a to have the best model they are making a to have the best model they are making a ton of money off AI in all sorts of ton of money off AI in all sorts of ton of money off AI in all sorts of directions for example did you know directions for example did you know directions for example did you know according to the 972 magazine sales of according to the 972 magazine sales of according to the 972 magazine sales of the company's cloud and AI services to the company's cloud and AI services to the company's cloud and AI services to the Israeli army have skyrocketed since the Israeli army have skyrocketed since the Israeli army have skyrocketed since the beginning of its onslaught on Gaza the beginning of its

live up to the hype if the MAI models live up to the hype if the MAI models live up to the hype but nevertheless the statement alone is but nevertheless the statement alone is but nevertheless the statement alone is noteworthy do you feel OpenAI is just a noteworthy do you feel OpenAI is just a noteworthy do you feel OpenAI is just a product company i think it's more than product company i think it's more than product company i think it's more than that but time will tell the final bit of that but time will tell the final bit of that but time will tell the final bit of cheeky evidence comes from again cheeky evidence comes from again cheeky evidence comes from again comparing Deepseek V3 the new one from comparing Deepseek V3 the new one from comparing Deepseek V3 the new one from today with Claude 3. 7 Sonnet as we know today with Claude 3. 7 Sonnet as we know today with Claude 3. 7 Sonnet as we know these are just five benchmarks out of these are just five benchmarks out of these are just five benchmarks out of the probably hundred or so out there now the probably hundred or so out there now the probably hundred or so out there now but just on say live codebench it but just on say live codebench it but just on say live codebench it outperforms 3. 7 sonnet and that comes outperforms 3. 7 sonnet and that comes outperforms 3. 7 sonnet and that comes just days after the CEO of Anthropic just days after the CEO of Anthropic just days after the CEO of Anthropic made this comment um what we are finding made this comment um what we are finding made this comment um what we are finding is we are not far from the world well I is we are not far from the world well I is we are not far from the world well I think we'll be there in 3 to 6 months think we'll be there in 3 to 6 months think we'll be there in 3 to 6 months where AI is writing 90% of the code and where AI is writing 90% of the code and where AI is writing 90% of the code and then in 12 months we may be in a world then in 12 months we may be in a world then in 12 months we may be in a world where AI is writing essentially all of where AI is writing essentially all of where AI is writing essentially all of the code but I must confess to noticing the code but I must confess to noticing the code but I must confess to noticing after I saw that rather dramatic and after I saw that rather dramatic and after I saw that rather dramatic and hypy comment that Anthropic are still hypy comment that Anthropic are still hypy comment that Anthropic are still advertising for software engineering advertising for software engineering advertising for software engineering roles in my hometown of London not only roles in my hometown of London not only roles in my hometown of London not only that they are advertising annual that they are advertising annual that they are advertising annual salaries of very generous proportions salaries of very generous proportions salaries of very generous proportions but wait if Claude four or five within but wait if Claude four or five within but wait if Claude four or five within 12 months is going to do quote all the 12 months is going to do quote all the 12 months is going to do quote all the coding then why even advertise an annual coding then why even advertise an annual coding then why even advertise an annual salary logically these people would be salary logically these people would be salary logically these people would be out of a job within a few months yes I'm out of a job within a few months yes I'm out of a job within a few months yes I'm being somewhat facitious because of being somewhat facitious because of being somewhat facitious because of course engineering is much more than course engineering is much more than course engineering is much more than just coding but still the words and the just coding but still the words and the just coding but still the words and the prediction don't quite match the prediction don't quite match the prediction don't quite match the recruitment intensity and for a family recruitment intensity and for a family recruitment intensity and for a family of models that is set to do quote all of models that is set to do quote all of models that is set to do quote all the coding it sure is struggling with a the coding it sure is struggling with a the coding it sure is struggling with a primary school age game in this case primary school age game in this case primary school age game in this case playing Pokémon endlessly getting stuck playing Pokémon endlessly getting stuck playing Pokémon endlessly getting stuck and resorting to hilarious means to and resorting to hilarious means to and resorting to hilarious means to progress and never quite doing so so progress and never quite doing so so progress and never quite doing so so that is my take on the new Gemini an that is my take on the new Gemini an that is my take on the new Gemini an amazing model but more proof of amazing model but more proof of amazing model but more proof of convergence than exceptionality of convergence than exceptionality of convergence than exceptionality of course very awkward for the Gemini team

Gen from OpenAI i decided to do two Gen from OpenAI i decided to do two Gen from OpenAI i decided to do two separate videos so let me know if you separate videos so let me know if you separate videos so let me know if you like that approach i thought it would like that approach i thought it would like that approach i thought it would just make it easier for you guys to just make it easier for you
