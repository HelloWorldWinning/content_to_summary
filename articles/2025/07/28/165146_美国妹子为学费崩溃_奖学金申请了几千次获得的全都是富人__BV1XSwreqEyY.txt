### **核心思想纲要**

**一、 对美国高等教育体系的控诉**
*   **无法承受的成本：** 美国大学，特别是专业学院（如法学院、牙医学院）的学费极其高昂，导致学生背负数十万甚至上百万美元的巨额债务。
*   **系统性不公：**
    *   奖学金体系被认为偏向富裕阶层（父母是医生、律师等），导致低收入家庭的学生在经济上处于绝对劣势。
    *   演讲者认为这是一种终身无法摆脱的“奴隶契约”，除非有贷款豁免计划，否则一辈子都无法还清债务。
*   **巨大的生存压力：** 为了应对学业和债务，学生不得不承担超负荷的学分（19-21学时）并同时从事多份低薪工作，即便如此也难以按时毕业和支付基本生活开销。

**二、 与中国体系的对比与向往**
*   **教育成本的巨大反差：** 演讲者了解到中国的大学学费极低（每年约650-800美元），与美国每年数万美元的费用形成鲜明对比，这让她感到极度愤怒和不公。
*   **社会精神面貌的差异（个人观察）：**
    *   通过社交媒体观察，她认为中国人看起来没有被生活压力“击垮”或“压碎”。
    *   她未观察到中国有人因医疗费用而在网上众筹，或普遍讨论因上大学而背负的巨额债务。
*   **最终选择：** 这种强烈的对比让她产生了逃离美国、移民到她认为更公平的社会的想法。

**三、 更广泛的社会批判**
*   **普遍的不公平感：** 演讲者将个人困境延伸至对整个美国社会体系的批判，认为它对普通人，特别是女性和低收入群体，是系统性不公平的。
*   **对未来的绝望：** 她对在美国实现和平、安宁的生活不抱希望，认为自己被剥削和压迫，最终的出路可能是离开这个国家。

### **核心观点**

由于无法承受的教育债务和普遍的社会不公，演讲者对美国体系感到极度愤怒和失望，并向往一个被其视为更公平的替代方案。

---

### **内容总体框架**

这是一个通过**个人经历与跨国对比，对美国社会经济体系进行情绪化的批判性分析**。演讲者以自身和身边同学的巨额学生债务为切入点，揭示了美国高等教育体系对普通人造成的巨大经济和精神压力，并通过与中国（一个被其理想化的对比对象）的对比，来强化对美国体系不公、不仁和令人绝望的控诉，最终表达了强烈的逃离意愿。

 I don't give two shits if people call me better for saying this. Why I'm hitting the blinds in thousands of fucking scholarships! But the only people who are getting the scholarships are the fucking rich people! Don't fucking rich people! Like your parents have money! Your parents are doctors! They're fucking lawyers! They're fucking judges! And you'll get millions of fucking dollars to go to college! Why you have all of these lower income people here looking at us like, what the fuck?! Asking dental students how much debt they're in! How much debt are you in? When I graduate, 450,000! How much debt are you in? Right now, like 210. How much debt are you in? I'd say out of pocket. How much debt are you in? A lot. How much is this problem? Like 300k out of it. I don't know. Like a million? How much debt are you in? Like 700,000. I'm chatting with a new friend in China and their law schools are $798 per year. Which just makes me feel so angry because I have like $450,000 in debt. Just to go to law school. And I'm explaining this extremely fucking bonkers system that we have. And I'm like, this is a slave contract because I'll never be able to pay back these loans for my entire life. Like I, or in my lifetime, I will never pay back my student loans without a loan forgiveness program. And they told me that China has public school for college. That's how much it is. Wrong. $650 American per year. I looked up the average price of one year of college in America. $30,000 is the middle for one year. And we have to go for four years for a degree. I'm moving to China. Are you kidding? No, because fuck you America for making me pay. For making me work for fucking jobs. For making me work for jobs. For making college. And for all the fucking Tennessee that can barely pay my own fucking rent. And I'm taking 19 credit hours on top of those poor fucking jobs. And I still can't graduate all the time. And I still can't graduate early even though I'm taking 21 credit hours next to master. It's not fucking fair. It's not fucking fair anymore. It's never been fair not in my lifetime. And will it ever be fair? No, because I'm a woman in America. Oh my God. I just want to live in peace America. And I will one day. Probably somewhere fucking else. Anyways, look how cute my nails are. After being on red note for a little less than a week now. I have to say I've noticed some huge, huge differences between American social media and Chinese social media. I have to say one of the biggest changes that I've noticed is the fact that the Chinese people don't look just absolutely defeated. Like they don't look like pressure from everything is just crushing them. I've noticed that I don't see any of them starting GoFundMe pages to pay for their medical bills. I've noticed that I don't see any of them talking about the tens of thousands or a hundred thousand dollars in debt that they're in because they wanted to go to college and get an education. Today's video was dataset. They sent us the letter squarely against us and Monday was deported. So yesterday they went on the trophy that caused us to get obligations and also his family. That one was not the album.
