**文本核心思想总结**

本文采访麻省理工学院的吉姆·沃尔什博士，深入分析了近期对伊朗核设施（特别是福尔多）的军事打击及其潜在影响。讨论围绕袭击的技术效果、伊朗的核能力、袭击对伊朗政治决定的影响以及国际核不扩散机制面临的挑战展开。

**结构化摘要:**

1.  **引言**: 介绍嘉宾沃尔什博士及其在核事务领域的经验，引出对伊朗核设施遭袭的讨论。
2.  **袭击的技术评估**:
    *   袭击目标：福尔多核设施，使用地堡破坏弹。
    *   效果不确定性：无法进入现场，撞击深度和效果难以准确评估。尽管IAEA总干事报告离心机可能被毁，但离心机本身脆弱，且伊朗正在清理修复。
    *   关键问题：400公斤60%浓缩铀的下落是核心关切，其潜在威胁远超设施破坏。
3.  **伊朗的核能力与应对**:
    *   掌握关键技术：伊朗已掌握制造裂变材料（高浓缩铀）这一最困难环节。
    *   快速恢复潜力：即使袭击“完美”摧毁当前设施，伊朗凭借成熟计划、现有储备（离心机、零件）和人才，仍可在2-5年内重建能力。
    *   隐藏能力强大：高浓缩铀容易隐藏，卫星追踪和检查面临巨大挑战（“藏匿者”相对于“猎人”拥有优势），伊朗很可能已转移材料至秘密设施。
4.  **袭击的政治影响**:
    *   核心风险：袭击最大的风险在于可能促使伊朗做出此前18年未做的政治决定——主动追求制造核武器。
    *   强硬派抬头：袭击和伊朗核科学家的遇刺削弱了温和派，使“保持克制”变得异常困难，促使伊朗倾向“以强对强”。
5.  **国际核不扩散机制的挑战与担忧**:
    *   机制脆弱性：现有的不扩散机制并非设计来应对针对核设施的军事打击，此类袭击违反多项国际法。
    *   沃尔什博士的担忧：袭击可能导致中东地区出现拥核的伊朗（已有拥核的以色列），军控机制衰退，世界变得更加危险。特朗普政府的短期主义加剧了这一风险。
6.  **外交的可能性与障碍**:
    *   技术可行性：伊朗曾表示愿转移高浓缩铀（通过稀释或运出）——技术上可行且不难。
    *   政治障碍：袭击极大地降低了通过外交恢复类似JCPOA（伊核协议）的可能性。
7.  **核武器的普遍危险与未来展望**:
    *   长期风险：区域核冲突可能导致气候灾难，危及人类文明。现有拥核国家着眼短期安全，忽视长期累积的危险。
    *   扭转方向的必要性：虽然过去有裁减核武和达成条约的成功经验，但目前趋势危险，需要所有国家立即采取行动扭转。
    *   解决难点：对缺乏国际联系、感到受威胁的国家（朝鲜、伊朗、以色列）尤其困难，需要大国（中美俄欧）的合作和认真对待核裁军。

**核心观点总结**:

攻击伊朗核设施未能根除其核能力，反而可能在政治上促使伊朗下定决心制造核武器，从而加剧地区和全球的核扩散风险，使世界变得更加危险。

**总体框架**:

本文的总体框架是分析对伊朗核设施的军事打击（特定事件）在更广泛的国际核不扩散背景下，其技术效果与政治影响的对比，探讨军事行动的意外后果以及对全球安全的长期风险，实质是对通过军事手段而非外交手段应对核扩散风险的有效性和后果的讨论。

 Hey everyone, thank you for tuning in. And I'm not so excited because I'm about to talk with someone on a highly respect and admire. Dr. Jim Walsh, Senior Research Associate at MIT is one of the few Americans being to not only Ron but DPRK, negotiating nuclear affairs with their officials. Thank you for being here, Dr. Walsh. It's my pleasure, happy to be here. First question is, do you guys think bombing a Iranian nuclear facility is namely Nantans, Isfhan and most eyeball grabbing fordow? Seven B2 bombers carrying 14 GBU-57 bunker buster, tagged the 45 uranium enrichment site, hidden at least 16 meters deep in mountains cover but here I quote President Trump, granted concrete and steel. Seven days later, we're still puzzled by conflicting reports. How do you assess the impact of the bombing on fordow? There are two questions here really. One is, what was the impact on fordow? And then the second is, what impact does that have on Iran's ability to build nuclear weapons? So let's take the narrower question first. What is the likely impact on fordow? We don't really know because no one has access to the site. The US dropped several of these bunker busters. First time they had been used, the US actually used quite a big share of its total arsenal, but it's the first time the weapon's been used. Presumably it's been tested, but this is the real world and sometimes things don't go according to the test. But the other thing to keep in mind is that whatever the effectiveness of the bunker buster in trying to burrow deeper to get to the centrifuges in the mountain, it's important to remember that centrifuges are fragile creatures. They break constantly, especially older versions of them. And so it's a delicate machinery. And so it doesn't really require that much to make them inoperable. So I think right now we just don't know, Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, reported yesterday that he thought the centrifuges is a little under 3,000 centrifuges there were probably destroyed. But that does not answer the question. Iran's nuclear weapons capability today and what will its policy be going forward? Will they make a decision, a decision they had not previously made to now, pursue nuclear weapons, having been attacked? And they are both for Fordo and Iran's ability. One of the critical questions is, what happened to the 400 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium? Because no one would do this, but you could probably make a crude bomb just with that. It really wouldn't be very usable. But they are, if they have 400 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium and they had removed it, if they removed it from Fordo, which you'd think they'd probably do after all the threats. And there's other evidence that perhaps indicates that they did. Then they have that hidden somewhere. And so their ability to produce nuclear weapons, they would be able to do it very, very quickly. Let's say it takes a year for weaponization, so maybe two years, something like that, less than two years. Now let's assume, instead, that this attack was perfect. That is to say, the type of military attack that actually never happens in the real world, where everything goes right. Let's say they got all the centrifuges and all the 60% and 20% enriched uranium. How long would it take them to rebuild? And I'm going to say two to five years. This is not really accomplishing anything. Why do I say that? They destroyed all this equipment, right? Well, you know, won't this make it so difficult? No, it's not going to be difficult for them. To begin with, I'm pretty sure they have centrifuges and centrifuge parts in reserve, hidden elsewhere in the country. I think that's a very high likelihood. And let's face it, this is a mature civilian enrichment program. It's been around for 18 years. 18 years ago, the US national intelligence community issued an official assessment saying that Iran in 2007 had a technical capability to build the bomb. What was lacking was the political decision to do so. So this is an 18-year-old program. They've built tens of thousands of centrifuges, enriched thousands of kilograms of nuclear material, big program, lots of personnel. You lose it. You know, 10, 20 scientists. It does not matter. The results of this attack, under perfect conditions, is that we've really run the risk now that Iran has done something it hasn't done, which is to say, oh, yeah, we'll show you, you've put us in this terrible place. We're going for it. We haven't gone for it for 18 years, 18 years. We have stayed below that line. Now you've attacked us and we're going to cross the line. If that's the case, and it's probably more than 50-50 and we can discuss why. If that's the case, then they'll have a bomb within five years. And the fact that it's one year or two years or five does not really matter. I've been checking in Mexico for like a week and latest satellite images show Iranian-cleaning in debris and repairing areas, reportedly, GB was struck. People have been saying, oh, it's maybe a haul for the centrifuge. Some others like the DOD saying they're attacking ventilation shafts. Why would U.S. Air Force dropping bombs aren't ventilating shafts instead of maybe more important parts? Well, the reason to go for the shaft is it's an entryway down into the underground facility. So if you start with a shaft that goes down, the missile is going to go through that. So it's that much less concrete steel and dirt it has to plow through before it hits some barrier than it explodes and then it creates effects from that point forward. Well, interestingly, I sent you an NPR article that corresponded to them saying using existing penetration equation, you got the result saying if the bomb is dropping on silty clay, the penetrates like 80 meters. But if on medium-strance rock like sedimentary limestone or dolomite, the long penetrates like 8 meters, like 25 feet, they're long like granite, which Trump is saying is a concrete steel and granite. How do you comment on his speech together with the equation reported by NPR? First thing to remember is that if we're trying to answer this specific question like how far down did it go? Keep in mind two things. One, it was repeated bombing. So it was bunker buster hitting then the next bunker buster, then the next bunker buster. But again, the other thing to keep in mind is the bomb doesn't have to reach all the way to the bottom in order to have a destructive effect because again, these are very fragile, the centrifuge piece of it. They're very fragile pieces of equipment. The way that Israel used to attack Iran's centrifuge facilities was not the centrifuges themselves. That's in this last attack too. As to take out the electrical generating facilities that supplied power to the centrifuges because even cutting off the power abruptly is enough to sort of cause a thing to break down. And once it starts to break down, it rapidly collapses. And if you have a centrifuge cascade and there are all these long tubes that are all together in sets, if one of them starts to go wobbly and sort of explodes or disassembles, it's going to affect all the others in the cascade that are physically nearby. But I would back it up a little and say, do they still have their 60% highly enriched uranium? The whole deal here when you're trying to make a nuclear weapon, the most difficult, the most physically challenging part of the entire enterprise is producing fissile material, whether that's highly enriched uranium or plutonium, that is the essence of the bomb. Once you do that, there are other difficult challenges, but they're not nearly as difficult as that. So Iran has mastered the most difficult part of the process and has done it for almost two decades. One of the presumptions we should have is there are two things that could happen here. We'll never know what the state of Fordeaux is because Iran pulls out of IAEA, pulls out of the NPT, kicks out its inspectors, and never lets anyone back in that facility. We just may never know. Under those conditions, my presumption is that the centrifuges were damaged. Maybe some of them survived, but then they'd sort of have to excavate them out of the hole as it were, and that's going to be hard. But it doesn't really matter because I'm sure they have centrifuge and centrifuge parts. I'm sure they do. That's one scenario where no one knows because no one's let into the facility. But my best guess is there was damage to the centrifuges, to some 50% or more, let's say. They're the only ones with access to the site. So ultimately, they're the only ones who can answer that question. And then the other possibilities, they do let people in. If they moved that 60% enriched material, which is what the centrifuges are just a path to get the material. So they had the material. And if they moved it, then I think they have a strong incentive for saying, well, this whole thing's destroyed. We're going to close it up and never give access again to anyone. And yes, our 60% enriched uranium was also destroyed. That's what I'd say. If I was in their shoes, I would have moved it out. And if the facility would have been destroyed, then I would say no access. And by the way, all that material is gone. Meanwhile, I would have moved it to a secret facility and started to make nuclear weapons. So those are sort of the choices we're looking at here. So IEA reports being suggesting they have a secret basis. So we all know they have a secret one. We have satellite images showing trucks like 70 something trucks transferring on the one cargo to somewhere on the one. Maybe intelligence though, but there's no leak right now. So we're waiting technically, how could they transfer, let's say, 400 kg of uranium? Because I've never been, you know, doing it. It's not a big deal. It's there. I mean, it's not nominated into the cap. I'm sorry. It's not hard to do. It's denominated into casks and it's not very radioactive. It's very transportable. And it doesn't really pose safety challenge to people who are carrying it. And it's not going to blow up on its own. You know, in spontaneous fission. So not really a challenge there. I also saw a picture of those trucks. There are different reports about that conga line of convoy trucks that were out in front back on June 13th, whatever it was. Some people say what they were doing was dumping dirt on Fordo to reinforce the barrier, to make it more resistant to a bombing. Some people suggest that they were doing it to be able to transport the enriched uranium they already had, the 60 percent enriched. I mean, I think it's hard to say there's no reason why they couldn't be doing both. There's no reason why they couldn't have removed the 60 percent earlier. On this issue of secret facilities, this came out after the last IAEA board meeting when I'm sure what the IAEA board of governors now regrets in retrospect when they voted to censure Iran, making it easier for Israel to attack, I think, politically. I don't think they were anticipating that. But in any case, in that run up to the Israeli strike when an IAEA censured Iran, the head of Iran's atomic energy organization, the AEOI, may reference to secret facilities. And Grosie's response was implied that, yeah, they knew there were secret facilities and that one had been under construction for years. Now one of the big unknowns here in this whole thing is we don't know what Israel bombed. They're not telling us everything they bombed and Iran is not telling us everything they bombed. Now it is certainly likely that some, like the secret facility referred to by the head of the atomic energy organization of Iran, that was one where again they were burying it in a mountain and then there had been years of excavation, right? But you can store a canister of H.E.U. in an apartment in downtown Tehran and it would be impossible to find. So I'm sure there are secret facilities that Iran has started, right? Real intended to be secret, but not so secret because we already know that they're building them. That's one set. And some of those were probably attacked during the bombing. And there's probably another set of secret facilities that Iran knows about that Israel and the U.S. doesn't know about. There's a lot that favors the HIDR. There are these models, attack or HIDR that you see in security studies, you know, who's going to win the race between someone trying to find something? I guess it's really the hunter, the hunter and the HIDR. If Iran is prepared and put its mind to it and it had months, you know, it had been morning since May, it was taking precautionary actions. If it had time, it would be the HIDR almost always wins because you overwhelm the seeker, the hunter with decoys. And they only have so much intelligence assets and they can't chase everything and it sort of gets lost. And so I can move these when someone's trying to make a pickup of a ransom and gets lost in a crowd. The HIDR has brutal advantages here. So we don't know. It's early days, but I would say it's more likely than not that they already have enriched material hidden somewhere. Seems like an endless whack-a-mo game. Exactly. Exactly. So many scholars found technical barrier people being counting on to achieve MPT like guess interviews, not causing that much trouble to Iran or DPRK at all. Like your colleague Professor Scott Camp argued, the non-polarification emperor has no clothes. Some suggested counting on public opposition, actually, MIT, New York Times, God and multiple opats, lambasting the bombing, say in my weekend Iranian U.S. lovers. So Dr. Walsh, you've been to Iran and North Korea. What do you have to say here? Of course, I know Scott Campy's a colleague and a friend. He may be exaggerating things a bit. But in general, that is to say it is hard to find centrifuges. It is because they don't give off a lot of heat and they don't use a lot of electricity. And so there aren't a lot of signals to follow. But in the main, that problem is less difficult under normal conditions. The problem is we're not under normal conditions, right? A country's been attacked. They may be actively seeking to hide and then build a program under intense pressure. So that's not the sort of thing the non-polaration regime is built for, in part because you're not supposed to go and bomb countries nuclear facilities, right? This broke like 15 different international laws to do this. Humanitarian laws of war and laws regarding nuclear facilities. That's where we're at. And so I guess I'm more worried about this. Do I think the non-polaration regime, which I support, I don't think anyone should have nuclear weapons and that includes the nuclear weapon states and that includes the United States. I don't think I think there are danger to us all and we're kidding ourselves if we think they'll never be used. And that'll cause a climate disaster that could threaten civilization. So I don't think any of this is good. I got to say though, the thing my chief worry about this coming out of this is someone who has spent 20 years on this, has studied nuclear decision making, studied nuclear decision making in Iran in particular, met with the Iranian president every year for 20 years. I feel that Trump does this, then he goes like this, walks away from it, look, this was great, because he's not interested in really results. He doesn't care what happens five years from now. He just doesn't want to, he's doing things that he thinks benefits him today. So he'll be gone, but five years from now we'll have a nuclear armed Israel. Let you know, everyone seems to forget that Israel has nuclear weapons and has had them since 1967. We'll have a nuclear armed Israel and we're going to have a nuclear armed Iran and we're going to be in a much more dangerous world, much more dangerous. Now that may also have the effect along with a bunch of other stuff that's happening in the world today and Trump is contributing to this, a decline in the non-proliferation regime, a decline in arms control, everyone for themselves and that's going to be a very dangerous place unless something happens. We do something, someone does something to put us on a different course. That's what I fear is we're going to have two weapons states in the Middle East who are angry with each other, who are threatening each other, whatever happens from there is not going to be good. Well, maybe it's a good news because Iran ambassador to the UN just expressed willingness transferring highly concentrated uranium out of country for yellow cakes in return. Are we talking about stage denuclearization or nuclear disarmament here? I'm glad you asked this question because as we focus like this on the bombing of everything in the last month, it's easy to forget that the choice Israel made followed by the US to bomb Iran, which I believe may push Iran towards developing nuclear weapons, the politics of it. It didn't have to be that way. For 18 years, that Iran did not act on its nuclear weapons capability and for a good piece of that, there was an international agreement, a Iran nuclear agreement. We had lots of inspectors on the ground and everyone had confidence that people were abiding by their obligations. Every intelligence community in the world, even Israel said Iran was following the agreement and that was great. That put us in a much safer position than Trump comes in and tears it up because he didn't do it and he doesn't respect anything that other people do. So he just tore it up, putting this on a path to the military action we saw this month. The ideal situation would be to get back to an agreement. If Iran wants to negotiate an agreement, the 60 percent uranium was never a technically challenging thing. In the first, and so, you know, main only Iran nuclear agreement that Trump ripped up, they had had a highly enriched uranium at 20 percent and higher levels. And so the agreement said fine, we'll just blend it down, right? You have whole milk, you pour in some 1 percent and you blend it down to 2 percent milk. That is what we're talking about. This is not technically challenging. The reason, just because 60 percent enriched uranium is important does not mean it's technically hard to deal with. It's not hard to deal with at all. You just blend it down and or you could ship it outside. But I think Iran has always preferred to blend down rather than to ship its own produced material to another country unless it was waste. But if Iran is open to that, man, I would love that. I would welcome an agreement. But there are reasons why I don't think that's going to happen. And that is all those folks who have been saying let's negotiate, let's not cross the nuclear threshold, all those people sitting in those meetings, they don't have any power anymore. The ones who have been complaining that Iran is being taken advantage of and we need to meet strength with strength and Israel as a bully, all those people who were sitting at the table minus some of the people who were assassinated, right? Some of their colleagues who would normally be sitting at that decision table are dead having been assassinated. So they're meeting in a room deciding what to do. Do we go for the bomb or do we continue restraint? Well, I think restraint is going to be a very difficult cell, very, very difficult cell under conditions where the country was attacked and your colleagues are dead. There's more and more science that shows even regional nuclear conflicts might produce climate changes that could threaten human civilization as we know it. And every day, every country with nuclear weapons says, well, this is helping me today. It's defending me against my enemy. And so I'm not going to let go. And then another day passes and another day passes and they keep looking to the short term one day at a time. Well, when you do that, the day comes when there is a nuclear war and we're talking, you know, a hundred years, a hundred years from now, who knows who's going to hate who and who's going to be in a conflict with him. But if we keep doing this, if we keep building and we're on the verge of building more and I understand, you know, some people say, well, this country has more than I do and I have to catch up. I get it. But that is the road to human destruction. And we're seeing it play out in the Middle East right now. But even before that, all the weapons states, France, Israel, Britain, China, India, Pakistan, the United States, they're all part of the problem here. And once we turn this thing around, we're facing terrible, terrible times. And we can do it. We have success in the past. In the past, we've dismantled tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. All right. It's not a physical problem. We know how to take them apart. We've done it. We've passed major treaties that stopped and restricted nuclear arms. But today we are moving in a different direction. And if we keep going down this direction, there is trouble ahead. And we have to do something about it now because it only gets harder the longer we wait. And that applies to all the countries that own nuclear weapons today and the ones that may have them tomorrow. Well, I guess it's tough problem. Countries that have limited relationships with the international community like North Korea and states that feel they have made enemies of the superpowers like Iran and states for which they think their existence is at stake. Yeah. And I think North Korea is the best example of that. It's the weakest state vulnerable to it has a hostile relationship with its major enemy, which is much more powerful. South Korea is much more powerful. I think ultimately North Korea will be the toughest nut to crack of all of them. But if the great powers get in line, you know, China, Russia, the US, Europe, Israel will also be difficult. If they want to take the initiative, then they can create conditions where North Korea sees a way forward that doesn't involve nuclear weapons. The thing is that the big powers are always blaming the little powers and saying, well, you can't have yours, but I get to keep mine. This only works if everyone is serious about trying to reduce the total number because the other states, the little states are going to say, what do you, you know, they're never going to agree or they'll rarely go along and agree where they put themselves in jeopardy and the others just get to skate by. Either everyone gets serious about this or it doesn't happen. At least we're doing this to expose fake news, publics, demagogues, fisting up people's fears in World War III is coming and laying rock solid knowledge foundation for fruitful public discussion later. Thank you, Dr. Walsh again for your time and brilliant analysis. Thank you, happy to be here.
