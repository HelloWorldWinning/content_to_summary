Description:
好的，这是根据您提供的文本提取的核心思想、总结、核心要点、总体框架以及美人鱼概念图：

**华尔街工作分析**

**Summary Requirement 1: Structured Outline Summary**

以下是根据文本内容提炼并结构化的华尔街工作核心思想摘要：

**I. 华尔街的本质与环境**
    A. 核心驱动力：金钱与利润是衡量成功的唯一底线。
    B. 极度高压与紧张：工作环境充满巨大压力，每时每刻都有压力，并非所有人都能适应或生存。
    C. 竞争激烈：行业人才济济，竞争残酷，需要竭尽全力保持领先。

**II. 华尔街的文化与挑战**
    A. “弱肉强食”（Eat What You Kill）文化：强调个人业绩和盈利能力，感觉像在狩猎。
    B. 风险与波动性：市场变化迅速且难以预测，工作充满高风险，尤其做空可能面临无限损失。
    C. 性别挑战：作为女性，有时可能因外表而不被认真对待，仍存在“男性网络”感。
    D. 幸灾乐祸（Schadenfreude）：即使在所谓的朋友之间，也可能对他人的失败感到一丝喜悦。
    E. 短期焦点：有时过于关注眼前，缺乏长期视角（被比作短跑而非马拉松）。
    F. 不断证明自己：需要持续取得成就来证明自身价值。

**III. 成功的要素与所需特质**
    A. 能力至上（Meritocracy）：背景不重要，关键在于能否赚钱和贡献盈利想法。
    B. 所需特质：需要极强的韧性、纪律、专注、无畏、有时甚至需要“千里眼”般的市场洞察力。
    C. 勤奋与投入：需要长时间工作，甚至感觉是24小时全天候工作。

**IV. 华尔街的主要活动与角色**
    A. 交易：包括股票交易（长短仓）、日内交易，基于图表、数据或市场解读进行决策。
    B. 资产管理与基金管理：管理机构和高净值客户的资金，构建基金，设定策略（如对冲基金的杠杆与做空）。
    C. 研究与分析：分析公司（如生物技术、消费品），为交易决策提供支持。
    D. 募资与交易执行：帮助企业融资，处理交易的后台工作。
    E. 发现与培养人才：寻找有潜力但未被发现的经理人。

**V. 华尔街的象征意义与目标**
    A. 全球金融中心：不仅仅是一条街，更是全球最大的金融市场象征。
    B. 人才“熔炉”：汇聚来自不同背景的人才。
    C. 追求金钱与财务自由：核心目标是赚钱，以便实现如提前退休的财务自由。
    D. 短卖的公共价值：有助于发现公司隐藏信息，促进市场健康透明（尽管存在负面形象）。
    E. 工作热情：一些人对市场和交易本身充满热情。

**VI. 个人视角**
    A. 从不同背景进入（如出租车司机、法学专业）。
    B. 对比：有人更愿意做实际创造产品的公司，而非预测市场的分析师。
    C. 需要多元化的精神食粮：工作内容可能单一，需要通过其他兴趣（如量子物理）扩展思维。

**Summary Requirement 2: Core Point in One Sentence**

**华尔街是一个以金钱和绩效为唯一衡量标准、充满巨大压力和风险的环境，要求从业者具备极强的韧性、纪律和市场洞察力才能生存并实现盈利。**

**Summary Requirement 3: Overarching Framework**

 The Wall Street takes the brightest people and smashes them into the pavement on a regular basis. There's only one bottom line, one Wall Street, and that bottom line is how much money you make. This is one of the most stressful jobs on earth. We have stress every single second. Not everybody can survive. Air against, lead, corruption, those are all trapped when you work on Wall Street. Whatever your background was, it's can you make money, can you contribute to profitable ideas? You should wake up in the morning with an immediate feeling of dread no matter what. And that is simply because if you know what you're doing, you realize that it might be very, very fleeting. Being a woman on Wall Street, I think it has good parts and bad parts. Oftentimes you still feel it's a little bit of a voice network. Sometimes you're not being taken as seriously because you know you wear a skirt and makeup. There's a two major things in this business how to make money in Wall Street. The first of all is my new own business and the second was important thing discipline. A lot of our clients look to us to make the money but also to be something of an insurance policy if the market really gets nasty. Yesterday the market was nasty and we had a very good day. There are two numbers I don't think I'll forget. One is 15 and that is the age I moved out of my parents' house. And the other is 27 and that's the age I retired in. It's about making money but you have to have discipline, you have to be clairvoyant, you have to be obsessed and fearless. When Guy was managing money in a loft in Soho, he was knocking it out of the park and no one knew he existed. And now he has an office in a midtown high rise and his performance has been off the charts, putting him in the top 5% of managers. We are investors in US equities only and we are a long short fund which means that we are basically making bets if you will on stock prices going up and stock prices going down. We trade for both our personal equity as well as that of both institutional and high net worth investors. Alright, we got a lot of money to put to work so we're going to put some of it to work today. I have always worked on getting one degree up on another to show that I'm actually well accomplished. I did feel under pressure to prove that. You have to have a certain resilience for Wall Street. Get stressful here usually around the open which is at 9.30 Eastern time. There's usually some information that has come to light overnight. Thank you. How you chill? What? You're going to be good in school today? Yes. You're sure? Yes. And what are you going to do? A little more. A little more. You want to be like video, did they trade it? Yeah, I don't want to get $2. You want a million dollars? Yes. That's a good one. How about 2 million? Oh, that's 5 million. 5 million, okay. But you know what needs to be done in order to make this kind of money, right? Um, I'm saying it's cake. It's actually very simple. You got to start in a high school, have a good rate, and then try to go to college. And then hopefully you know you're going to get a good job and then work long hours. And then you're going to be better than anybody else. It's the same as in trading with the day to do. Alex came to the country about 10 years ago and he had a degree in finance from Moscow. His dream was to work on Wall Street. And he found out very early on that his degree wasn't worth anything in the US. He felt that he could beat the market. Seven years later and no losing months, he is on his way to becoming a star. Oh, it's right here. It's right here. It's like a show. Oh my God. There's a cliche you eat what you kill. And that's very much the culture of Wall Street. Waking off and feeling like you're on a hunt. I work for an asset management company that has about $6 billion under management. I have to be at work at 8 o'clock and be pretty much bright item bushy tail because I cover European markets. By the time that I get to the office, they just come back from their lunch break. Hey Christina. The coffee machine has gone whack out. You'll find no quarter in the coffee machine. My title? Yeah. President, we're not big on titles here. Parker is a, he runs the show and then Mike is an analyst and so pretty much anything Parker once done, I execute. I analyze primarily biotech companies that research and develop pharmaceuticals. Mike, yeah. You got a second on IRB as a hedge fund. We can do things that your traditional mutual fund can't do. We can use leverage if we want to. Add a dollar. I mean, also we can short sell, which means you are betting on the security price going down. Hey Christina, short $10,000. Can you please short sell $10,000 for me? The risks associated with a short are much higher. If you go in short $100 stock, the most you can make is $100 and the most you can lose is infinite. So it's a little bit more intense emotionally and that's why a lot of people don't like the business. Technically Wall Street is a street down in southern Manhattan on the corner of Wall Street and Broad is the New York Stock Exchange. But what is Wall Street in the more figurative sense? It's the biggest financial market in the world. The siren song of money can get so alluring. It's highly competitive with extraordinarily intelligent people. There's a lot of competition and you need to do everything to stay ahead of the pack. Out of 21 months we've had one down month and we would like to not have any more down months. For me, this is a 24 hours a day job. I cannot come home, set them my wife. This month I did not make money. I'm here to make money. Let's be real straight about this. It's the Holy Grail. How do you take the lowest risk and get the highest return out of it? We're here at the American Stock Exchange where in 1987 as everyone knows the market crashed. On that Monday afternoon as I was standing doing my job in one of the trading pits you see below me, one of the brokers who was trying to get the attention of another broker actually bit me in the shoulder because I was in his way. I stood there stunned. That's a true story. It's one of the hardest things for me to explain what I do. I represent on one side some of the richest investors on the planet. On the other side we try to find undiscovered managers who we hope will be the next superstar. It's an art discovering some of these managers because for the most part they like to remain below the radar. I would say nine out of ten are going to fail. This is all we got so far that we've got over on the short side. That's not enough. No. I basically sit down with my trader and we go through what do we have in the book and what do we think we're going to need to do today? Do we want to add to positions? Do we want to cut positions? We want to wait on these two, right? We want to wait for them to open and to stabilize. It's a tempting target but we've been burned too badly on those. Alright let's hold both of those over. It is a no go for the moment. Now here on the other hand check our stock loan on that and see whether or not. Can't? No. They have two exposure. That's fine. It's always something. There's a lot of risk in the market right now. So we're going to be very, very careful about what we do. If I can talk to trading, to bear, to guide them as I'm doing it as well. The way to do it is I want us to open and stabilize. We've got two minutes. You've got enough bid here for the time being. We can ease our way into all of it. The market's open. What's going to happen is you're going to have a flood of orders. Anybody was short yesterday and thought they were going to get followed through and might be nervous. What you end up with is a very funky move in the very beginning of the day. You see that reprice right now? It's all over the place. You want to get in and get those positions on. It's in the flat line right now. When Gee's working on a trade, you'll never get his attention. I mean he just has laser focus and he'll remain in these positions until he takes his pound to flesh out of the market. Hold him? Hold him. Okay. All retiring means is that you don't have to work. No, that's 100 points. And the secret to that is creating enough assets for you to support yourself. I worked at a consumer sector focused hedge fund. I love to meet with the management of the companies, build financial models, analyze their businesses and pick stocks. Okay, I'm going to get them both. Strong. Right now I'm in the process of starting my own hedge fund. To start a hedge fund there's a lot of things that have to happen. You have to have a strategy and you basically have to build a team before you're in business. Day one an investor gives you money. They expect you to start performing. Day two. Another guy resigned. The board asked the primary CEO. The mad scientist. The mad scientist. Right now we are pausing on acting because we're worried about the new guy's resignation. Okay, I'll tell you my big pet peeve. It's like when you are a company and you're trying so hard to let's say you're making a product and then you see how all the analysts are betting on whether or not the company is going to do right or wrong. I'd rather be the company who's actually making something than being the weasily analyst who's actually predicting whether or not something's going from A to B. I don't want to say weasily. Okay, maybe take out weasily. But sometimes I feel that it's more honest to be the, honest is not the great wordy. Let's scratch all that. Scratch, scratch. I'd rather be the person who's actually making it happen versus you betting whether or not something's going to go up or down. There's a nefarious image that short sellers are betting on destruction and loss of wealth and we don't want to have people profiting from other people's loss. There's some countries that don't allow short selling. France, you can't short sell in France. I think that's really short-sighted. Short selling serves a really important public purpose. Short sellers are often ferreting out information that companies are trying to hide. It's a deal with F-ing off in the late filing. It's just they're slow. Who's the CFO there? And you think he's confident? A healthy market is one where information is broadly disseminated and honestly disseminated. There's a shade in Freud also to Wall Street and even among so-called France. It's only the Germans could really come up with this word. It's the joy and revelement of seeing somebody else fail. This is Sandra. Could I just go to Carl from a German client all in a second place? Can you see a spade at Silicon? I was born in Germany in a small town, middle-class family. As the daughter of an Iranian father and German mother. Dan Kishun. Mr. Peter. Nothing ever indicated that I would actually make it to New York City down the road because it's really a long shot especially considering that I studied law. But it was always my dream to one day make it to the United States. You know the morning passes very quickly. I get a lot of phone calls, emails. Most of them I tend to answer right away, try to get them out of the way. We want to be able to increase or leverage a little more aggressive. I help make deals. We raise capital from primarily institutional investors and then we structure funds, put that money in there and we manage it for them. A fund is kind of a shell of where the securities are being put into. I mean the minimum is going to be 50 million and we want to ramp up pretty quickly up to 250, 500. Some deals are really sexy. Sometimes it's exciting to close a deal. A lot of energy and testosterone comes together. So often though you want to feed your mind some other stuff to maintain and expand other dimensions. For instance I took up quantum physics. Am I spare time? It's for non-scientists though. It's not mathematical but it's very interesting because if you work on Wall Street things can tend to be a little one-sided and so you want to feed your brain something else for a change. It's interesting that we're all working with the same data. We all have the same earnings, forecasts, reports but the incredible thing about Alex is he reads the way the market interprets that data. He gets in sync with the market. At the age of 22 it came to the United States. First three years I spent as a cab driver. Then I got into the Wall Street, cut my licenses and I become a day trader. How I make money I do a lot of charts. I'd probably go through 700 or 800 charts. Did they go up? How did they finish? That's what happened to gold. It was a huge turnaround. So what I will do is buy a basket of a gold and steel and see what it's going to do. Victor what's up? We probably doing 500 to 1000 trades a day. We care what's going to be in the next 30 seconds, a minute, two minutes of a variety of different intervals. And there's maybe 10,000 people like we are. So figure out every time I buy the computer I compete against the person like me. If you made money today, somebody else lost. Yeah, I'm looking to get in. I'm a problem would make much more money than I'm making right now. But taking a much significant losses and be more volatile probably be up to 10,000 dollars, be down 10,000 dollars. But this is not my style. Every month you have to be up. You have to get the paycheck. All of this decent is about 2 million shares. It's going to be a nice comeback. This is a fast making a decision. This is like a police. You either take a shot or you're going to get shot. They trade us by here, sell their hedge funds by here, try to sell here. Big investor by here. Hopeful to sell there. But we're all here for the same. This is our job. Buy a little sell high. Aha. It seems somebody got this thing to work. There are things I really like about Wall Street and there are things I don't really like about Wall Street. The great thing about it really is a melting pot. There's a meritocracy to it and maybe that's the big word. But it's based off of Barrett usually. He changed his name to inherit money. Oh my god, the shame of it. What I don't like about Wall Street is there's too much of an urgency on this exact moment. Sipping in and out of stocks, pace it a little bit more. This is a marathon. It's not a bunch of wind sprints.
