**核心观点：**

作者通过为期90天、共60次的高压氧疗程个人测试，得出结论认为高压氧疗法是迄今为止他尝试过的最有效的长寿疗法，显著改善了多项关键生物标志物，并带来了全面的身体年轻化效果。

**总体框架：**

本文采用的是一种“个人科学实验”（n=1试验）框架，用于评估潜在的长寿疗法。该框架包括：定义详细的疗程方案（剂量、频率、时长）、建立健康基线测量（生物标志物）、执行干预措施（在家安装并完成高压氧疗程）、测量干预后的生物标志物变化、基于数据得出效果结论（与研究对比、量化改善）、讨论实践中的挑战与解决方案，以及对未来维持方案、可及性和证据驱动的医疗实践（Blueprint Quantified）的展望。

**结构化摘要：**

**引言：**
*   目的：测试世界顶尖长寿疗法，探讨人类是否能避免死亡。
*   引入：高压氧疗法（HBOT）是一种有前途但看似奇特的疗法，已被专业人士使用，且日益普及。

**HBOT方案与实施：**
*   决定：进行为期90天、共60次、每次90分钟的疗程。
*   测量：在疗程前后广泛测量生物标志物以评估效果。
*   实施：为保证依从性，在家中/诊所安装了HBOT舱。
*   技术细节：使用100%医用氧气，舱内压力达到2 ATA（相当于水下10米/33英尺）。高压使身体饱和纯氧，旨在促进愈合、改善线粒体功能、可能延缓衰老。

**潜在益处（基于研究/理论）：**
*   长寿目标：延长端粒、减少衰老细胞（参考研究：老年人群端粒延长38%，衰老细胞减少37%）。
*   身体表现：提高运动表现（VO2 Max、无氧阈值、握力、铁人三项成绩）。
*   组织健康：改善皮肤健康（胶原蛋白、弹性纤维、血管计数）、促进微生物组健康、全身年轻化。

**遇到的挑战与解决方案：**
*   初期困难：缺乏即时效果、总时长巨大（5400分钟）。
*   技术问题：初始氧气浓缩器未能达到100%氧气纯度 -> 解决方案：采购医用级100%氧气罐。
*   心理/环境挑战：幽闭恐惧症、呼吸阻力、枯燥、对紧急情况（地震）的担忧。
*   时间管理/枯燥问题 -> 解决方案：发现可在舱内安全使用电子设备，将疗程融入工作日常，成为期待的习惯。

**具体结果（生物标志物显著改善）：**
*   **总体结论：** HBOT是作者尝试过的最有效的长寿疗法。
*   **炎症（高敏CRP）：** 降至无法检测水平（为零）。
*   **VEGF（血管生长因子）：** 增加300%，表明血管生长。
*   **肠道健康（Akkermansia）：** 增加1000%（结合补充剂效果显著）。
*   **阿尔茨海默病标志物（P-TOW 127）：** 下降28.6%（尽管基线已较低）。
*   **皮肤健康：** 最显著的视觉改善，全身皮肤健康转化；UV皮肤损伤改善超过10%。
*   **端粒长度：** 增加2.6%（从11.4 KB到11.7 KB），增长约300个碱基对，相当于抵消了大约10年的生理年龄衰退（每年损失20-40个碱基对）。与老年研究的38%增长相比，作者因基线健康（相当于10岁水平）增长幅度相对较小但仍具意义。

**未来与建议：**
*   **维持方案：** 最佳维持剂量不确定，初步想法是每三个月20次。关键在于“度”和持续“激活”身体。
*   **疗程频率：** 必须在相对集中的时间内完成疗程，以积累效果。
*   **可及性：** 目前成本高昂（每次数百美元），希望未来普及后价格下降。
*   **重要提示：** 在尝试HBOT前务必咨询医生。
*   **Blueprint Quantified计划：** 正在建立认证体系，推广基于证据的医疗实践（包括HBOT），鼓励诊所进行基线-治疗-测量流程，以验证疗法效果。

 For the past few years, I have been testing the world's best longevity therapies to pose the question, are we the first generation who won't die? But there's one therapy I haven't tried, which, scuba divers, stroke patients, and elite athletes use, and it could be one of the most promising therapies I've ever done. It's called hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Now, this therapy may seem a bit exotic. It's actually more common than you think, like sauna or cryotherapy, it is available in many cities, which makes it all the more exciting if this works. So my protocol is to complete 60 sessions in 90 days. I will be doing sessions of 90 minutes. So this is what I've decided to do. I'm going to measure myself extensively as a baseline to figure out where I'm at right now with my biomarkers. And then at the end of the 90 days, I'm going to measure the same markers again and see did they improve, worsen, or stay the same? And that would give us evidence. Is this an important therapy or is this some other overblown longevity therapy that doesn't deliver results? First step was installing a chamber. I knew if it was at some local clinic where it took a 15 minute drive to get there, I would never be able to spend the 5,400 minutes doing that. It would be too much time. I had to build it into my life routine where I could also work. So I had it installed in my clinic where I could do it every single day. Let me show you how I do this. First, turn on the power converter. All right, next is to turn on the pressurization. Flip this guy. All right, system with power. Get the pressurization and the oxygen is now on. Now we're going to turn the system on. And the controls we have are internal. So I can jump in there and start the session and end the session. So almost these guys up is where the 100% oxygen comes from. Flip the mask. And then once this is done, I'll close the doors and start the pressurization. And it will go to 2 ATA, which is equivalent to 10 meters or 33 feet below water. The increased pressure in the tank allows your body to be saturated with pure oxygen. For oxygen, it means faster healing, better mitochondrial function, and possibly slower aging. I'm using H-Bot for a few objectives. One is for longevity. Two is for performance. And three is to potentially elongate my telomeres. What are telomeres? Telomeres are the protective caps at the ends of our chromosomes, like the tips of your shoelaces. As we age, they gradually shorten and fray. This shortening is linked to cellular aging in a wide range of age-related diseases. It's the ticking of your biological clock. A really important variable in longevity. Now what study we referenced for this therapy was in an older population, the H-Bot was efficacious in increasing the length of telomeres by up to 38% and reducing senescent cells by up to 37%. Senescent cells emit what's called these pro-inflammatory cytokines. They're basically bad things you don't want in your body. In the longevity world, these are massive numbers. In looking at the data around H-Bot, a few things we found really encouraging, it had increased athletic performance without changing training or diet. For example, there was a 10-15% improvement in both VO2 max and anaerobic threshold, a 7-10% increase in grip strength, and a 9.2% increase in an Olympic triathlon time. There's also a lot of promise in improving tissue, skin health, and microbiome. H-Bot has the promise of whole-body rejuvenation. 20 minutes pure oxygen, a 5-minute break, and then 20 minutes pure oxygen, 5-minute break. So you're going from high O2 to low O2. Inside this chamber, oxygen remains at 21%, the same as our atmosphere. I'm breathing 100% oxygen through the mask. By day 5, I was beginning to worry. I had 5,400 minutes to spend in that chamber. I was only 5 days in. I wasn't seeing the benefits. I wondered, can I really pull this off? But the studies show that the gains accumulate over time, not in the beginning. Once we got started, we ran into a major problem. We initially had an oxygen concentrator when it was only reaching about 92% oxygen. And we needed 100%. So while the chamber could get to two atmospheres, it was ready to go, we didn't yet have a 100% pure oxygen. So to solve that problem, we sourced 100% oxygen, medical grade canisters that we then connected to the chamber. When you first start doing H-Bot, it definitely is a unique experience. One, you're in a highly pressurized chamber, and it makes you wonder what if something goes wrong. I live in California, there's a lot of earthquakes. And I wondered if there's an earthquake, if I had to do something fast, how fast can I move? And so the fastest depressurization time from two atmospheres is around two minutes. A lot of my friends couldn't even get inside the chamber. They're too claustrophobic. Also, when you put on the mask, sometimes it can feel a little restricting. Where you breathe in, there's some resistance when you are doing the therapy. So there's a problem there. H-Bot really tries you from claustrophobia, breathing, duration of time, and also if you don't have anything to do, you're kind of left with your thoughts. I have to confess, by day 30, I was again questioning am I really going to pull this off. My days are incredibly busy. I'm running four different companies. I have various therapies throughout the day, and I'm producing content to share the results of the world. And I wondered, can I really see this thing through? I wasn't sure. This is what changed this for me. When I realized I could safely have electronics inside the chamber, I could then begin working. Inside the chamber is 21% oxygen, which is the same as the atmosphere. That's why I can safely bring electronics inside here. And then it became part of a day, the ritual that I actually look forward to every day where I could work and focus on my most important things and we're doing the therapy at the same time. In looking at the evidence, I was really curious on how H-Bot might improve my skin. One study showed a 12.8% increase in collagen fiber density, a 144% increase in elastic fiber length plus a reduction in fragmentation from 90% to 10%. And finally, a 40.9% increase in blood vessel count. What this therapy amounted to is the world's best whole body skin rejuvenation therapy. This is extremely hard to do with other methods. I know we've looked at the evidence. It was also important because we have tried to fix the sun damage I incurred as a child and we've had very little success. This entire thing could all have been for nothing and I had invested a lot of time. I had spent 90 days. I had shifted my entire life to accommodate this therapy. I sat in this little teeny tiny cube, 5,400 minutes and it was worth it. After completing 60 H-Bot sessions, my biomarkers improved across my entire body. I think it's reasonable to say that H-Bot is the most efficacious longevity therapy I've done since starting this endeavor. I'm going to read to you from this long list of biomarkers, the things that improve because I think it's actually worth going through each item. Normally, I would just try to summarize in some succinct fashion, but actually I think this extended list is really worth your learning. So first, let me start with inflammation. This is a marker called high sensitivity CRP. You're looking at systematic inflammation across the entire body and I had no detectable levels of systematic inflammation in my body. That is a wild result. Inflammation is oftentimes the biggest culprit of problematic disease and dysfunction inside the body is called inflammation and I had nothing in my body. So H-Bot took inflammation in my body to zero. To veg F, this is a signal that boosts the growth of blood vessels. So I had a 300% increase in veg F, which is signaling the increase of this blood vessel growth. You may not realize that you have over 60,000 miles of blood vessels in your body. I'm curious how many miles of blood vessels did I lay down track for? I don't have that number, but really interesting to learn. As to my gut health, my acromancia, before H-Bot, it was not detectable. Afterwards, it was a 1000% increase. Now acromancia is linked to gut barrier integrity and metabolic health. I have been taking an acromancia supplement for two months and it was still undetectable even before H-Bot. Then after H-Bot, it increased by 1000%. The combination of the supplement plus H-Bot dramatically improved the absorption of my body. And next, we looked at the dimension marker P-TOW 127. So this is a specific marker for Alzheimer's disease. And that declined by 28.6%. I was already below the reference range of someone indicating this was a risk for chronic disease, but still to see it go down that much was pretty dramatic. Now in regards to skin health, I would say that was probably the most dramatic visual marker. I had read about the increased collagen production in the Alastin, the reduced fragmentation from 90 to 10%, but then to see those variables take place in my own skin across my entire body, it just transformed the health of my skin across my body. We also used multi-scutural imaging to measure my UV skin damage, which improved by over 10% in the H-Bot protocol. Now as it relates to telomeres, I'd like to explain a few details because I think it's worth you knowing. I had a baseline measurement in March of 2024 and my measurement was 11.4 KB. After H-Bot, they measured at 11.7 KB. That's a 2.6% increase. Now in the studies, we looked at people in its older population, 65 and older, experienced up to 38% increase in telomerate elongation. So it's not surprising that that age group would have a significant improvement, whereas I'm very healthy to begin with. Now to give you context on 11.4 and 11.7, that is the age equivalent of a 10 year old. So my telomeres, which are a significant representation of biological age and health, I'm already at a 10 year old level. In the gain I had, which was basically 300 base pairs from 11.4 to 11.7, you have to consider is each of us lose between 20 and 40 base pairs each year, so I gained 300, which is roughly equivalent to a decade of aging. I explained this detail to you because telomerate really are something that's very exciting in the longevity community. Therapies that can actually elongate them are very promising. And so I want to give you context of where the study showed was possible and then what I experienced myself. Now that I've completed 60 sessions in 90 days, the question becomes, do I do more? Now I've spoken to several experts and the truest answer is, nobody really knows. Currently, the thought is 20 sessions every three months might be appropriate. What you're trying to do is to say, hey, body, keep on producing the stem cells, keep on producing the veg F, keep on producing blood cells. You're trying to prime the body just enough, but not too much. Now I've learned this with Blueprint is there's definitely a, the dose is the poison, the dose is the longevity benefit. So as we experiment with the continuation of the protocol, trying to figure out the right maintenance dose, as always, we will share the results with you. At this point, you may be pretty excited about HVOT and if you are, I understand I would be too. And what you want to do is you want to follow a certain protocol. People oftentimes make the mistake where their sessions are spread out too far apart. They need to be within some kind of constrained timeframe for the benefits to accumulate. But now it can be expensive. I think clinics charge maybe in the range of a few hundred dollars per session. So I hope that as HVOT increases the popularity, more centers open, systems become cheaper and more people have greater accessibility. Now, as always, before you do HVOT, make sure you consult with your doctor as what you may do, maybe unique to your certain conditions. Now, one thing I know everybody's going to experience is you're going to try to find an HVOT provider that qualifies and meets your needs and sometimes you can't find out the expertise you need. So we are working on this in building an endeavor called Blueprint Quantified. We are on to certify clinics for taking an evidence-based approach and what they do. So we'll say if you're going to offer HVOT, you can be certified one, two, or three, and if this may change in time. But if you're going to follow a protocol where you take a baseline measurement of markers, you do a given therapy, and then you measure again so that when you go to the clinic, you have a verifiable outcome. Did it work? Did it not work for the thing you're trying to address? This is going to improve healthcare. It's going to improve outcomes. It will make you and everyone else a better person in life.
