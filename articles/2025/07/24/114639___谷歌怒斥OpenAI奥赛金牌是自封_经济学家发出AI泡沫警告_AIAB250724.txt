**二、 AI 市场与经济风险**
    *   **经济学家预警AI泡沫**
        *   **主要观点：** 阿波罗全球管理公司首席经济学家托尔斯滕·斯洛克指出，当前AI热潮比上世纪90年代的互联网泡沫更为夸张。
        *   **市场估值过高：** 英伟达、微软等科技巨头估值远超2000年互联网崩溃前夕的水平。
        *   **泡沫迹象：** 未来12个月预期市盈率已超过互联网泡沫峰值，且头部十家公司与其余公司的市盈率差距巨大，显示投资脱离现实。
        *   **巨头投资狂热：**  despite预警，OpenAI、Meta、微软、亚马逊等科技巨头仍在疯狂增加AI投资，推动AI军备竞赛持续升级。

**三、 AI 竞赛的白热化**
    *   **AI军备竞赛蔓延至国际奥数**
        *   **OpenAI宣布奥数金牌：** OpenAI声称其AI模型获得国际数学奥林匹克金牌，该水平仅9%顶尖人类选手能达到。
        *   **Google DeepMind的质疑：** 指责OpenAI公然抢发，违反IMO官方要求所有AI公司7月28日后才能公布结果的规定。
        *   **结果认证争议：** Google的成绩获IMO官方认证，而OpenAI的仅由三位前IMO奖牌得主审核，被指为“自吹自擂”。
        *   **各方立场：**
            *   Google DeepMind研究员质疑OpenAI结果的“真实性”。
            *   OpenAI研究员辩称不知情且在闭幕式后发布。
            *   IMO协调员斥责OpenAI行为“无礼且不当”。
        *   **竞赛本质：** 这场“神仙打架”不仅是为了金牌，更是为了争夺AI领域的话语权和顶尖人才。

**四、 未来人机交互的探索**
    *   **NeuralOS：AI生成操作系统**
        *   **核心痛点：** 当前人机交互方式（固定图标与菜单）被视为过时，如同1980年代的终端。
        *   **核心理念：** 加拿大滑铁卢大学与国家研究委员会提出的NeuralOS，将整个操作系统界面视为“生成任务”，AI实时预测并“绘制”屏幕下一帧。
        *   **技术架构：**
            *   **“决策大脑”：** 模仿传统操作系统“内核”，负责记忆和追踪系统状态，接收输入并决定下一步操作。
            *   **“神笔马良”：** 采用扩散模型，模仿“渲染器”，接收“大脑”指令，逐帧绘制逼真屏幕。
        *   **关键创新与效果：**
            *   **光标定位图：** 直接提供AI光标位置信息，大幅提升交互精度，光标定位平均误差小于1.5像素。
            *   **准确率提升：** 模拟复杂状态转换（如打开/关闭应用）时，准确率达37.7%，远超随机猜测（1.4%），表明其理解GUI逻辑。
            *   **模拟现实不确定性：** 错误方式（如预测窗口仍开而实际已关）体现其学习了模拟现实不确定性的概率模型，更接近真实。
        *   **未来潜力与局限：** 仍处于概念验证阶段，分辨率低、速度慢（1.8帧/秒），尚不能处理精细操作，但其核心思想潜力巨大，有望颠覆未来人机交互方式。

Your all-around AI assistant is now officially launched. ChatGPT can not only talk, but also help you book flights, fill out forms, and even generate PPT with one click. However, behind the AI craze, top economists have issued the strongest warning in history: it is even more exaggerated than the Internet bubble of the year! At the same time, this AI arms race has spread from the capital market to the International Mathematical Olympiad! OpenAI and Google are openly fighting for a "gold medal". Who is rushing to start and who is not playing fair? Finally, we will interpret a paper called NeuralOS for you. It will subvert the way we interact with computers-what will the world be like if the future operating system is AI "drawn" for you in real time? All the major AI events you want to know are in this issue of "AIAB Face"! OpenAI officially launches ChatGPT Agent mode. This AI assistant can not only talk, but also do things. You only need to give instructions and it can operate in its own virtual computer. It can help you book flights and hotels, fill out online forms, crawl website data, and even generate PPT and analyze Excel spreadsheets. It can directly connect your Gmail and GitHub through connectors to help you plan dinner parties, analyze meeting schedules, or build financial models. However, it is more like a master of imitation than a real problem solver. For example, in a complex test simulating a cyber attack, it was completely at a loss and could not connect multiple steps in series to complete the task. Security issues are of course the top priority. After all, an AI that can help you place an order is likely to be used by bad guys. For this reason, OpenAI has added multiple insurances to it, such as obtaining your consent before executing key operations such as purchases. Currently, Pro, Plus and Team users can already try it out. Pro users can call it 400 times a month, while Plus and Team users can only call it 40 times. Your digital assistant has finally evolved from talking big to rolling up your sleeves to work. Are you ready to let it help you? Is the craze for AI giving rise to the biggest bubble in history? Top economists have issued a warning! Torsten Slok, chief economist of Apollo Global Management, jumped out to say that the hype about AI is even more exaggerated than the Internet bubble in the 1990s. The market's valuations of technology giants such as Nvidia and Microsoft are even more outrageous than on the eve of the Internet crash in 2000. History seems to be repeating itself, except that the keyword that year has changed from "Internet" to "AI. " Back then, countless companies relied on the Internet concept to attract venture capital. Their valuations soared before they actually made a profit. As a result, the expectations were dashed and the bubble burst, resulting in numerous casualties in startups. Slok believes that today's situation is even more unrealistic. Using the expected P/E ratio for the next 12 months as a magic mirror, the current value has exceeded the peak of the Internet bubble. But what's more frightening is that the P/E ratio gap between the top ten companies and other companies in the index is ridiculous. This shows that investment in these AI giants has become out of touch with reality. But even if the alarm bells are ringing louder, technology giants are still frantically increasing their investments. OpenAI wants to create an AI browser to challenge Google. Meta has spent more than $60 billion to build an AI data center. Microsoft has laid off 9, 000 people for the $80 billion AI infrastructure cost. Amazon has also announced its own intelligent AI plan. This AI arms race shows no signs of slowing down. Is this gamble opening a new era or blowing up the bubble of the next century? The battle for the throne of the AI world has already spread to the International Mathematical Olympiad! OpenAI suddenly announced that its experimental AI model won the gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad. This is a level that only less than 9% of the top human players can achieve each year. However, Google DeepMind immediately became restless and said that OpenAI's move was a blatant preemption! It turned out that the IMO official required all AI companies to wait until July 28 to announce the results. OpenAI directly ignored the ban. What 's more outrageous is that Google's results are "real gold" certified and stamped by the IMO official, while OpenAI's? They found three former IMO medal winners to review them, which is self-promotion. Now Google directly tore up the DeepMind researchers and said that without going through the official process, who knows if you are one point away from a silver medal. The OpenAI researchers defended that we did not communicate with the IMO official and did not know about this. Moreover, the results were released after the closing ceremony. The IMO coordinator immediately slapped them in the face and said that OpenAI not only preempted but also "rude and inappropriate. " OpenAI admits that this model is extremely expensive and will not be available to the public for the time being, but the technology will be passed on. This battle between the gods is not only for the gold medal, but also for the right to speak and top talents in the field of AI. Who do you think is the real winner of this AI Olympics? Do you think that the way we interact with computers has not changed much in decades? Andrej Karpathy, a leading figure in the AI community, once lamented: "Chatting with LLM feels like using a terminal from the 1980s. " Our AI can already write poetry, paint, and compose music, but we are still trapped in fixed icons and menus. But what if AI can not only understand your instructions but also "draw" a complete, real-time interactive operating system for you? Today we will talk about a paper from the University of Waterloo and the National Research Council of Canada: NeuralOS. Its core idea is to regard the entire operating system interface as a "generation task. " You move the mouse and it predicts and generates what the next frame of the screen should look like. In order to achieve this, the researchers designed a very clever "dual-core" architecture that imitates the division of labor between the "kernel" and the "renderer" in traditional operating systems. The first part is the "decision-making brain. " It is responsible for memorizing and tracking the "state" of the system, such as which folder window you opened and where it is now. It receives your mouse and keyboard input and then decides "what should happen next". The second part is "Magic Brush Ma Liang". The paper uses a diffusion model that receives instructions from the "brain" and then "draws" the realistic screen we see frame by frame. But there is a technical difficulty here: how can AI accurately draw that small mouse cursor? The NeuralOS team came up with a brilliant way. They don't let the model guess but directly give it a "cursor position map" to clearly tell it "the cursor is here". This seemingly simple operation greatly improves the accuracy of the interaction and is also one of the key innovations of this paper. So, what is the effect? First of all, the average error of cursor positioning is less than 1. 5 pixels, which is almost indistinguishable to the naked eye. Secondly, when simulating complex state transitions such as opening applications and closing windows, its accuracy rate reached 37. 7%, far exceeding the 1. 4% of random guessing. This proves that NeuralOS does understand the logic of GUI operation, but what is more interesting is the way it "makes mistakes". For example, sometimes the window is closed in the real world, but it is still open in NeuralOS's prediction. This is not necessarily an error, but because the operating system has a delay in responding. This just shows that NeuralOS has learned a probabilistic model that simulates the uncertainty in the real world, which makes it closer to "reality" than a rigid program. Of course, NeuralOS is still just a "proof of concept". Its resolution is not high, the speed is only 1. 8 frames per second, and it can't handle delicate work such as precise typing in the terminal, but the idea itself still has some potential.
