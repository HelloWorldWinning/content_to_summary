Description:
好的，这是根据您提供的文本进行的摘要和分析，全部采用简体中文呈现。

**摘要大纲**

1.  **发现**
    *   在隧道中找到一个带有奇异符号的巨大圆环（直径约25英尺）。
    *   圆环周围有一个更大的球体。
    *   被发现者称之为“传送门”或“星际之门”（现代称谓）。

2.  **第一次探险 (1928)**
    *   上校与一名助手穿过圆环。
    *   进入一个“新世界”或“另一维度”：开放区域、牧场、河流（认为是尼罗河）。
    *   观察到金字塔建造过程的“影像”（如电影）。
    *   观察到奇异的飞行物搬运巨石。
    *   观察到地下区域有大量人员进行各种工作（烘焙、木工、绘画）。
    *   观察到“履带”上有人体被送入隧道。
    *   经历时间膨胀：内部待了约1小时，外部已过去3天（72小时）。
    *   外部团队的反应：害怕，撤出隧道，认为他们已消失或被吞没，等待3天。
    *   上校和助手返回，上校在日记中记录见闻。
    *   上校声称了解金字塔建造方法、位置及下方隧道。
    *   在日记中描述见到“奇异的生物”，认为“可能不是来自地球”。

3.  **第二次探险**
    *   回到营地后，需要补充物资，离开。
    *   回到原地区，建立新营地，带来更多人，包括当地人。
    *   尝试通过翻译向当地人解释发现，但当地人似乎了解并恐惧该隧道/传说，拒绝进入。
    *   上校与另一名不同助手再次进入。
    *   此次准备充分，携带补给。
    *   继续观察：更近距离看到金字塔建造、奇异飞行物搬运巨石、地下活动（包括履带上的人体）。
    *   内部停留约一周。
    *   返回时，外部时间也过去约一周（与第一次的时间膨胀不同）。
    *   上校将所有经历详细记录在日记中。

4.  **返回与不信**
    *   上校最终回到英国。
    *   向一个学会讲述他的故事。
    *   学会成员无人相信他，认为“不可能”、“不可行”，尽管有证人（两次探险共有两名不同证人）。
    *   上校坚持并保留了他的日记。

5.  **后续**
    *   时间跳转至1940年。

**核心结论**

一位英国上校在1928年发现了一个疑似传送门的装置，通过它进入了一个揭示金字塔建造秘密、存在未知科技和非地球生物的异度空间/时间，但他将这些非凡经历载入日记并公之于众后，却遭到了其所属社会群体的全面否定和不信。

**总体框架**

这是一个关于非凡发现、超维度/时间探索、遭遇未知文明/生物、以及个人经历与机构性怀疑之间冲突的叙事框架，以日记记录作为核心证据。

Content:
 He found this ring, a big ring, and didn't know what it was, but saw this strange writing on, these strange symbols on this ring. So then he and another person walked through it to look at the other side, and lo and behold, they got into some other severe, as if they walked into another dimension. And this ring, so the audience knows, we're talking like what diameter? It's probably 25 feet in diameter. And the sphere was even larger than that. Oh, as they walked into it, it was like a new world. As he explained in his diary, it was like a new world. And he couldn't figure out how he got from one place and the closed sarcophagus almost into this open area. Is this a portal of some sort? Well, today we would call it a portal or a Stargate. I think we would refer to it today as a Stargate. But back in those days in 1928, it wasn't, they didn't know what it was, but when he walked into it, it was as if he was in a new world. It was an open area, plush pastures. He sees a river, which he assumed to be the Nile, and he sees almost a movie occurring showing people building these pyramids. And he's in there, he thinks, for maybe an hour, but when he comes out, he's been there for three days. He's been for over 72 hours, because the crew that he came with were scared. They got out of that tunnel and got out into the open because they thought that they ended up on some other side. Or swallowed them up. Or swallowed them up. And so, but three days later, they come back out. How many of the team went with him? Only two. Only two. But there was six other team members, they eat total. And so those other six left, but they stayed up in the area outside where they had an encampment. And eventually three days later, the colonel in his assistant comes back out, and he talks of this new world that they found, and that he knows now how these pyramids were built. He knows where they are located. He knows that there's tunnels under each one of them. And he sees these strange looking beings. And this is in his diary. Strange looking beings that are probably not from Earth. Now he says this in his diary. This is 1928. So then decide to make another camp. They had to go get supplies to come back, because they were only had enough supplies for a few days or a week or something like that. But they did, and they brought more people back. This time they brought back from some local people. And they tried to explain through an interpreter to these local people what they had found. And these local people didn't want any part of going down there. They seemed to be aware of maybe the rumors or the legends about this particular tunnel. The Colonel didn't, he wasn't afraid to go back. So he went back with another person, a different person, not the same that he went the first time. So they go down there, this time they're prepared. They have supplies, they have water, they have things. Because although they saw water going through there, they didn't know if they should drink it or not. Anyways, they walked through. This time he's closer to where they're building a pyramid. He sees these strange things in the sky that are flying around with these large bricks. He's stumped. He can't understand what these things are that are flying. Although during that time period, there were airplanes, conventional airplanes. A single-engine airplane. Yeah, single-engine airplanes. And in the 1920s, we had them during World War I. But they didn't look like any of those type of aircrafts. And remember, he's a British colonel, and he'd been through war, and he knew airplanes. He'd been through World War I. But he couldn't understand, it couldn't rationalize what these other things were. And they're holding these giant blocks. Right. And it's like a movie. He sees these things happening. And he watches this pyramid being built. But he also sees this underground area where there's tunnels and there are vast amount of people working in certain tasks down there. Some people are baking, some people are doing some kind of work, like painting or a carpentry work. And then some are lying down on what he refers to as a conveyor belt. And these bodies are like moving into this tunnel. So he's down there for about a week. He's estimating. When he comes out, now he has a story to tell. He documents all this in his diary. If he was a week down there when he got back, was he gone for four weeks? No, he came back and it was a week missing time for a week. And then he goes back. He eventually gets back to the UK. And he tells his story to a society. And none of them believe him. They didn't believe him. They didn't believe a word he said. Even though he had a witness to witnesses, because he brought two different people in there. So they said, no, we don't believe you. It isn't impossible. What you say is not feasible. But he keeps this. Now, jump ahead to 1940.
