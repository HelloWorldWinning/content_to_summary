Description:
好的，以下是根据您提供的文本提炼、总结和分析的内容，全部使用简体中文呈现：

**核心观点：**

印度未能解决当前问题的根本原因在于否认现实，并将责任错误地归咎于已结束近80年的殖民历史，而非正视并解决自身的腐败、无能和不良习惯等内部问题。

**总体框架：**

文章采取批判性视角，首先描述印度惯常将当前问题归咎于英国殖民主义的现象，并将其称为“借口机器”。接着，通过独立时间跨度、对比其他国家的发展、以及承认英国统治的某些建设性贡献来反驳这一说法。随后，文章详细列举了印度在公共卫生、社会习惯、政治领导、教育、种姓制度、民主实践和环境等方面的具体问题，明确指出这些是印度自身原因造成的，与殖民历史无关。最终，文章得出结论，认为印度的主要障碍是自我否认和缺乏责任感，并呼吁印度正视自身问题，停止归咎于历史，才能实现真正的进步。

**结构化总结：**

*   **印度将当前问题归咎于殖民历史（引言与问题提出）**
    *   印度倾向于将贫困、腐败、卫生差、基础设施破败等深层问题全部归咎于英国殖民统治。
    *   这成为印度领导人和知识分子常用的“借口”或“口号”。
*   **反驳：独立时间已久，需承担责任**
    *   英国已于1947年离开，至今已近80年。
    *   国家不能永远扮演受害者，必须开始承担责任。
*   **对比其他国家：克服历史，实现发展**
    *   中国：虽曾被西方列强欺凌和日本占领，但现已是全球超级大国，基础设施先进。
    *   韩国：经历战争和占领破坏，已转型为科技和工业强国。
    *   印度：相形之下，仍停留在“哭诉历史”，而非解决实际问题。
*   **英国统治的复杂性：统一与建设（辩证看待历史）**
    *   承认英国存在掠夺，但也指出英国统一了印度（从500多个土邦）、建立了铁路系统和法律框架，并带来了“印度”作为一个单一国家的概念。
    *   认为没有英国，可能就没有统一的印度，而是众多纷争的小国。
*   **当前问题：源于印度自身的内部原因**
    *   **卫生状况与习惯：** 差劲的公共卫生（随地吐痰、露天排便、河流污染）是当前问题， स्वच्छ भारत 运动失败是内部执行问题，与殖民遗产无关。
    *   **行为习惯输出：** 乱扔垃圾、随地大小便、种姓歧视等不良习惯甚至被部分海外印度社区带到其他国家。
    *   **政治领导层：** 领导人利用殖民创伤转移对其自身腐败、无能和治理失败的注意力。
    *   **教育体系：** 体系缺陷（唯考试、缺乏创新、裙带关系、种姓保留）是印度官僚体制造成，而非英国教学大纲的错。
    *   **种姓制度：** 这是印度古老的问题（早于殖民数世纪），是印度的“原罪”，其持续存在及相关压迫与暴力是印度自身问题，归咎于英国是逃避责任。
    *   **民主的虚伪性：** 声称民主却压制异议、优先象征性项目而非基本需求、存在矛盾现象（如禁食牛肉与营养不良并存），这些是印度领导人造成，非殖民主义影响。
    *   **中产阶级虚伪性：** 一边批评殖民主义，一边依赖英国体系（护照、教育、法律）并渴望移民英国。
    *   **环境问题：** 严重的空气和水污染是当前印度自身行为所致。
*   **结论：否认是印度的主要敌人**
    *   印度最大的敌人不是殖民主义，而是对自身问题的否认。
    *   只有承认自身问题，才能前进，否则将继续停滞、肮脏、分裂且自欺欺人。
    *   印度需要出口清洁、责任感和诚实的文化，而非仅仅是文化产品。

 Every time you question parats deep-rooted problems, be it poverty, corruption, casteeism, lack of sanitation or the crumbling infrastructure, you're met with the same recycled excuse. We were colonised. It's like the favourite slogan of Indian leaders and intellectuals who love blaming the British for every broken toilet, every open sewer, every child begging on the street and every collapsed flyover. But here's the bitter truth no one in Parat wants to swallow. The British left in 1947. It's been nearly 80 years. At some point the nation must stop playing the eternal victim and start taking responsibility. How long are you going to mourn colonialism while sitting in a broken-down train station filled with garbage and spit-stained walls? Let's face the facts. Bharat loves to act like it's the only country that suffered under foreign rule. It wasn't. China was humiliated by the British during the opium wars, occupied by the Japanese and carved up by multiple imperial powers. Yet today it's a global superpower with cutting-edge infrastructure, top universities and cities that make Indian metros look like slums in comparison. South Korea, another example, was devastated by war and occupation, yet it transformed into a tech and industrial powerhouse. But Bharat, it's still crying over a history book instead of fixing potholes and public toilets. And the irony is unbearable. Bharat blames the British for its current problems but conveniently forgets that without the British there wouldn't even be a unified Bharat. Before colonization, the region was a patchwork of over 500 princely states, each with its own king, currency and laws. The British didn't just loot, they also laid down the railway system, the legal framework and yes, the idea of Bharat itself. Without them there would be no New Delhi or central government. There'd be 500 microstates still fighting over rivers, language and cows. But Indians were burned British flags on the streets while driving on roads built by them. What's worse is that Bharat still clings to the same medieval mindset it had before colonization. Hygiene is a national catastrophe. Streets smell like urine, trash piles tower in markets and rivers like the Ganges are worshipped one minute and dumped with toxic waste the next. The Swatch Bharat campaign was supposed to be a national revolution in cleanliness, instead it became a PR stunt with more posters than public toilets. But again ask why it failed and the answer will be colonial mentality. Apparently the British are responsible for Bharati spitting good-ka on every surface and defecating in the open even today. Even the global Indian diaspora reflects this attitude. You can take the Indian out of India but you can't take the filth out of the Indian. Go to areas in Canada, the United Kingdom or the United States where large Bharati communities reside and you'll see the pattern. Streets become dirtier, public behaviour drops and suddenly the same issues that plague parrots start cropping up abroad. Littering, public urination, caste-based discrimination, it's all exported like it's part of the culture. Instead of adapting to cleaner, better environments, many Indians, well they recreate their messy ecosystems in other nations, proudly bringing with them the same habits that turned their own cities into dumping grounds. Leadership in Bharat is no better. Every election cycle politicians harp on about colonial trauma to distract from their failures. Bharati talks about Amrit Karl while farmers harm their livelihood, cities flood and children die in hospitals due to oxygen shortages. But don't worry, blame the British for not leaving behind enough ventilators. The truth is, Bharat's ruling class has perfected the art of weaponising history to stay in power. They invoke colonialism not out of pain but convenience. It's easier to say we were colonised than to admit we are corrupt, lazy and incompetent. Take the education system. British designed, maybe, but it's Indian bureaucrats who made it a soul-crushing exam obsessed nightmare. Students memorise for marks not to learn. Innovation is punished. Teachers are underpaid, schools are under equipped and caste still determines who gets ahead. Yet, when the results are dismal, it's the fault of the British syllabus. Not the nepotism, not the bribery, not the caste-based reservations that honestly strangle merit. And let's not ignore the caste system, one of the most vile and backward features of Indian society. It predates colonialism by centuries, yet somehow the British are blamed for cementing it, as if they invented it. As if centuries of brahminical oppression, dullet killings and manual scavenging are all part of some imperial conspiracy. No. The caste system is India's original sin, and pretending otherwise is a coward's escape from accountability. Meanwhile, Bharat parades itself on the global stage as the world's largest democracy. But what kind of democracy silences journalists, jails activists and censors films and books for hurting sentiments? What kind of democracy celebrates building the world's tallest statue, while millions live without clean drinking water? What kind of democracy bans beef, but let's children die of malnutrition? Colonialism didn't create this hypocrisy. Indian leaders did. The Indian middle class, educated in English and obsessed with Western validation, loves to bash colonialism while consuming everything British, from the parliamentary system to cricket. They'll praise Hindu culture for its ancient wisdom, but use British passports, British education and British legal protection when they leave the country. The hypocrisy is staggering. They romanticize Vedas and Ayurveda while rushing to get UK visas. If colonialism was so damaging, why are Indians so desperate to migrate to their former colonizers? And while we're at it, let's talk about the environment. Bharat cries about climate change injustice from the West, but I mean, just look at what it's doing to its own air and water. Delhi's air is toxic enough to kill a child. Rivers are chemical soups. Forests are cleared for temples and highways. The British are gone. Who's dumping untreated sewage into lakes now? The ghosts of East India Company? It's time someone said it out loud. India's biggest enemy isn't colonialism. It's denial. A country cannot heal what it refuses to admit. As long as Bharat keeps using colonialism as a moral crutch, it will keep limping forward while others run. China doesn't talk about the opium wars every day. Japan doesn't whine about Hiroshima while making bullet trains, but India, it can't flush a toilet without blaming Queen Victoria. Instead of exporting yoga and Bollywood, maybe Bharat should start exporting a culture of cleanliness, responsibility and honesty. But for that, Indians need to admit they are the problem, not the British, not the muggles, not some ancient invader, just them, their leaders, their choices, their habits. colonialism ended in 1947, but Bharat's excuse machine hasn't. And until it does, the country will remain stuck, dirty, divided and honestly delusional while pretending it's a superpower in the making.
