Description:
Okay, here's a structured summary of the core ideas:

**I. Bollinger Bands Basics and Advantages:**
    *   Bollinger Bands are path-type indicators that show trends (up, down, or sideways) with clear support and resistance levels, unlike moving averages with multiple levels.
    *  The middle band indicates the trend direction: rising middle band means uptrend, falling means downtrend, flat means consolidation.
    *   The bands also show trend strength: price hugging the upper band indicates a strong uptrend, while hugging the lower band indicates a strong downtrend.

**II. 12 Bollinger Band Buy and Sell Points:**
    *   **Buying Points:**
        1.  Oversold Rebound (price falling below lower band, then rebounding near it)
        2.  Lower Band Touch (buying after retesting the lower band for confirmation)
        3. Middle Band Breakthrough (price breaking above the middle band)
        4. Middle Band Retest (price pulling back and then finding support at the middle band)
        5. Upper Band Touch (price consistently holding at or near the upper band, indicating a strong trend)
         6. Upper Band Retrace( In a large cycle there is enough profit and loss ratio before buying)

    *   **Selling Points:**
        1.  Rejection at Upper Band (price moving away from the upper band after a rise, especially in a larger timeframe)
        2.  Lower Band Break (price falling below the lower band)
        3.  Upper Band Touch (price bouncing off and failing to hold above the upper band)
        4. Middle Band Break (price breaking below the middle band signaling trend change)
        5. Middle Band Retest (price rallies but is rejected at the middle band, confirming weakness)
        6. Lower Band Open(Price continuously falling towards lower band indicating strong downtrend)

**III. Profit & Loss Ratio with Bollinger Bands:**
    *  Calculate profit based on potential moves: Oversold to Lower Band, Lower to Middle Band, Middle to Upper Band, and above the upper band during strong trends.
    * Determine stop-loss levels based on where you buy relative to the bands.

**IV. Multi-Timeframe Analysis:**
    *   Use larger timeframes (monthly/weekly) to understand the broader trend.
    *  Then use smaller timeframes (daily) for trade entry/exit points based on the larger trend direction.
    *   Buy at supports of large cycles, and sell at resistances of large cycles, with higher winning rate.

**V. Combining Bollinger Bands with Other Systems:**
    *   Integrate other indicators like KDJ for overbought/oversold confirmation of divergence to improve signal accuracy.
    *    Using Volume for the confirmation of breakthroughs during trend movements.

**Concluding Fundamental Point:**
  By understanding and applying the Bollinger Bands correctly, traders can greatly improve their winning rate through precise entries and exits when combining multiple cycles, and systems.

Hello everyone, I am a trading marshal and a 10-year veteran trader. Today, the marshal will share with you the 12 buying and selling points of the Bollinger Bands to help you understand how to judge the trend of the Bollinger Bands, grasp the market strength, and sort out the wrong answers. For the Bollinger Bands,  I believe that many friends have understood it. It is actually very simple. However, it is very difficult to use Bollinger Bands well. Many of Dashuai’s friends often learn Bollinger Bands from Dashuai, but they have never been able to use it superbly. Grasp the buying and selling points of each wave. So today, the commander will combine all these examples, including why we should choose Bollinger Band, what are the advantages and disadvantages of Bollinger Band, and the specific 12 buying and selling of Bollinger Band.  Points and then the profit and loss ratio of Bollinger Bands to help everyone improve the winning rate. Finally, the multi-period judgment of Bollinger Bands can further improve the winning rate. Then using Bollinger Bands alone is not enough. We can then use Bollinger Bands in combination with other trading systems to greatly improve the winning rate.  By improving your winning rate, you can trade without having to worry about it. If you can use an indicator well, the commander feels that it is enough. Including the commander himself using the Bollinger Bands to complete a transaction with a high winning rate continuously.  The principal is getting bigger and bigger. Friends who like Dashuai also remember to subscribe to Dashuai’s channel. If you have any questions, you can leave a message in the comment area below. Dashuai will answer everyone’s questions after seeing it. First of all, why should you choose? Everyone needs to know the advantages of Bollinger Bands compared to others. That is that Bollinger Bands is a path-type indicator. What are the advantages of path-type indicators? It can show the upward or downward trend, which is the path. In addition, it  It shows the only support level and pressure level. Maybe many friends are used to using the moving average, which has a lot of support and pressure, right? The 5-day line has been supported by the 10-day line. The 10-day line has been supported. The 20-day line has been supported by the 20-day line.  There is a 30-day line and a 30- day line has broken through. There is a 60-day line. So which support is really effective? In the process of using the non-zero line, it has only the only support and pressure line. At the same time, the non-zero line can also show the trend.  The strength is so great. I will give you a specific case directly to help you judge. First of all, the first point of the non-zero line showing the trend is actually very simple. We only need to look at one, which is the middle track of the non-zero line. You can take a look at when Bollinger  When the middle rail of the Bollinger Band goes down, its trend is downward. When the middle rail of the Bollinger Band goes up, its trend is upward. When the middle rail of the Bollinger Band is in the oscillating time period, its trend is a shock.  The stage is to go flat, so we will find that the trend of any wave of market will go through several points. First, it falls, it falls, it stabilizes, it continues to rise, and then it stops rising, it continues to stabilize, it stabilizes.  After that, it will turn into a decline. After the decline, it will increase steadily. After it has stabilized, it will then increase. This is actually a process in which the main force develops chips, collects funds, and ships. It involves a lot of money gaming in it. Let's actually take a look at the current market. You will also find that at the end of any market, it rarely happens like this. It falls sharply and then rises sharply. Why is it because a large amount of funds have to distribute chips here or absorb chips here? To give a simple example, the fall here is very big.  Why did Shaoai go up immediately? Because many big funds here are going to make a long-short switch. Originally, they were eating all the airdrops. Now the intensity has become stronger. They want to switch to long. Or in other words, they have already eaten a lot in this.  The positions are successively flattened by one of the airdrop chips, so it will create such a shock range. This is particularly important, including when the rise is very sharp. He also needs a shock range to digest the funds and send out the chips little by little. Little by little, close out your long orders, or even open short orders after closing them, and then enter the next wave of falling market. So in fact, this is how the market goes, and here we only use one of the Bollinger Bands. In addition, the Bollinger Band has a unique support and pressure level, which is particularly important. Refer to the picture above. When the trend is downward, each lower rail is  Its support level, each middle rail, is its resistance level. When the trend is upward, the middle rail becomes a support level. The upper rail becomes a resistance level. When the trend goes flat, the lower rail becomes a support level.  The rail support and upper rail resistance are also very clear, so you can take a look. During the course of this trend, the support pressure changes with the trend. It is not said to be static and non-zero. It is often relatively standard, although sometimes it may occur.  Leo, the middle rail here is the resistance. Hey, this period has risen so sharply, and it has risen so high. It has almost reached the upper rail before retracing. Sometimes it will exceed the limit, but in fact, this is just a strong rebound. You can  Seeing that after a short-term shock, it still returned to a lower track and restarted near the lower track. Here, we need to refer to multi-cycle changes to better solve it. So before that, everyone remembers that the Bollinger Band is the only one.  Support pressure is particularly easy to use. You don’t have to think too much and can quickly determine whether this position is resistance or support in the short term. This is a very important point for trading. The third point is to show the strength of the trend. The strength of the trend. It doesn’t mean that if the middle track of the non-zero line goes down, it means it falls, and if it goes up, it means the strength of the upward trend. It means the main rising wave and the main falling wave. What is the main sound? We can see that when the non-zero line opens on the upper track, it is the main sound.  Sounds like you have this kind of stock price that continues to stretch along the non-zero line and starts to push up the upper rail. This is called the upper rail opening. You can see that after the upper rail opens, there will often be a violent rise. Different cycles have different upward trends.  The strength of the track opening is different. If the daily track opens, it may only be so long. But if it is a monthly track opening, then just like this bull market, it will grow very quickly, doubling or even tripling, so everyone  We should pay attention to different cycles. The same is true for declines. Once it opens on the lower track, it will start to fall again and again. You can see that once the lower track opens, it starts to turn lower, keeps falling, and keeps retracing. So this  Everyone should note that it can help you judge whether the current trend is an ordinary upward trend or has entered a strong downward trend with a main rising wave or a main falling wave. Therefore, everyone must understand what the current market is during the trading process. If the intensity is at the oscillation intensity, then you should do it according to the intensity of the oscillation. If the upper track runs and the lower track is slower, if it is the main rising intensity, then you should do it according to the intensity. You cannot say that when the upper track runs and the main rises, it is stronger. If it will rise along the upper track for a larger increase, then you may have to use the upper track as a support to make a low buy and enter the main down wave. Then you should also pay attention. Don’t think that the lower track can support it. It will often  If it continues to fall, your support will often be at the position where it breaks through the lower rail. It may fall further than the lower rail, and it may even take a sharp decline to effectively reduce the decline. Everyone must understand this. Okay, so after talking about a basic application of these Bollinger Bands, the second point? Let’s talk about the 12 buying and selling points of the Bollinger Bands. You know what the meaning of the Bollinger Bands is. So where are the specific buying and selling points? Here they are. The commander has summarized it for everyone. It is actually very simple. 1. Buy for oversold rebounds. 2. Buy for rebound. 2. Buy for the lower rail. 3. Buy for the breakthrough of the middle rail. 4. Buy for the middle rail. 5. Buy for the upper rail. 6. Buy for the upper rail. This means non-stop.  A market with relatively low intensity is one that rebounds from oversolds and returns to the lower track, while a market that breaks through the middle track and steps back to the middle track is a medium market intensity. Finally, the market intensity is that of an upper or lower track and a return to the upper track.  A strong one will rise well. Then let’s look directly at the first oversold rebound. What is an oversold rebound? A rebound that falls below the lower rail is called an oversold rebound. For example, let’s see here, right? If it falls below the lower rail, then it will stand on the upper rail or the lower rail again.  The line near the lower rail is called an oversold rebound. It is often the first positive line after falling below the lower rail. Pay attention to the first green line after falling below the lower rail. Successfully stand on the lower rail or near the lower rail.  The first reversal line is the most important line. Everyone must pay attention to it. It is an oversold rebound, which is what I just mentioned.  If you find or you are worried about the strength, then the next line will often touch the lower rail again, touch the lower rail again, and touch the lower rail again. Then when it touches the lower rail again, this point will be the point where you get on the train. Although at that time you  I must be very panicked. You can see that the market is going to be over, right? A big green column is very comfortable, but I must have been very panicked at that time. It should be a big red column, right? There should be a red column here, so everyone must pay attention.  Strength, but no matter what, this position is a buying point, which means that it has stood up again and stepped back to support the three-buy breakthrough of the middle track. In fact, this position is often safer and more stable. When the price stabilizes from the lower track and then slowly rises to When it breaks through the middle rail and breaks through the middle rail, its strength is often relatively strong. This position is a relatively safe confirmation of the buying point of Bollinger Bands. With the middle rail as the dividing line, standing above the middle rail is strong and below the middle rail is weak. Good 4 If you buy back and step on the middle track, if you step back on the middle track, the logic is the same as before. In the process of rising, he often likes to step back on you or chop back to give you a chance. In fact, it is also to wash out many recent prices. A line that is chasing high or has entered the market recently has wiped out all your stop losses, so this position is actually a good buying point. When it goes back to the middle track and then stands on the middle track again, it is a buying point. Let me be more specific.  When he steps back, you may be too scared to buy, no problem, but when he steps back and stands on the middle rail again, you have to pay attention. This position is a particularly good buying point, which is 4. Buy back and step on the middle rail.  You can buy the Shangchuan upper track only when the strength is enough. Generally, we use it in combination with multiple cycles. For example, the daily line is on the upper track, but the weekly line is all near the middle track support or near the lower track support. Then it can often effectively hold on to the upper track and continue to stretch upwards continuously and steadily. It can get out of a big market. This will be discussed later in the multi-cycle period. But everyone pays attention to this upper track.  There are requirements for strength. First, the middle rail of its Bollinger Band must be upward. If its middle rail of Bollinger Band is not upward, right, then you should not buy it. Secondly, it must be on the opening of the upper rail.  Well, this upper rail must open the upper rail. If the trend goes like this, the opening of the upper rail should be opened for it. Only then can you buy it. If it is a closing, right? If you have this kind of closing form, then he uploads it.  When you are on track, you have to pay attention to the fact that its resistance is very large and may not lead to success, so everyone must pay attention to it. Specifically, we still look at the use of multi-cycle. 6 buying is also the most difficult. As before, the main Shenglang must be strong here.  In a big cycle, if there is enough profit and loss ratio on the weekly line or the monthly line, you can buy this position and step on the upper track. This position has extremely high difficulty requirements. You must make sure that there is enough room in the big cycle before you buy. If there is a big cycle,  If there is no room or one line has reached the resistance level in the big cycle, then you should not try this buying method of stepping back to the upper track. Of course, sometimes the market will pick up, right? In this kind of market, the only thing you can really buy is to go back to the upper track.  Step on the top rail, right? Step on the top rail, step on the top rail, step on the top rail, step on the top rail, step on the top rail, step on the top rail, step on the top rail, step on the upper rail, step on the top rail, you want to buy at a lower position, sorry, no, this is one of the characteristics of the main rise, so what I just told you  The buying point among the 62 buying and selling points of the Bollinger Band is here. Let me tell you about a selling point of the Bollinger Band. The selling point is actually similar to the one just now, but in reverse, using the first one to stay away from the upper track, we can see that there are  After a round of rise, it moves away from the upper track and at the same time reaches the top of some large cycles, right? You use the upper track of the weekly line and the upper track of the cross-line, right? Especially when the big cycle is far away, this is often a better one.  The selling point is because this position can be said to be the last charge of the main rising wave, so when it falls, it is often relatively violent. If you think about it, everyone has lost control of their emotions and everyone is crazily squeezing in. Then it can create such a strong intensity. When everyone has entered, right, and everyone has bought, then there will definitely be some smart people who will react to the market. Is there any incremental capital coming in, right? If there is no incremental capital coming in, what should I do? Then just run first. So,  This position is often the first line. Everyone must pay attention to it. It is a good opportunity. A good opportunity. The second line has fallen off the rails. It may be the first line, right. At this position, you say, handsome, I dare not buy this.  The pulse at the location is too strong. I'm scared. That's no problem. When he falls onto the rails, everyone will know it in their hearts. Let everyone who responds quickly understand that Ray has fallen onto the rails. If the Bollinger Band falls onto the rails, it should start from  Where to go? It has to fall from the upper track to the middle track. This is its basic falling space. So you think, it will have to fall to this position in the future. But you can't run on the upper track, right? So there are many times when it falls on the upper track. This is the position of our second channel. It has clearly told you that the strength is not enough, right? Maybe you were still hesitant and entangled when you were in the first channel. The second channel has already told you that many people have run away. What are you still afraid of, right?  The third pulse is to touch the upper rail. Sometimes after falling, he will touch the upper rail. Sometimes he may pull this upper lead or this kind of upper lead, right, and touch the upper track upward. Finally, he will touch the upper track. Attracting others to be fooled can also be said to be the last rebound force. In this case, it is often a selling point. That is, when he touches the upper rail but cannot stand on the upper rail, then he is a selling point for you.  If you can't stand up, it means nothing. It means the bulls are weak. All the upward attack power has been fired out. All the bullets have hit it and it still can't be hit. What should I do? Then run away, right? Then withdraw. Everyone, please pay attention. It 's us who are on the track.  One of the three pulse points, if you touch the upper rail and the fourth pulse, it will fall below the middle rail. So this position is no longer a simple callback. Generally, everyone knows that the callback will not be effective and fall on the upper rail, because this is called a callback. Step on it fiercely.  The middle rail immediately rebounds, or this is called a callback, right? It's a boast. If you step on the middle rail and don't fall below it, continue to go up. This is called a callback. If it falls below the middle rail, it means the trend is over, right. Just like this, we can see After falling below the middle track, it will not be a simple pullback. You can already understand that it is over, so this position must be a good selling point, because once it is over, it will be even more difficult for him to stand on the middle track. You can see that the next few rebounds have not reached the middle track, so this position is actually a good selling point at the end of a trend. It seems that it has fallen for a while, but in fact your profit margin is still very generous, which is helpless.  Touch back to the middle rail. Sometimes if it falls below, it will still touch up, right? In fact, the logic of touching back to the upper rail is the same, which is to confirm that the characteristic of this place is to confirm that the strength of its rebound is insufficient, right?  There are many bulls a. I think the trend is not over, so I should rush in, right? Many people are buying at low prices, many people are on the grid, right, many people are rushing in with various average costs, and they find that they can’t move, so what should I do? What should I do if I can’t bounce? Then it’s very simple. Hurry up and a big negative line falls. So this retracement of the middle rail is the same as the retracement of the upper rail. It is also a confirmation of strength. Only if it is strong enough and confirmed, can it stand on it. Otherwise,  He cannot stand on the six meridians. The opening of the lower rail may be here. Many friends think that this selling point does not seem to be very good. Indeed, there are many times around this selling point that may fluctuate around the cost, but it is also completely confirmed here.  When a major decline in the trend begins, it is no longer a short-term trend. When it ends, it is a major decline. So you can see that the subsequent decline is often more terrifying. It is often a steeper decline, which is opposite to the main wave.  In the short term, at this position, if you are slow here, you must be reacting slowly, right? You must not say that it is sold at the opening of the upper rail, or that it is sold at the upper rail of the return mold, sold at the middle rail of the return mold, and sold after falling below the middle rail. Their cost is definitely lower than yours, a lot lower, but this is the last selling point. After that, there will be no selling points. Why? Because after this, there are only buying points for oversold rebounds, right? There are no selling points, so this is the last chance. That is to say, if you are not sure of this position, don’t open a short order, right? You said there is still an opportunity behind this boss? What opportunity is this? This is a back touch in the middle track, not a six-meridian but a five-meridian touch.  The middle track is before this one, right? So everyone must pay attention. This is the last selling point. Then the commander just told everyone about the 12 buying and selling points of the Bollinger Band. You must remember it clearly in actual trading.  It is very useful and can help you easily determine the final buying and selling point. Next, let me tell you about the profit and loss ratio judgment method of Bollinger Bands, which is about your profit margin, right? You know where to buy and where to sell.  You have to know how much space you have, right? Then what is the space you sell from the upper rail to the middle rail, as the commander just told you, where is the space you sell from the upper rail to the middle rail, right? Where is the space you sell from the middle rail? And it is from the middle rail to  The lower rail, so you have to figure out how much your profit margin is, what your profit-loss ratio is, and where your stop loss and take profit should be. So here, how many pieces are divided into? The first piece is the lower rail, below to the bottom.  The profit margin for the second span is from the lower rail to the middle rail. The profit margin for the third span is from the middle rail to the upper rail. The profit margin for the fourth span is from the upper rail to the upper rail. Trading is the same.  It’s just that the profit margin is the opposite. Let me give you an example directly. Let’s take a simple example, like our one-buy oversold rebound, right? Then there is another one under the oversold rebound, which is a divergence, an oversold.  Right? Not to mention the rebound, if it is oversold, it is actually room. Because here we can see that this section is actually its oversold space, right? Obviously the lower track is support. If you still fall below the lower track, then this section  It is a space when it is oversold. Your profit space is to use it when you are oversold. When you buy in such a far distance and the market has fallen deeply, your profit space is from this position to the lower rail, including here, right?  If you fall very deep and break far beyond the lower rail, your profit margin will be from this position to the lower rail. It does not mean that you cannot continue to make profits, because we can see here, right, you can continue to make profits, and it can rise.  When it reaches the middle track, the safe profit margin or the latest profit margin is this period. It may be like this period, right. It can rise to the middle track, but it will fall again, right? So sometimes? You can still hold on to this profit margin and wait for it to fall, right? Then you can eat again. So everyone should pay attention to this. This is a profit margin, and it is also a basic ratio of your profit and loss ratio. You have to see it.  What is your profit margin if you buy at this position? To give you a simple example, you cannot say whether it is right to buy exactly at this lowest point. So assuming you buy at this position, then if you buy at this position, the profit margin is  How much? You have so much profit room, right? The higher you buy, the less your profit room is. So before buying, you have to calculate how much profit room you have, right ? For example, if you say hey, this position may have risen to  That's it, right? It's already near the lower track, so don't buy it. Your profit margin will be relatively small. If it goes straight to oversold and rebounds, it's okay. If it continues to fall, you will lose money. Everyone should pay attention to your profit margin.  The problem is that you must make sure that you have enough profit margin for each transaction. Then the second point is the profit margin from the lower track to the middle track. This is the most common and the most common one for us when it is oversold. From the lower track to the middle track. This section is actually relatively stable. This space is often relatively large. If you can follow the previous discipline to buy points and step on the lower rail to buy, step back and step on the lower rail to buy, then it will be almost completely normal for you to finish the entire section. rail to middle rail, so if you buy on the lower rail, where should you set your index profit to be on the middle rail? If you are conservative, you think the resistance of the middle rail is greater, right? Then you should set it a little lower than the middle rail. If this happens  If the trend is relatively strong, oversold, or the market intensity is relatively strong, then you can set it a little above the middle track, right? If you say you want to eat more, then you can continuously increase the trailing stop loss and raise the stop loss upwards.  That's it. If it rises to the upper track, you can continue to raise it, right? So anyway, you first figure out how much money you can make, right? In this wave of market conditions, at least your profit margin should be at this position. For the sake of safety, your profit  The profit margin should be at this position. If you understand this, you will know how much money you can probably make from this transaction. So the profit margin from the middle track to the upper track is often very simple. This is very simple, and this section is often long.  It's relatively fast. If the market strength is really strong enough, one K-line and two K-lines will usually grow up, including here. He usually doesn't ink for too long, so this section is actually the one I prefer to do long because it is faster.  The green pillar will grow up. It will not rise like this from the lower rail to the middle rail. You see how uncomfortable it is. Little by little, it will get stuck. It will increase for you for five or six days, right? We can compare it here.  The next time it goes up, it will rise for three or four days, right? If the middle time goes up, it will go up for one day. So everyone, please pay attention. Generally speaking, it is more comfortable to go long. Or if you say you want to make quick money, then you must  Pay attention to the profit margin in this period of rising from the middle track. For the same safety reason, you can set it a little bit below the upper track, right? Predict some resistance in advance and then be safe. If you think it is strong enough, you can take more.  There is no problem at all. Finally, there is a profit margin above the upper track that can only be encountered in the main promotion stage. This is the example given by the commander before. When he is very strong, he is a profit margin above the upper track.  Is the path right? There is a lot of room for profit, but sometimes the room for profit is sustainable. That is to say, once the main upgrade starts, it will not end easily, so this profit space is often sustainable and continuous.  It's not like one line and two lines like before, so you have to understand different market strengths, your profit margins are different, and your time is also different, right? This is very important.  Yes, everyone talks about the four important aspects of this market: volume, price, time and space, right? Of course Jiang An likes to talk about price, time, space and resistance levels. I think Jiang An is more accurate, but no matter what  Well, if you understand these 4 points, they are the most important combination. Now, let me tell you how to improve the winning rate. The multi-period judgment method of Bollinger Bands is that sometimes your stop loss can be set higher or full.  Ah, sometimes you have to shoot a little less. What is the difference? The difference is whether you have triggered a change in the big cycle. To give a simple example, you have a small cycle, and there is so much space from the middle track to the upper track, but the big cycle will already be there.  It's near the middle track and there's only a little space from the upper track. So you must be setting it up according to the space of the big cycle. You can't say, oh, you're still complaining about the small cycle, why did it start to fall before it even reached the upper track? Then you will be trapped after a while, so you must understand different cycles and their importance is different. The most important thing is definitely the big cycle first and then the small cycle, right? So everyone must pay attention to including your buying and selling. When buying, try to buy at a support of the big cycle. When selling, try to sell at a resistance of the big cycle. Your winning rate will be much higher. Let’s take a look at using this paragraph. The commander has cut it out and it is this.  You can take a look at the recent market situation. Here is the monthly cycle, then the weekly cycle, and then the daily cycle, right? First of all, it is very simple to cross the line cycle. What trend does it follow? It follows a backtrack, but it is on track.  The trend is right, one pulse is far away from the upper track, the second pulse is falling to the upper rail, he has already touched the upper rail with three pulses, already telling you that the strength is not enough, right? With such a big cycle, his room for decline is very large, so switch to the weekly line.  If you can't hold the position of the weekly line, where will it fall? Towards the middle rail, right? The upper rail to the middle rail is a space for its exchange of forces. Then if you open a short order on the upper rail, your guidance will be there.  If it is in the middle track, then in this range, you should not go long easily, right? Although you said that if it is oversold here, it will rebound, and if it is oversold, it will rebound. But the trend is still downward, so you should be careful not to be easily fooled.  The main logic behind washing you is to go short on the rebound, right? If you go short on the rebound, go short on the rebound, go short on the rebound, you go short until it falls to the mid-rail. The profit margin is gone, right? You have to be more cautious. Don't say it's near the mid-rail.  Open short unless it effectively falls below the middle rail, so there are still 12 buying points and selling points. Everyone must pay attention to it. So how do you open an order corresponding to the small cycle? Right, it rebounds to the non-zero line and the middle rail, opens short, rebounds to the non-zero line, and opens the middle rail.  If you are short, it is so simple to get out of the market and get out of the market. So if you combine the big and small cycles, you will know the big cycle, right? The weekly and monthly lines represent what kind of market you are doing, so you can make a  Firm airdrop, right? In small cycles, you can go long. You can go long, but you have to be more conservative. And the decline in large cycles is relatively strong. So in small cycles, your index profit range will be smaller, right?  It's so stupid. Don't shoot too high, otherwise he won't be able to touch the middle rail and retreat. Then you won't suffer a loss, right? When you are short, you should be bold and do it right, because he stands on the middle rail. Such a position  When it starts to fluctuate, you can directly add short positions. Even if it sometimes surges, you can also add short positions in batches because you know that the big cycle is downward, so you do n’t have to worry. At least, you don’t have to worry about it when it falls near the mid-rail.  Well, you will find that every time the rebound is stronger, it is near the middle rail. Only when it is close to the middle rail will it have an effective rebound. When it is far from the middle rail, it will not have much rebound strength, right? You put this  It's very simple to understand. The second one is the same for the rise, because when it rises, the big cycle is near the middle track. This is the monthly line, that is, m, weekly line, w, daily line, d, if it is a big cycle.  Well, you see that it has stabilized near the mid-rail and is rising. What are you afraid of? You see that it has stabilized near the mid-rail of the large cycle and is standing above the mid-rail. It has crossed the mid-rail at the weekly level. What is this, right? This is our buying point. Then  You have to pay attention. Then when the corresponding small cycle crosses the middle track, do you buy it? Then you know that the big cycle has not grown to the upper track, right? The monthly line has not grown to the upper track, and the weekly line has not grown to the upper track. Before you  Just buy it, right? On the upper rail of Shangchuan, you still buy it. If you step on the upper rail, you still buy it. You don’t have to worry about whether it’s right or not. That’s why sometimes your judgments are different for the same strength. That is to combine multiple cycles to judge the big trend.  When the cycle is rising, right? If it doesn't rise to the monthly resistance level, and when it doesn't rise to the weekly resistance level, just buy according to the 6 buying points on the daily line, right? If there is no oversold rebound here, just buy and cross the middle track.  Ah, or buy it back and step on the middle track. 2 Buy it and upload it to the upper track, right? 3 Buy this and step on the upper track. You're right. This is the attached sound. Just add more positions. So everyone must understand this. This is the big picture.  A rise in cycles and small cycles is an overall change. You have to understand the fifth point. To improve the winning rate, you cannot combine channels with multiple cycles. This is also a very important point. What is the combination of multiple cycles? The combination of multiple systems.  In fact, you can continue to add some systems to help you ensure your success. Let me give you a simple example of multi-system. What is multi-system? Is it correct to use it? We can combine it to improve the winning rate of non-zero lines. Use KDJ to improve it, right? Short-term confirmation, a powerful system improves the confirmation of divergence, and trading volume improves the confirmation of breakthrough. Of course, the commander only gave you 3 examples here. In fact, there are definitely more than 3. You can continue to add them yourself. Look.  Which system you use is better or you are more accustomed to it. You can combine them to add this. This is particularly good. You must pay attention to this simple example. The first one is KDJ. KDJ. Everyone knows that generally we  Used to judge short-term strength, we can see that there are many oversold rebounds at this position that is not zero, right? So before the oversold rebound, we know if we buy an oversold rebound, can we buy it? We can use this KDJ to add one  Auxiliary judgment, because we see that KDJ has a golden cross here, then the confirmation of this buying point will be higher, right? The buying point here will be more accurate, because KDJ has a golden cross, we can see that it will continue to rebound, including here, right KDJ  If there is a golden cross in KDJ, we can see that he will continue to rebound, right? If KDJ does not have a golden cross, then we can see that his strength is not enough, right? Niu was in the front, right? There is no golden cross in these periods of decline, so his rebound  The strength will be relatively weak, including the fact that there is no golden cross in these paragraphs, so it will continue to fall. So here, the commander will share with you that you can use KDJ to judge whether the strength of this oversold rebound is confirmed enough or not.  It’s not enough, it’s still half and a half, so everyone should pay attention. You can use this to judge whether the oversold rebound is enough. The KDJ golden cross will be more stable in the future. And in addition, there is this certainty that the handsome man shared with you before. Vivo's powerful system, including Dashuai, has given this code to everyone. The best one to use in the powerful system is Beni. If you use divergence, your success rate will be higher because you can take a look, right? The last two are bottom divergence and after bottom divergence.  Then he often starts to rebound, and he starts to pull the Yang line. You use this to pull a big green line, right? This is directly the bottom of a stage line. So if it deviates from the top, you will find this position when you look at it. He often talks endlessly about the top divergence. The commander has already told you about the strong system before, so I won’t go into more details here. The divergence of the strong system is very useful. The flat bottom divergence directly represents the strength of the market. When there is a divergence,  There are often short-term opportunities. You can buy and then keep raising the stop loss. When you want to sell, keep the stop loss lower. This will ensure that you can eat a lot of meat easily. The commander thinks  The third point, which is still more comfortable, is the confirmation of the breakthrough. We often use the trading volume instead, right, to take advantage of this rise. If we don’t increase the volume, its confirmation is very poor, including here, right, especially the initial rise. When the Bollinger Band rises from the middle track to the upper track, it must increase the volume. Everyone must pay attention. It is the Bollinger Band that grows from the middle track to the upper track, pulls from the middle track to the upper track, and gets stuck from the middle track to the upper track.  What 's important is to increase the amount. If you don't increase the amount, its intensity is often not enough. So everyone must pay attention to whether the intensity of his amount of energy is enough or not. In this case, it can better help you judge the accuracy. Of course,  There are many more. The commander will not give you examples one by one here. Okay, thank you very much friends for listening to one of the content of the commander. In this class, I will tell you the 12 trading methods of Bollinger Bands, including  How to improve your winning rate? Each position is very particular. Then how to pass through multiple cycles and how to pass through multiple systems. Everyone must pay attention to that every position is very particular. Each buying point is very precise.
