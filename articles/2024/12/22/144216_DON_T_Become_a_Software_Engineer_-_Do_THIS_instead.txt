Description:
Okay, here's a structured summary of the core ideas:

**I. The Shifting Landscape of Software Engineering**
   *   AI is automating core coding tasks, reducing the demand for entry-level coders and devaluing coding skills.
   *   The job market is saturated with software engineering applicants, with increased competition for entry-level positions.
   *   Outsourcing is a growing trend, further impacting job security and salary expectations for developers in the US and UK.

**II. Cloud Engineering as an Alternative**
   *   The cloud computing market is rapidly expanding, creating significant opportunities.
   *   There's a significant skills gap in cloud engineering, with companies actively seeking qualified professionals.
   *   Cloud engineering offers diverse career paths, with roles ranging from architecture to security implementation.

**III. Key Advantages of Cloud Engineering:**
   *   Easier to enter with a faster learning curve than traditional software engineering.
   *   High demand for specialized cloud skills in a growing market.
   *   Opportunities to develop valuable software engineering skills within the cloud domain.

**Fundamental Point:** In today's tech landscape, cloud engineering presents a more promising career path than traditional software engineering due to the current high demand for cloud skills, the growth in this market, and saturation in the general software engineering market.

98.7% of software engineering applicants never even get a phone interview I used to be part of that statistic now I make $50,000 a month and this happened because I changed one simple thing that anyone can do and Achieve similar results hi I'm San I'm A Cloud engineer and I run my own cloud security consultancy with a decade of experience in this field I've seen how the landscape is Shifting I used to be a front-end developer but then I discovered that companies are hungry for something different and I knew if I took advantage of this it would put me in the top 1% of earners I use this insight to not only transform my own career but hundreds of students inside of my Academy what was this Insight don't actually become a software engineer and today I'm going to reveal the three reasons why and what you should do instead now software engineering is actually undergoing a huge shift thank to artificial intelligence when I started as a front-end developer I wrote every line of code myself but in 2024 that's becoming a thing of the past AI isn't just handling simple tasks anymore it's designing user interfaces writing complex algorithms and even architecting entire systems let's take Devon for example the world's first fully autonomous AI software engineer Devon can plan analyze and execute complex coding tasks with just a single prompt on the software engineering bench a platform for testing AI on real world coding issues Deon solved 13.86% of all problems end to end that's nearly 10x higher than everyone's favorite chat gbd4 at 1.74% but it's not just Devon cursor AI is a tool that helps programmers write code faster it can automatically suggest or complete the code a programmer is writing this tool is changing how software is made by making code quicker and easier for many developers around the world but also non-developers too Andre car co-founder of open Ai and former director of AI at Tesla recently said that automating software engineering will look similar to automating driving his vision suggests a significant shift in the role of software developers in the future instead of writing detailed code developers will focus more on High level planning and problem solving whilst AI handles the nitty-gritty coding task to be honest software engineering has never been about writing code it's been about solving problems because I think writing code is the easy part this shift will translate to job losses and less job openings for entry-level coding positions because suddenly AI is doing the majority of the heavy lifting it will also devalue the skill of coding itself and increase the barrier to entry for new developers because now Hands-On coding experience isn't as relevant anymore secondly something which brings me to the days when I was working as a front-end developer it used to be that getting a computer science degree pretty much guaranteed you a job when you graduated but in 2024 the software engineering job market has become incredibly competitive and I've seen this firsthand recently I posted an ad for an entry-level developer position at my cloud security consultancy it was for a junior role requiring only basic coding skills and maybe a year or two of experience and guess how many applications we received over 500 for one job and many of these applicants were overqualified with years of experience and impressive portfolios now to put this into perspective as well every day I have applications come through in my email of people offering to work for me for free and I'm looking at SCV 5 years of experience in the industry which is crazy and that leaves me thinking how has this happened and I think there's a few factors in play here firstly we've seen an explosion of coding boot cams over the last decade now I attended one of these many years ago and yes they really helped me on my journey and yes we need training and upskilling but we're also flooding the job market with entrylevel developers and there aren't enough open positions to absorb this many people secondly online learning platforms like corera and udemy have made it easier than ever for people to learn coding skills on their own and again I'm not blaming people here but my point is that this is also contributing to the job market saturation and to add to that there's been a big push in the last 10 years encouraging everyone to learn coding it's been presented as a ticket to a high-paying secure job while this can be true it's also led to a surge of people entering the field and and not all of them are actually passionate about software engineering next up the trend of Outsourcing in the software industry continues to grow in 2024 with advanced communication Technologies project management tools and a global talent pool readily accessible the barriers to Outsourcing has significantly decreased this ease of access to International Talent has made it increasingly attractive for companies to look beyond their local markets for software development needs the pressure to Outsource is further intensified by the duty that public traded companies have today shareholders businesses are expected to maximize profits and operate as efficiently as possible if Outsourcing can significantly reduce the cost without compromising quality many companies feel obligated to pursue this option to remain competitive and deliver value to their shareholders this isn't anything new Outsourcing has been happening for decades but every year this part of the industry is growing in fact the it Outsourcing Market is worth $512 billion and expected to grow to 812 billion by 2029 when I used to work full-time one of our teams was downside as their jobs were all moved to Offshore Development Centers this shift keeps happening offshore onshore but is becoming more common in the industry and this trend is particularly strong in countries like India leading to increase employment higher wages and improved living standards for many which is awesome however this trend has also created challenges for software engineers in the US and in the UK when businesses can access equally skilled developers willing to work for significantly less wages it becomes difficult to justify higher salaries in more expensive markets now of course there is pros and cons to Outsourcing to different countries and all of this adds up to a situation where job security which used to be a big perk of being a software engineer is no longer a sure thing I don't think that this is inherently bad those that are smart will stay ahead of the game and Niche down or specialize in high demand areas but for me there's an alternative solution where you can learn a high in skill that's seeing explosive growth in the next 5 years what's this alternative it's Cloud engineering so what is cloud engineering while think of the cloud as a giant network of powerful computers spread all over the world instead of keeping all your files and programs on your personal computer you can store and access them through these remote computers via the Internet Cloud engineering is the job of setting up managing and improving this network of computers to help businesses run their online services smoothly let's use Netflix as an example so Netflix uses the cloud to store their huge library of movies and TV shows on computers around the world called servers allowing millions of people to stream videos simultaneously without any Interruption Cloud engineers then ensure that when you press play the video starts instantly load smoothly and adjust to your internet speed all while keeping your viewing data secure and powering features like personaliz recommendations on your Netflix home screen now you're probably thinking why is cloud engineering the solution salon and that is a great question well the cloud computing Market is exploding with projection showing it will reach a $1.6 trillion Market by 2030 in other words it's going to be a sea of opportunities for those who position themselves correctly companies of all sizes from startups to Big Tech corporations are migrating to the cloud and they are Desperately Seeking the need for skilled professionals to guide them through this transition and here is the secret there's a massive skills Gap in this industry Gartner a leading research company predicts that by next year over 95% of new digital workflows will be deployed on cloud native platforms there's a survey done of 500 it decision makers to understand how the cloud skill shortage is affecting it teams nearly all 98% of global organizations surveyed are facing a cloud skills Gap do you see the opportunity here and that's why I made the switch to Cloud engineering all those years ago and I noticed an immediate shift in my career trajectory at the time I was working as a technical architect but I quit this job as soon as I realized that I wanted to work in the cloud the growing nature of the industry caught my attention and I recognized that my current role wasn't aligned with my aspirations with savings to fall back on I bet on myself and giving myself a Freemon window to land a new job in Cloud engineering after a couple of months I found that instead of competing against thousands of other applicants for a single position I was being approached by recruiters companies were actively seeking me out and it was a complete 180 from from my experience in software engineering another reason is the diversity of career paths that cloud engineering offers you're not pigeon hold into a single role one day you might be architecting a scalable Cloud infrastructure the next you might be implementing security measures to protect sensitive data now my own journey is a testament to this I started as a technical architect then I delved into devops and then deeper into Cloud engineering and now I run my own cloud security consultancy each step of the way I've developed a broader set of skills and honestly it doesn't even feel like work most of the time the satisfaction that I get from completing projects and seeing their immediate impact is unrivaled for example in one of my first projects we had just finished migrating a client's infrastructure to the cloud in the first month after the migration they saw a 40% reduction in it cost and their websites were running 30% faster and a pro tip if you canti your skills and work to direct positive outcomes for businesses and their bottom line employers will take notice of you cuz remember fundamentally we're just solving business problems now you might be thinking this all sounds great but how do I get started well the beautiful truth is that you don't need a technical background to begin how do I know this my cloud engineer Academy takes you from someone with no prior experience to job ready Cloud engineer in just 12 weeks I compiled the exact road map that I used to make my switch in 3 months into a self-paced course that anyone can take it's very much Hands-On and you'll be building a portfolio of project projects that employers are Desperately Seeking and when you join you get access to an active Discord community and monthly life calls with and Mastermind workshops with industry experts Link in the description now let me address a concern that I often hear won Cloud engineering becomes saturated too it's a valid question but I don't think so why firstly the cloud Market is still in the growth phase Satia nadela CEO of Microsoft emphasizes that the cloud is not just about cost savings it's about creating new business models new customer experiences and new ways of working so while software engineering has been around for decades widespread Cloud adoption is relatively recent we're still in the early stages of this technological shift with many companies yet to make their move to the cloud secondly Cloud Technologies are constantly evolving new services and tools are being introduced creating new specializations within this field wner vocals CTO of Amazon says in the old world you devoted 70% of your time to the heavy lifting of it and 30% of your time to Innovation cloud computing offers the opposite promises you 70% of innovation and 30% of Maintenance This Promise of innovation means there's always room for experts in emerging Cloud Technologies and lastly Cloud engineering isn't just about technical skills it's about understanding business needs and translating them into Technical Solutions this combination of Technical and business acument is harder to automate or Outsource providing more job security in the long run now let's talk about the future future with the rise of edge Computing the internet of things and advanced AI applications are all closely tied to Cloud Technologies by choosing a career in Cloud engineering you're positioning yourself at the intersection of these exciting developments but I want to be transparent no career is about its challenges Cloud engineering can be demanding for example continuous learning is mandatory in this field as it is with software engineering and virtually every Tech Career AWS is releasing new Services all of the time so that learning never stops but for me it's actually exciting to be at the Forefront of new technology so I'm always learning more out of choice rather than having to do it so what is a takeaway from all of this yes software engineering remains a viable career path in a tech industry they play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of applications systems and platforms that power our digital world and with AI you can now learn coding without any excuses for cloud Engineers they are indispensable as they create the software that runs on the cloud infrastructure developing apis for cloud services and build tools for managing and monitoring Cloud resources while concerns about the AI impacts on the field are valid it's important to note that the top tier software Engineers are leveraging AI to dramatically increase their efficiency and productivity now you're going to get the 1% go into 0.1% software Engineers these professionals are using AI power tools to automate routine tasks or debug issues allowing them to focus on higher level problem solving and Innovation and yes even in the cloud AI is making its inroads but to stay ahead of the curve Cloud Engineers must focus on areas where human expertise remains critical this includes architectural design or security implementation which is what my cloud security consultancy specializes in and this is the key principle for those just entering the tech industry Cloud engineering presents a better option it's easier to learn and there's a huge variety of areas that you can work in Cloud Engineers often have the opportunity to develop software engineering skills as part of their role for instance in my Academy we teach bash and python this combination of cloud expertise and programming skills makes Cloud Engineers particularly valuable in the job market as they can bridge the gap between infrastructure management and application development now if you want the exact road map that I took when I quit my job and landed a cloud roll in 3 months check out this video so you can make the switch to Cloud engineering as well
