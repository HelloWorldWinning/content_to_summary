Description:
This text discusses a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approach to treating “jie jie,” which translates to nodules or masses. It emphasizes that this condition and its treatment are not new, referencing historical figures like Sun Simiao and Zhang Zhongjing who studied it. Key points include:

*   **Historical Context:** "Jie jie" is not a recent ailment; it's been documented since ancient times, with numerous folk remedies existing for it.
*   **Sun Simiao's Approach:** The text highlights a simple yet effective method attributed to Sun Simiao: using a foot soak to disperse these nodules.
*   **The Wen Dan Tang (Warm the Gallbladder Decoction):** This formula is presented as a key solution, with documented benefits such as "drying dampness, warming Yang, and transforming phlegm" to address the issue of pseudo-nodules, qi stagnation, and other similar issues.
*   **Wen Dan Tang Ingredients and Function:** The formula includes Pinellia, Chen Pi (orange peel), Fuling (Poria), Zhuru (bamboo shavings), Zhi Shi (immature bitter orange), and Zhi Gan Cao (prepared licorice root). The text details how each herb works together to achieve the desired effect:
    *   **Pinellia and Fuling:** Transform phlegm and guide it downward, addressing mental stagnation.
    *   **Chen Pi and Zhuru:** Act quickly to promote the downward movement of qi and phlegm.
    *   **Zhi Shi:** Facilitates the descending movement of qi.
    *   **Zhi Gan Cao:** Harmonizes the overall formula.
*   **Mechanism of Action:** The combination of herbs aims to clear the gallbladder, regulate its qi flow, and eliminate phlegm. This addresses the root cause of the nodules, which the text suggests is related to phlegm accumulation.
*   **Ease of Use:** The formula's simplicity, requiring only a foot soak, showcases its potency in dispersing nodules.
*   **Benefits Beyond Nodules:** Besides dispersing nodules, the foot soak method improves blood circulation, activates energy, soothes the liver, regulates qi, and resolves phlegm.
*   **Gentle Nature:** The formula is described as "warm and gentle," unlike some harsh methods that can be damaging. It restores the body’s warmth and vitality, rather than depleting it.

In summary, the text promotes the use of a specific TCM formula, the Wen Dan Tang, administered through a foot soak, as a gentle and effective treatment for various forms of "jie jie" (nodules), by targeting the underlying issue of phlegm accumulation and imbalance in qi flow. It emphasizes the historical basis and the balanced nature of the treatment.
