**主题：** 人工智能代理（AI Agents）全面解析

**核心内容：**

这段视频主要探讨了当前加密货币领域最热门的趋势——人工智能代理（AI Agents），并进行了全面的分析。内容涵盖了以下几个方面：

1.  **什么是人工智能代理？**
    *   简单来说，人工智能代理是附加了可编程大型语言模型的机器人。
    *   它们是能够自主做出决策、执行行动以完成特定任务的软件。
    *   它们具备规划、短期记忆，并可以使用各种工具来执行任务。
    *   通过不断学习和改进，它们会随着时间的推移变得更好，这得益于机器学习。

2.  **现实世界中的人工智能代理：**
    *   我们日常生活中已经广泛使用了人工智能代理，例如：虚拟助手（Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant）、聊天机器人、机器人代理（Tesla, Weo）、工业特定代理、智能家居温度调节代理、代码编写助手（Copilot, Code GPT）、知识产权代理、健康诊断代理等。

3.  **加密货币领域的人工智能代理：**
    *   加密货币的透明性、代币化、流动性、资金、速度、所有权、无许可访问、24/7可用性以及开源性等核心原则，都为人工智能代理提供了巨大的发展空间。
    *   人工智能代理在加密货币领域正蓬勃发展。
    *   主要有三个原因：
        *   **代币化：** 可以被代币化，因此具有投机属性。
        *   **创新：** 新颖且具有创新性。
        *   **关注：** 受到了广泛的关注。

4.  **人工智能代理的类别：**
    *   **Meme (模因):**  纯粹为了娱乐或吸引关注而存在。例如：
        *   **Goat:**  源自“无限后室”概念，其代币曾达到惊人的市值。
        *   **fcoin:** 与Goat有一定的关联，但更多的是一个模因币。
    *   **Platforms (平台):** 提供创建和托管人工智能代理的平台。例如：
        *   **Virtuals:**  人工智能代理的Launchpad，允许用户创建自己的代理。
        *   **Spectral:** 风投支持的AI协议，提供交易代理等多种产品。
        *   **Hollow World:** 允许用户创建具有2D或3D模型的人工智能代理。
        *   **VV Fu:**  另一个人工智能代理Launchpad，允许用户启动自己的代理代币。
        *   **My Show:**  提供各种人工智能应用程序的代理应用商店。
        *   **Hold Station:** 另一个用户启动人工智能代理的平台。
    *   **Frameworks (框架):** 构建所有人工智能代理的基础层，例如：
        *   **AI 16z (Eliza Framework):** 由AI 16z创建，被广泛使用。
        *   **Zerro:**  起初是娱乐人工智能代理，现在也有自己的框架。
        *   **Rig (Arc):** 基于Rust的框架，主要面向Solana生态系统。
    *   **Modules (模块) / Individual Agents (个体代理):** 基于框架构建的应用程序，例如：
        *   **axt:** 基于Virtuals框架的加密货币内容创建者，可以24小时发推特。
        *   **Talis:**  通过链上代理操作将DeFi带给人工智能代理，具有自己的钱包，可以进行交易、收益耕作等。
        *   **Lowkey:**  链上Alpha的人工智能代理终端，持有代币才能访问。
        *   **Beats AI:**  基于Hyperliquid的人工智能音乐生成代理。
        *   **Nikita:** 基于Base的信息KOL人工智能代理。
        *   **Bully:** 在CT上回复并怼人的代理。
        *   **Hack:**  用于审计智能合约的白帽黑客代理。
    *   **Tooling (工具):**  为人工智能代理提供工具和基础设施的代理。例如：
        *   **fxn:**  利用“swarms”概念实现不同框架的代理之间的交互。
        *   **Cookies AI:**  提供人工智能代理代币的追踪数据和指标。
        *   **Story Protocol:**  实现代理之间的交互和IP集成。

5.  **当前市场状况：**
    *   目前人工智能代理的总市值约为200亿美元（可能略低）。
    *   对比之下，整个加密货币市场市值为3.8万亿美元，表明人工智能代理市场仍有巨大增长空间。
    *   人工智能代理是否是新一轮DeFi夏季？ 它们有很多相似之处，但目前人工智能代理仅占加密货币总市值的0.5%。 DeFi在上一周期达到顶峰时占据了6.7%的市场份额。
    *   当前，人工智能在加密货币领域占据了绝大部分的关注度。

6.  **未来展望：**
    *   人工智能代理的价值应该达到多少？ 1000亿美元（目前市值的5倍）是合理的，可能最终会达到2000亿美元（10倍）甚至5000亿美元（50倍）。
    *   人工智能代理领域仍处于早期阶段，未来发展潜力巨大。
    *   建议关注框架、工具和模块等不同类型的代理，并进行多元化投资。

**总结：**

人工智能代理是当前加密货币领域最受关注的创新技术之一。它不仅具有巨大的潜力，而且与DeFi等其他领域也有着密切的联系。 尽管市场仍处于早期阶段，但其未来的增长空间巨大。投资者应关注这一领域的动态，并根据自身风险承受能力和投资策略进行布局。

now all of you by now are well aware of probably the biggest meta that we've had all cycle so far yes it's AI agents today we're going to cover everything that you need to know about the AI agent space some of the big players we'll talk about how some of them work as well as well as some of my thoughts about where this overall sector can actually go so I think you'll enjoy this one it's a little bit different more of a high level overview uh but it will cover lots of things so if you're new to AI agents I think you'll definitely get something out of this so um we we cover a few different things in this one first of all covering like what what actually agents are some of the different categories and then we'll cover some of the agents that we have today in crypto what they do and some speculation uh talk as well uh which I think will be fun so first of all like what are agents um or AI agents I should say and I guess to put it simply they are essentially some sort of Bot with a programmable larg language model attached to it uh that you can train to complete specific tasks so essentially they're like this autonomous software um that is able to actually make decisions is able to actually do things and take action to achieve certain tasks uh they can plan they have some memory they do have some short-term memory um and uh they can use various different Tools in order to kind of execute these actions so as I've made in this diagram here you can uh give these agents or give this kind of Bot some knowledge you can train it give it some abilities uh and then through all of those through those three things it can complete some actions and over the course of time it will learn from its mistakes and improve and you'll get this kind of uh cycle of more actions leads to more mistakes which will lead to more improvements and then it will get better and better and that's one of the key things about it AI agents evolve and get better with time all because of machine learning um and I think this is like one of the key things about why this is such an interesting Innovation actually uh especially when you bring them over to crypto now in the real world like we already have lots of AI agents in fact you we we're using them all the time uh you have the likes of virtual assistants you know whether you're using Siri Alexa Google uh you have your chat agents I think many of you have been able to see some of these already especially um AI kind of text text prompting and things like that I think many of us have used them already uh we also have like robotic agents I think Tesla are really innovating on this there's also weo as well uh there's industry specific uh agents you have agents for regulating the the temperature in your home now you have agents that can help you write code whether it's co-pilot or code GPT um you have intellectual property kind of bringing characters to life through through agents you have health agents helping to diagnose and there's entertainment and and a whole range more really um so what can AI agents do in crypto well they can do all of the above and more and that's because of crypto's core principles the the idea of being transparent you know by being on a blockchain uh the ideas of tokenization liquidity funding speed and ownership that all that we all well aware of with with crypto rails the the this idea of permissionless access available to everyone 24/7 open source as well I think all of these are like at times very core components of why we believe in crypto and why we're here in crypto and AI agents can take advantage of all of this uh and make crypto a better place so right now agents are exploding in crypto I think everyone knows this uh I think if you're not if you're not aware of Agents exploding right now then you're definitely not in the right Market uh but I think yeah everyone is uh enjoying the agent meta um and I think there's like three main reasons why uh firstly you've got the idea of tokenization these agents can be tokenized and because they can be tokenized they have lots of speculation comp components to it now right now because it's new and Innovative and there are some cool things that you can do with them there's attenion so combine them together and you've got this crazy wave of speculation and right now there's a few different categories that we've seen of these AI Agents come to fruition uh I've put some of these down but we've got memes Frameworks platforms tooling and modules which I kind of count as individual specific agents um someone did actually uh I don't know who made this graphic exactly maybe it was these guys but um they did kind of write uh put this together a little bit of uh kind of some of the agents that we have available we're going to talk about some of these right now actually so what I'll do is I'll go through each of these categories and just briefly talk about some of the leaders uh maybe not even some of the lead just some of the ones that are interesting I will also cover some of the ones that I've that I've caught my attention to and uh we'll get an idea of what they are how they work and why they're interesting so let's start off with goat uh we'll start off actually with the meme category so we'll cover like um uh AI agents that are there purely for entertainment value or there for attention value um so we'll start off with goat uh so this is built by Andy who um basically created something called Infinite Back rooms they had these AI agents that that would all chat with one another one of them was uh truth terminal there's a lot of law behind its Inception and how it all came about but essentially tldr uh the the terminal itself uh here it is you can see it it tweets every single hour and uh it basically uh managed to first of all get a grant from a a16z uh a $50,000 Grant and uh it also kind of adopted this concept of goas Maximus and uh someone essentially made a pump fund token and the actual agent adopted it well the the actual terminal I I should say adopted it now you could argue that there isn't really that much connection between the terminal and the token uh but it's a pure meme it's an entertainment value play and I think because of that uh it's it was also one of the first and uh it did actually run up quite incredibly uh to over a billion dollars uh in market cap now today is trading a little bit lower valuation than that I believe it's like 500 or 600 million uh but it certainly has been a really interesting one and has been like the the first player um if we talk about AI agents anyway in crypto I should say uh we we have fcoin as well uh fcoin is a pure meme it's somehow connected to agents because of Tru terminal I think truth terminal mentioned it uh but again there isn't any specific link as such fcoin is really not an AI coin it's actually more of a meme coin but um some because of its lore and because of its uh Inception it gets classified in this category uh recently fcoin actually flipped goat and as of today I think fcoin is at alltime high uh very very interesting to see uh I think there's some sort of like f child or parent child relationship here um where goat is you know the parent vcoin is the child and you know goat is letting fcoin you know enjoy its success and go to go to new new heights but uh it's a funny one really um yeah I'm sure some of you have seen the meme you know hot air rises uh let's see if it continues to rise uh platforms now for me this is where agents get interesting uh I think yeah memes are great but there's like a limit to kind of how much uh function and real real world value they offer um yes other I mean talking about outside of speculation speculate all you want right uh no Financial advice but yeah platforms are the real game changer and I think these are uh some of the bigger bigger agent you know PL plays in in crypto today we have the likes of virtual spectral and a few others that we'll talk about so first of all starting with virtuals uh what is it it's essentially an AI La agent LaunchPad it's like the pump fun for AI agents um you can create uh you can create your own agent there they have their own framework as well that you can build with and you can build any sort of agent you want so we've got quite a few agents that have been built already I think actually now there's like hundreds and hundreds of these axt is one of the bigger ones uh there's Luna Sequoia a few others as well there are agents being launched from here all the time and virtuals has really cemented itself as being the platform for hosting these agents um here you can see some of them as well they have game Vader all kinds and um I think one of the interesting things that they have is that this token model where when you're launching or trading these agents they're paired with the virtual token and so if you want exposure to any of these and some of these have you know really bought out some really really interesting Concepts and Innovations people want exposure to them well you have to buy virtuals for for that so I think that's been a really interesting thing going for it uh and you can see the rise that it's had uh pretty much a 3 billion FTV now which is pretty remarkable uh given its rise in such a short period of time uh the spectral as well it's a VC backed AI protocol they have agents they're a platform that have agents that can do trading for you um so here you can see like a list of all of the different agents that people have created on there and these trading these agents actually trade on hyper liquid um they have all different kinds of strategies um and you can see like the agent um terminals like what the what the agents are actually doing um you can see even the p&l that some of these agents have made over time so quite kind of interesting spectral uh don't just do this spectral have a whole range of different agent products as well um I believe you can even launch your own agent coins and do all kinds of interesting stuff there but again this is like another platform uh very very heavily VC back with some of the big names in the space but another platform as well there's also Hollow World um this is a a platform for users to create agents that have 2D or 3D models again you can plug in your own data sources and train these models as you wish so you can you know create let's say um an agent that's trained on everything to know about Disney right you can you can create a Disney agent you can create all kinds of different agents they're entirely up to you uh they it's pretty straightforward and they have a nice like website and interface to kind of do all of this stuff but yeah here's like another platform for you to create your your own ageny and you can train them and do all kinds of interesting things with them uh there's VV Fu um which is another agent Launchpad again very similar you can kind of launch your own um agent coins or agent tokens and you know they'll have their own Twitter pages discords telegrams you can they can even have their own wallets you can trade them you can you can create them uh using different um Frameworks as well so you can use um we'll we'll talk about Frameworks in a in a moment but you can use all the different various Frameworks that that have been created as well there's my show my show are really really interesting I first caught eye of my show when they created a bit tenser subnet they also have raised a large amount of capital but they have this like Agent app store where you can find all kinds of different agents um or or AI kind of applications and use them uh you can even create your own and this is on BSC so yeah pretty interesting see if bance gets involved with that one a new one that I just saw as well was hold station I think they got a a big Grant from ZK sync uh creating uh again like another platform for users to launch their own a AI agents and again they can all do interesting things it's down to you if you want to kind of train it specifically and offer it uh some extra utility but this is like the platform itself so platforms have really had a lot of success I think most of it coming from um at the top with virtuals um and in general I think as we see more usage you know perhaps this will continue uh the most interesting um layer of AI agents at the moment for me is the the framework and this is because every single agent is built on these Frameworks there are quite a few different Frameworks right now you have ai 16z you have zerro with their own framework you have rig um you even have Mell as well um so I think there is called Alice um so the AI 16z framework is probably one of the biggest right now uh it's it's actually called the Aliza framework built by AI 16z what's really interesting is AI 16z really started off was like this meme coin SL investment Dow and now just kind of has created this framework called elizer and everyone's using it in fact you can go on GitHub right now and see the uh star you know the star history uh of basically how much this is being used this framework is being used a lot um and so it's rated it's reated from being a mcoin to being proper agent infra um in fact Shaw who's the founder um has been doing a really good job with this I found that he's actually been doing um education AI agent Dev school look at this one two 3 like pretty much every other day or every week um and you're getting thousands of people tuning into this as well uh both live and like watching these videos after people are building agents on these Frameworks and shorta is like doing a pretty good job with that yes there was some controversy before um but I think uh I think it's clear like the value prop that AI 16z offers um you can see it's basically you know the alliza framework this operating system for all AI agents you can go on there and kind of start working around building something using this framework and yeah again similar similar to virtuals although it hasn't reached that type of valuation just yet uh has had a remarkable Rise um over the weeks as people have realized you know how big this can actually become zerro as well this actually started off as an entertainment AI agent um and has its own AI entity um again they they have all kinds of products art generation meme Generation video generation uh all kinds of stuff they actually built out uh this album as well this this is AI generated music album and uh it's done it's gone pretty viral I think Dy loud even kind of mentioned it you know zerro one of the first virtual hip-hop rap artists driven by algorithms you know AI powered music um I think they've released a couple of albums but they also have a framework now and the framework is uh also being used massively as people are building things on top of it and again similar to a6c massive runup uh you know really showing itself as being one of the big ones as well we have um rig which is um a rust based framework that token is Arc um again this is a one that's built on Rust so really for those who are familiar with the salana ecosystem uh you can again use this framework to build any sort of agent that you want as well as I mentioned some of these platforms that we talked about in the previous slide are introducing these different Frameworks so that you can decide what sort of agent framework you want to use you can pick and choose and uh if you want to use rig you can if you want to use zbros you can if you want to use uh Eliza from ai6 Z you can do so it's entirely up to you um so yeah the Frameworks are are pretty big because I think ultimately they are like the base layer I like to think of the Frameworks as like the layer ones of AI agents um so you have ai 16z you have you know some of these other agents as um some of these other agent Frameworks they're all like different layer ones they have their pros and cons but usually there's one big one and right now that is AI 16z but of course this space is so uh new I think things are changing so rapidly that you know don't be surprised if something does change we'll talk about individual agents now and I think these are some of the things that you see more often from a front-facing perspective these are kind of like the apps on the layer one itself so we'll start off with axt this is built on virtuals framework um and so this is a virtual agent so that's why you saw um AI xpt on the virtual platform now ai xpt is essentially a crypto content creator it's trained on a bunch of crypto content creators um it covers all sectors of untrained crypto and just crypto in general D5 products you know upcoming launches um and it pretty much has the highest mind of every single person in crypto today this AI agent is the best K ever why because it can tweet 24 hours a day uh and it's trained on pretty much every single not every single but it's trained on a lot of top creators as well in fact um you know you can see here from some of these tweets you know it's trained on you know someone's someone's clearly given it some data on grass grass being one of the AI tokens that has performed really well and it's you know it's TW in like a content creator word giving lots of educational value um I you know wrote a tweet about ivlp and I noticed a couple hours later AI xpt kind of basically took some part of my tweets and uh WR us read about it and obviously these tweets are performing much better than some of my tweets are doing so yeah axt is better than me uh it's getting more mind than me it's got more followers than me um I really wonder if we're in this age where AI agents are going to take over maybe I'll have to convert my Twitter page into AI agent page as well we'll have to wait and see but um yeah AI xbt as you can see with a lot of these other tokens uh it's pretty much at alltime high price um right now uh here's one that's a lot smaller and I will say that I do own this token as well so please take that in mind no Financial advice but this one's called Talis um and I think what's really interesting is that it's bringing defi to AI agents through onchain agent actions um what's really interesting is sha the founder of AI 16z uh actually created this token he created Talis but he kind of left it for the community and uh the redacted research team did a CTO of this uh and basically took it over so it's built on the Aliza framework and what the the redacted research team have been able to do over the last few weeks has been pretty remarkable they've integrated it with a few different protocols including lit protocol to try and give Talis you know a trusted execution environment wallet uh using so tees with that security they're going to be using Omar protocol one of the pretty interesting novel a agent coordination uh protocols uh using their te using their Tex tack to kind of give this agent functionality across different yield generating uh platforms on chain and they use Shogun for intent-based uh you know um intent based execution so cross-chain swaps cross chain bridging Etc um and so by using these different Tech Stacks the tius agent is able to basically have its own wallet go on chain start doing transactions whether it's trading whether it's yield farming whether it's earning yield on its assets all by itself independently um and you might be thinking like where does it get this information from well it's plugged into various different data sources you know one of them is called cookies AI I think it's one of the best ones around at the moment really trying to learn about everything that it can uh and remember what I said at the start these agents learn and get better and get better own and get better and that's exactly what we're seeing here so yeah I think this is a really interesting one uh a couple of days ago uh they actually announced that um Talis will be integrated with story protocol to basically offer IP integration and this is this is really really interesting because I think this will be like one of the first uh tokenized agents that have uh IP where it can monetize this sell its tokenized IP um and you know make money from it as well so yeah I think that's really wild and yeah I I did say that I did do hold this one um and I do think that this one's a very very interesting one and it's uh yeah been trading pretty well recently as well there are many many other agent modules um we have lowkey which is like an AI agent terminal for onchain Alpha they released something today with a terminal where you need to hold to access so if you hold uh a certain number of Loki tokens uh you will be able to access its agent terminal and there you'll be able to speak directly with this agent and get kind of the information that the agent has directly benefit from it uh there's something called beats AI I saw this the other day as well it's based on hyper liquid it's an AI agent that produces music there's Nikita which is on Bas it's like an information kol baked AI agent there's bully which is like this agent that basically replies to people on CT just hating on them uh there's there's hack which is an AI agent that's used for auditing smart contract it's basically uh a white a white hat hacker um yeah loads and loads of these are coming to the the market in fact every single day there's probably something new coming to the market uh and yeah I think this is why that this space is so interesting right now you also have tooling agents uh you could kind of count this as infra I guess as well so one of them is called fxn they have uh talked about this concept called swarms which are these agent to agent interactions uh where kind of you know with with these um with these agents they can't really talk to one another because there's some level of fragmentation right if there's an agent that's built on a frame like a6c it's not going to work with the game framework or the zerro framework or the myow framework they're not really going to be able to kind of support each other talk to each other help each other those different agents but when you're using swarms uh they actually help to improve the efficiency and share resources between these different Agents from different Frameworks and different networks so fxn is a really really interesting one you know they they're shipping like crazy so we're seeing like new sdks and new support for different things being added every single week so this is a really really interesting one to me there's also cookies AI they I I mentioned this before but they are like H have everything that you need to track AI agent tokens whether it's m chair Impressions engagement um what's happening in the AI agent space metrics like total market cap all kinds of stuff really really good to see and you can see like right now as we're talking fcoin has the number one wi chair air xpt does Griffin we didn't mention this but this based on salana offering onchain actions uh through its agent very very interesting of course we mentioned ai6 Z goat virtuals I think we mentioned a lot of these Well story protocol I did just mention this when talking about Talis but um yeah agent to agent interactions You could argue that this is a a competitor to fxn um but really just going to show like how agents can uh engage with one another and I think they're going to be building lots of this as well so yeah I think overall the agent space is very novel I mean it's only been around for a couple of months um and we're seeing so much happen in just such a short period of time every single day there's something new now if you add up all of the total market cap of AI agents today uh we're talking about 10 billion uh FTV or market cap is pretty much mostly circulating so you can see this all here like virtuals is pretty much the the the big one there uh and then you've got fcoin you know goat ai6 Z you know cerebra Griffin a xbt a few of these others as well um but all of that 10 billion now if you add in like the other agent protocols the likes of um uh fet ji which is called something else it's called ASI now uh the likes of spectral autolus um other VC backed protocols we can add in another 10 billion FTV right now and so add that together total AI agent space today is uh 20 billion this actually overestimated a little bit lower than that right now uh but the total crypto market cap is 3.8 trillion it's really really interesting just seeing like how small AI agents are if you look at like the overall crypto Market cap now one question that I think lots of people have been asking are AI agents the new version of Def summer I think there's definitely some similarities and I believe that they probably are defi total market cap today is 140 billion and it peaked at 170 billion last cycle with 6.7% dominance of all of crypto now just to compare and find out like where we are this cycle with AI agents um AI agents today are 5% of the total crypto market cap which means we're basically 10 10 x off where defi topped off last cycle 10x off and if we look at like um that that's based on like total dominance right if we look at like the actual uh D5 market cap I mean if we look at today 140 billion uh and we're at 20 billion we're 7x off so there's still many many X's to play if we're going to be kind of where defi is today um what's really interesting however is if you look at M share AI is by far the only big thing in crypto that's getting massive attention right now and uh you could you could argue like earlier this year we had the mem coin super cycle maybe that's still going to play out but if you look at like the Mind share that AI has right now even if you combine memes defi gamei stable coins ETFs l2s and kind of all together it's not even what AI is right now and you might be thinking oh yeah W right AI isn't just AI agents there so many other components of AI as well well have a look at this as of a few um few days ago this is kind of how the AI sector M share was looking here's an agent here's an agent here's an agent here's an agent agent agent agent agent agent agent agent agent agent you've got just a few here that are non- agent protocols you know the likes of to Nia grass ironette render nilon which hasn't launched yet it's token anyway but all of these actually complement AI agents in varying ways you know there are AI agent stuff on subnets happening on tow uh a lot of the AI agents will need compute um you know to train any llm you need data where does that data come from from grass all right if you uh if you want to train the best AI agents you need personal data what are you going to use for that of course you're going to use illion so all of these AI Protocols are actually kind of part of AI agents but it didn't but you know they're kind of separate what I'm trying to say is the vast majority of M share right now in crypto is all to do with AI agents but if you actually look AI agents are only 05% of the total crypto market cap so I think there's some disparity there and that's why I think this number is generally going to go up over time um so yeah the last question that I'll leave it at today is what should AI agents be valued at by you know as a category 100 billion that's still less than defi is today it's a 5x from here the overall overall kind of category 200 billion that's a 10x from here 500 billion that's a 50x from here um I think either way if we're going to see the AI agent space uh you know continue as it is right now then I think that M share will convert into an increase in valuation and that's why I think 100 billion for AI agents is fairly reasonable that's a 5x from here and that means that for you guys you probably will hit some 5 10 20 50 x's on some of your coins um no fin advice I could be completely wrong but this is kind of how I'm seeing things right now with the agent space so yeah I think we'll leave at that let me know what your thoughts are about the AI agent space I think AI agents are probably going to command a pretty big size in fact AI as a whole commands a pretty big size of my portfolio today probably will continue to do so for the rest of the cycle um but I'm very intrigued to hear like what your thoughts are about the entire AI cycle um what coins do you like what coins do you not like any specific sector that you want to double down on you know there's this
