Description:
Okay, here's a comprehensive summary of the provided content in English, focusing on key points and maintaining the original context:

**Summary:**

This video is a guide for experienced software developers on how to capitalize on the current AI boom and monetize their skills. The speaker, who himself transitioned into a "multi-figure AI empire" in under two years without a formal computer science background, shares a roadmap based on his experience and surveys of top performing developers in his 40,000-strong community. He emphasizes that AI is now more accessible than ever and that developers are ideally positioned to take advantage of the opportunity, requiring only a few weeks of focused learning to start earning from the AI market.

**Key Points:**

*   **The AI Opportunity:** The AI market is projected to grow 20 times by 2030, making it the ideal "boat" to be in for developers. It's not just for seasoned experts; the tools and pre-trained models now available make AI development accessible to anyone.
*   **Three Paths:** The video outlines three distinct paths for developers entering the AI space:
    *   **The 9-to-5 AI Developer:** Focuses on securing high-paying and innovative AI-focused roles within traditional companies.
    *   **The AI Freelancer:** Emphasizes flexibility, freedom, and working on your own terms, leveraging the high demand for AI talent.
    *   **The AI Founder:** Aimed at developers who wish to build their own AI startups, either by partnering with entrepreneurs or launching an AI automation agency.
*   **Roadmap:** The guide breaks down a four-step process for each path:
    1.  **Choose Your Path:** Based on your values (stability, freedom, or ownership).
    2.  **Learn:** Focus on core AI skills such as:
        *   **Prompt Engineering:** Mastering the art of using natural language prompts to achieve complex tasks.
        *   **No-Code and Low-Code Tools:** Embracing platforms for rapid prototyping and building core functionality quickly.
        *   **Advanced AI Libraries:** Learning tools like Langchain and Llama Index for more tailored solutions.
        *   **Community:** Engaging with other AI developers to accelerate learning.
    3.  **Apply:** Start building real-world experience by engaging in online communities, offering value upfront, and taking on projects, even if unpaid initially.
    4.  **Monetize:** Each path has a unique strategy:
        *   **9-to-5:**  Create a personal website, pitch your skills internally, apply to external roles, and network with AI startups.
        *   **Freelancer:**  Build an online presence, seek clients from online communities, create content, and offer consulting services.
        *   **Founder:** Build a strong portfolio, find partners in online communities, share value consistently, and vet partnerships carefully.
*   **Accessibility:** The speaker emphasizes that developers already have a strong foundation and can transition into AI with relatively short focused learning periods.
*   **Emphasis on Community:** The importance of joining communities for learning, networking and finding opportunities is repeatedly emphasized.  The speaker's own community is highlighted as a particularly valuable resource.
*  **Real-World Examples:** The speaker includes stories of individuals within his community (Teu, Tara, and Will) who have successfully transitioned into AI roles through these steps.
* **Importance of Action:** The final message emphasizes the need to take action and start using these strategies.

**In essence, the video aims to empower software developers with a structured, actionable guide for breaking into the AI space and building successful careers or businesses by using the tools and resources they already possess.** It's a call to action to recognize the opportunity, learn the key skills and start applying those skills within AI communities.

I turned myself Tau development skill set into a multi- figure AI Empire in under two years from building an AI development company to launching an AI SAS and even AI Consulting Services as well I've done it all and the truth is that I'm not actually the most experienced developer I have no degree I've got no formal experience in a development role but over the past 2 years I've figured out the best ways to monetize my skills in the AI age and if I can do it so can you especially if you're already an experienced developer as well I've surve the top performing developers across my 40,000 strong community and uncovered what they wish they had known before diving into Ai and I've distilled those lessons to three proven paths that will help you to sidestep the most common pitfalls and really just fast trck your AI success so whether you're looking for a higher paying job or for more freedom as a freelancer or you want to start your own AI business then this road map will show you exactly how to do it using those three paths and make sure you stick around until the end because I give you access to my most comprehensive set of resources ever complete with training videos step-by-step instructions in order to help you take action on everything that you got to learn today now if you're interested in using the AI boom to get more out of your life and career as a developer let me share a little bit about my journey because I think it shows what's possible for anyone if you have the right road map so my journey as a developer is a pretty humble one compared to many of you probably watching this video uh in about 2022 I started teaching myself how to code mainly through udemy courses starting with just python Basics then moving into machine learning with python and eventually exploring goang and JavaScript and by the end of 2022 I began experimenting with language models like ber for sentiment analysis tasks that I was really interested in and that was just before chat gbt launched and so that was really the turning point for me I started jumping into the open AI apis I created this channel to share what I was building and within 7 months I was hitting 100,000 subscribers now nearly 2 years into my AI Journey I'm at over 260,000 subscribers and I've experimented with dozens of ways to monetize my AI skills and so today I'm sharing the methods that have worked best for me and for the thousand of developers I surveyed in my free community to make this video possible before we jump into the three main paths that developers are using to transition into AI let's make it clear why AI is the best vehicle right now for you to get more out of your life and your career as a developer the AI Market is expected to grow to 20 times its current size by 2030 hitting nearly $2 trillion in total value and as Warren Buffett says it's not about how hard you row it's about the boat that you're run and right now ai is the boat to be in there's developers who are getting into Ai and are really riding this wave to higher paying jobs exciting projects at work and new business ventures and startups as well but the thing is that you don't need years of training to get into AI anymore there's tools like open AI pre-trained models and no code platforms yes I didn't like them either but we'll talk about them a little bit later you've got things like make.com and even these non- techies non-developers are getting into Ai and they're getting paid for it as well a good example is my a member for my community will um he's a member of my accelerator and he landed a job for $250,000 per year at an AI voice St startup called thle and his title was Chief Solutions engineer will isn't a developer he's never learned to code he built all of his skills using only the tools that are now available while many developers with actual development skill sets are still sitting and watching this AI boom from the sidelines and if that annoys you it should cuz AI is our Arena this is a software Revolution and While others are getting their piece of the pie you're perfectly positioned to get yours too and so my point here is that AI is more accessible than ever and any EXP exped developer is just a few weeks of focused learning away from being able to start capitalizing on this moment in time and getting ahead of the curve and that's what this video is really here to do for you is to show you how to use this road map to take advantage of the opportunity and monetize your skills as a developer as effectively as possible just like myself and thousands of other people in the community have done as well so if you're ready to use this moment to earn more to work on more exciting projects or even have more freedom in your career the first step is pretty clear and that's to decide which path into AI you want to take each of the three paths we're going to cover leverages your existing skills differently whether you're looking for stability flexibility or the chance to build something from scratch so let's break down each of the paths and what they look like so you can decide on which one aligns with what you're after from your life and your career but I want you to think about what you value most right now in your life is it stability is it Freedom or is it building something of your own the first path people are using to get into AI is what we can call the ninto F and this is if you prefer the stability or comfort of a tradition traditional job but want better pay or you want to work on more exciting things at work then this 9 to5 of a rout could be the perfect fit for you you don't need a launch a new startup you don't need to completely reinvent yourself to take advantage of this AI boom it's just a few strategic moves that can be used to basically boost your income put you onto more Innovative projects and make you stand out in your company overall I mean it's no secret these days that AI focused roles in the development world are paying significantly more these days you've got entry-level AI engineers at top companies starting around 224,000 with senor olds going up to more than a million dollars in comp Plus stocks and bonuses Etc so not only does the AI development skill set make you a much more desirable higher for the foreseeable future you also get to do what deep down I think most developers really want to do and that's to solve real problems at least that's what attracted me to the field and generative AI is a is a new frontier of innovation and it's completely reshaping certain industries and and business processes and so by transitioning into AI within this 9 to5 role you get to earn more while working on groundbreaking technology that's actively changing the world rather than working on probably some of the mundane projects that you've you've had at work that You' rather you'd wish you weren't really working on but you had to do anyway so if you want to stay within the traditional framework of a developer role but also maximize your Awards in life and career then this 9 to-5 path is for you so the overall goal for the 9to F path is to get a higher paying and more exciting role in the AI space and so keep that in mind because for all of the goals that I'm going to cover here that's going to take us into the next part of this video where we're going to break down the steps to get to those goals and to monetize your skills eventually getting against number two we have the second path which is the freelancer the freelancer path is for people who value freedom and flexibility more than a traditional office job and they want to control their own projects their own schedule and ultimately control their own lifestyle so if that sounds like you then the AI freelancer path is ideal right now demand for AI developers is through the roof my own AI automation agency has received thousands of project requests over the past 18 months alone through this Channel and if you want more proof of this surging demand for AI development talent and services in my free community of the 356 recent posts in my hiring or for a higher channel 61% of those recent posts were from businesses or individuals who are actively looking to hire AI development Talent this kind of demand for AI development services within online communities is a particularly important part of the strategies that we're going to cover later in this video so keep that in mind but beyond just development services freelancing isn't just about taking on Project work you can also SE your own rates and build multiple sources of income like doing consulting or doing coaching as well there Developers like teu and Tara who are development coaches in my accelerator program and they both left their jobs and started as Freelancers going through sort of online communities Etc and now found their Lane of coaching others building both income and reputation in the space so of high paying flexible work from a dreamy location like barley or Thailand or the Caribbean without the 95 structure appeals to you then this freelancer route is for you the overarching goal for the freelancer path is to make enough money to put your job and then work for yourself from anywhere in the world then getting into our third and final path we have what we can call the founder this is the path for developers who want more than just a job or a contract for a client they want to be able to build something of their own and I think secretly a large chunk of the developer Community secretly is longing to ditch their 9 to5 ditch their job and launch their own startup to bring new products into the world like solving real problems and creating a product around it and so if you're entrepreneurial like this now is the perfect time to consider making that jump and becoming a Founder because AI is really attracting everyone to it right now meaning that you have thousands of expert business people and Market with multi-million dollar ideas and the means to Market those ideas effectively who are desperately searching for technical Partners to bring their product ideas to life so there are literally hundreds of people joining my free community every single day hundreds and many of these people are actively looking for development Partners to pair up with and co-found startups and like I said 61% of the recent posts in my hiring and for high channel in my community were from businesses or individuals who are actively looking to hire development Talent there's a large chunk of those people who are also looking for co-founders devel velopment Partners to join them in a business so what I'm saying is that there's never been a better time to pair up with entrepreneurs who want to do all the stuff that you don't want to do as a developer so they do with the marketing and sales you get to just focus on building an incredible product which I think is what the majority of developers want out of being a founder and creating a startup and so while the the typical build and AI startup route does have its appeal there's a faster way to get into AI business which is through What's called the AI automation agency model so you can think of this as a modern version of a web development agency but specifically for building AI system systems of businesses it's really a great entry point and exposes you to the best use cases for AI in the world right now that can be spun into their own AI SAS products which given your experience as a developer that transition from finding a a product or solution that you built for a client into its own AI SAS product is going to be much easier than for these non- techies who are also getting into it so you have an advantage there of being able to transition from a solution for one client into as SS product for example I started my own AI automation agency Morningside AI because I've always been more interested in building the business than strictly developing and being on the keys all the time the AI automation agency model lets you start quite small with minimal startup Capital just a$ few hundred really especially as a developer and this helps you to avoid the painfully long VC funding route you can just start a business quite quickly start to generate cash flow leave your job if that's what you want to do and eventually scale into larger Ventures like the AI SAS plays I've just mentioned so with the revenue and experience that I gain from running Morningside AI I launched my own AI s agentive which now has over 28,000 users on it if launching startup and creating awesome new products is your goal the founder path is built for you so the overarching goal for the founder is to partner with an entrepreneur or marketer who has a validated idea ideally the connections and the sales expertise needed to take this to Market but they lack the technical expertise and need a partner to build it with so choosing your path really comes down to what you want most right now in your life and career whether that's stability with high pay and interesting things to work on as 9-to-5 AI developer or the freedom to set your own schedule and choose your client as a freelancer or purpose in building something of your own as a founder and it's important to note that these paths aren't mutually exclusive freelancing can easily lead into founding your own business down the line but you need to start with one that fits with your current goals and also your lifestyle constraints as well if you've got a family or you've got other commitments Etc you need to pick one that works for your goals and also the constraints you have and at the end of this video I'm going to be sharing the resources and the road map with real case studies from community members that I've surveyed so that you can see what's possible with each of these paths if you can't quite make up your mind now so that's all in the end with the roap that I'm going to give to you step two of the road map is called the learn phase and so once you've chosen your path it's time to level up with the right skills to get into the AI space and I think a lot of developers really overthink this but learning AI is a lot simpler than it looks and as a developer you really already have the foundational knowledge to excel an AI it's just a case of adding the right skills on top of what you already know what surprised me most when I was upscaling in AI was how simple many of the AI programs are compared to some of their traditional equivalents because the the models are doing so much of the heavy lifting in these programs your programs end up being so much more Compact and short and for me with a 8mon long self-taught development skill set this was a Gods end cuz I could just build way cooler stuff and way more complex programs by doing less work which was was really the most awesome part about getting into AI development for me and in my own development Journey what you end up noticing is that it's often just about crafting a well-written prompt or set of prompts and then connecting these tools or prompts in a way that accomplishes pretty complex tasks really efficiently based on my own experience and the insights from the top developers I surveyed in my community in this section we're going to go over the core areas that you need to focus on upskilling in but you're going to find a full list of resources in the road map guide that I'm going to provide at the end of this video so the first thing of course that you're going to need to upskill in is prompt engineering and mastering prompts is really the foundation of the AI technology that we work with these days and it's incredibly powerful rather than having to write these big long functions to process data like you typically would have to you can now just craft a a well-written set of words into a prompt that's going to transform that input data into output data As You Wish basically instantly there Andre Kathy famous said the hottest new programming language is English and in a sense prompt engineering is exactly that your coding in natural language you can achieve the same things that you could with a big function with just an API call with a carefully written prompt and so with the right prompt engineering techniques you can reliably transform large amounts of data and get the results you need at scale so you can create functions based around these natural language prompts that can do things for businesses T typically businesses at scale and of course nowadays everyone thinks they know prompt engineering cuz they've played around with chat GPT but mastering it for business applications which is typically where you're going to be creating the most value requires a lot more precision and I've included the best resources to quickly Master this in the road map we're going to cover at the end prompt engineering really is modern day magic so you do need to take it quite seriously the next area that you'll need to upskill in is with no Code and low code tools now I know I felt the exact same way when I first got into the AI space but before you completely dismiss these no code tools you need to let me explain for two seconds right so I used to think that these noode platforms like voice flow and zap here were just a way of like people who couldn't code coping and like a inferior accepting that it's some inferior platform uh I can't code but I can use this instead which kind of gets me halfway there kind of like a a compromise basically but as my AI automation agency morning side AI grew I realized these platforms have come quite a long way from what I thought they were and they're actually excellent for prototyping and building out core functionality very quickly and them custom coded features can be added for more advanced things as needed what you'll quickly realize is most of the work that you'll do in the AI base initially will be around proof of concept or minimum viable products MVPs just to test and validate that these AI systems are actually one they work and two that they're actually valuable then building on no code and lowo platforms here is completely logical and it literally saves you days of effort and costs however once a system is validated and ready to scale then it's worth transitioning to a fully custom build which is where you can provide a lot more value as a developer with these skills needed to do so this open-mindedness towards low code and no code tools is so important for developers who are moving into AI it's literally one of the most common bits of advice given from people who have successfully transitioned that I surveyed in my community to make this video you essentially have to swallow your pride a little bit and be more pragmatic about how you approach these projects it's more so about building quickly and building reliable systems in a cost effective manner than your own personal opinions and feelings towards these platforms and of course I've included all of the resources that you'll need to learn these platforms quickly in the road map I'll give you at the end of this video the next thing you need to learn is what we can call Advanced tools so once you've got the basics prompt engineering in nood and lood tools you can dive into advanced libraries like Lang chain or llama index and learn to build with Vector databases this is where you can really leverage your development skills to tackle larger and more complex projects because unlike the newbies who don't have any development background you'll be able to understand the power and flexibility that these libraries offer and use this to deliver Advanced and really tailored solutions to clients who need more than just the kind of off the shelf applications that you can build with a lot of these no Code and low code tools so this is really where you get to show your strength you understand understand the prompt engineering and low code Foundation but on top of it you can provide the customization and extensibility that ultimately a lot of businesses need so you really can just have the best of both worlds as a developer who has really been open-minded to master both the custom coded aspect of it and also the no code and loow code side and finally the last part of this learning phase is going to be Community surrounding yourself with other AI focused developers is one of the fastest ways that you can pick up new skills and stay up to date on where the current Tech is moving having a place that you can ask questions to more experienced AI Developers can literally save you days of trouble particularly with certain kinds of builds so getting around a community of other AI developers is a no-brainer step for you in your road map I've created a list of the best developer focused AI communities that you can join and they'll all be included in the road map guide with this video and realistically this learning phase that we've just gone through is going to take you about 2 months or so before you're ready to move on to the real world application in The Next Step but the goal here in this learning phase is simple you need to get skilled you need to get comfortable with the technology and you need to prepare to apply what you've learned learn in the real world so to make this easy I've organized all of the top rated resources to upskill an AI from the developers that I surveyed and even from our own experience into one single guide which you can follow step by step to rapidly move through this learning phase which will be included with the road map at the end of this video step three in your road map is what we can call the apply phase so once you've built up your skills The Next Step you need to take is to get some real world experience with those skills and the best way to do that is to start by helping people who actually need AI Solutions right now and so many early stage AI entrepreneurs and AI automation agency owners business owners Etc are eager to integrate AI into their business or build products but they lack the technical skills to do so and this of course is where you come in so the best place to find these kinds of opportunities where people are looking for these skills is in online communities where you're getting AI enthusiasts and professionals all gathering together and so my free school Community is the largest AI community on school with over 40,000 members that includes developers business owners even investors just everyone who's been drawn into this AI opportunity is coming through that Community every day there's hundreds of new people coming in from my videos and from elsewhere and they're posting in channels and the in their hiring tab or development discussions looking for help looking for advice the opportunities here are nearly endless especially if you're willing to provide some value up front before asking for something right so here's how you can start applying your skills in these communities you can start with my school group that's going to be linked in the first link in the description it's a hub of people excited about Ai and Entrepreneurship and business and Tech and many people are actively looking for help advice and technical support which you can help them out with next you need to set up your profile within that Community to make it clear that you're an AI developer and you're ready to help so this is a small change but it can do a world of difference of people who are coming into these communities it's just to correctly position yourself and being proud of what you've done or of your skill set I know it's it's a common developer thing to want to be like fairly humble or I'm not qualified to do this I need to go and sit some Masters in AI you need to drop that and you need to leave it at the door now is not the time to be shy this is one of again one of the most important things that came through in the survey that I did is that you need to be willing to put yourself out there and be proud of your skills and the value you bring to the table you don't need to have a master's degree or a PhD in AI to say that you're an AI developer these days the technology is so new you can within the space of a couple of months come up and be literally one of the top 0.1% of the people who are using say AI voice agent technology the space is moving so fast now the experts are really just the ones who are keeping up in your profile you can stand out by listing the skills you have expressing your interest in contributing to the community and by this way people can see at a glance you bring to the table when you're interacting within the community then the next step is to offer some free value up front don't wait for paid gigs right now you can just answer questions you can make posts you can explain complex AI Concepts in simple terms or share tutorials on setting up useful AI systems many of the developers in my community have got hundreds and hundreds of comments and connections through their post just by sharing some helpful and valuable insights and helpful content and I've put a couple of examples of this on the road maps you can see just exactly the kinds of posts you can make and just get tons and tons of Engagement and interest in your services and become a little bit of a celebrity within the community really and then finally you just need to start taking on some real projects so by providing free help to people in the community you'll find plenty of chances to dive into actual projects with them and so don't worry about the money at this stage you need to focus on gaining the experience and building some credibility up improving your skills and the paid work will come but right now it's more important to build a solid foundation and applying those skills in the real world and getting experience and a great example of this is again teu one of my coaches and my accelerator and so he joined my free community last year and started offering free advice and very quickly got recognized in the community as a go-to AI developer for anything that they needed from there my team quickly noticed him and hired him as a freelance development coach with my accelerator for our members and then he's also gone on to start his own AI automation agency with another coach of M neck or you can take Tara as another example who's another one of my coaches and my accelerator she started off her AI Journey just jumping in as a developer into my free school Community she just doen started helping out wherever she could and quickly caught the attention of not only myself my team but everyone in the community as well Tara's background was in Consulting at the L but she was able to leave that job begin traveling Asia start working freelance as a coach and a consultant with the level of flexibility and freedom that she'd always wanted and now she's actually leading the setup of our Enterprise Consulting division for my own company morning side AI here in New Zealand and fun fact she's even staying here in my house with me while she's here so the stories of people like my coaches shows just how far you can go just by getting into one of these communities and giving out free value and being noticed by the right people these are just some of the examples of people who have come into these communities given their development knowhow and just freely given I give you these examples just to show you how quickly things can change for you and just how in demand developers who can properly position themselves in the space art if you go into a community like my own again you can do it in other places as well but I know best what is happening within my community so I can tell you that it's a really good place to do it because I've seen it firsthand but developers who come into these kinds of communities and position them themselves well and start giving a ton of free value they get picked up immediately by the right people and they go on to bigger and better things and so realistically for this whole apply phase where you're putting your skills into action in the real world if you stay consistent it will take about 2 months to build the experience that you need to move on the next stage which brings us to step four which is monetizing your skills and experience so obviously each of the different paths we've covered is trying to achieve quite different things here I've created a detailed road map for each of these different paths based off the surveys and my own experience there's actually too much information on each of these different paths to go through in this video alone so I'm just going to be running through the most important steps for each now but you can dive deeper into all the resources that I've Linked In the road map that I'm going to provide at the end so starting off with the monetization strap for the 9to F path and remember the goal here is to get a higher paying and more exciting role in the AI space so the first step is to set up a personal brand website this is just creating a website that's going to allow you to showcase the AI projects and portfolio from the work that you did in the apply phase and that allows you to highlight your your experience and the skills and your background pre AI as well so this is your online resumé and a place to demonstrate your work and experience and I've actually provided a ton of examples of these kind of personal brand sites in the road map which you can use for inspiration secondly you need to pitch your skills internally at your company so if you're already a developer in a developer role start discussing potential AI initiatives with your own company with your manager you can talk to your boss about AI project ideas you could help them Implement and this positions you as the go-to AI expert and really helps them to see the potential of having maybe an AI Department led by you down the line what you need to understand is that most businesses are interested in getting this technology integrated but they just don't know where to start and if you can give them kind of Be The Guiding Light towards that you are putting yourself right in the pathway for Rapid career progression to be this person who can lead the company through the transition next if your current company doesn't have any internal AI opportunities for you then start applying to external roles that align with the goals and what you're looking to get out of the space many of these AI developer positions are paying anywhere from $200 to $300,000 annually for skill developers and I've included key resources in the road map to help you streamline your job search and and applications actually using AI in many cases and then finally what I think is the smartest route for people in this 9 to-5 path is to play a bit of 4D chess with the AI jobs market and instead of joining the queue of traditional applicants and thousands of people trying to get into AI right now you can actually get noticed by AI startups directly through their own communities so for example will you remember him from earlier in the video member of my accelerator who again has no coding experience but he was very active and thly the AI voice startups community and was eventually offered a $250,000 per year role as a chief Solutions engineer despite not being an engineer so during this learn and apply phases that we've gone through before make sure you're keeping an eye out for AI startups that you're interested in or you like what they're doing and engage with them directly because in most cases these AI startups have investor money to spend on top talent they just need to notice you like they're ready to hire just make yourself visible to them now getting into the monetization strategy for the freelancer path and remember the goal here is to make enough money to qu your job and work for yourself from anywhere in the world that you want so first step similar to the 9 to5 route is to set up a personal brand site you're going to be creating a website showcasing your AI project portfolio from the stuff that you built in the apply phase over the previous two months including testimonials from clients that you work with and putting on your website a clear open for work status this is going to establish your credibility and make it easy for clients to learn more about you in the past things you've done and again I've provided examples of these kinds of sites on the road map next you want to focus on getting clients from online community so you need to choose one or two high quality communities that are on a good growth trajectory and ideally they're backed by a consistent leader or team like my own where we are actively trying to grow it and bring more people into it picking the right Community is particularly important because you're going to be putting quite a lot of effort in building a reputation up and being noticed in this community and if you have picked the right boat it will sort of sail and take you to where you want to go in terms of new clients and consistently adding new people in there that you can start to work with so as soon as you're in one of these communities that you've highlighted mean I can only recommend my own because I know how good it is in there but you need to focus on being active within that community on a daily basis you need to make sure that your profile includes your personal brand side and clearly states your expertise as an AI developer and as I said this isn't the time to be humble you need to own it you need to get in there and offer help you need to share insights you need to provide value and again I've provided some examples in the road map of the most effective ways that I've seen within my community to put out some value and get a ton of Engagement back it's consistent engagement in communities like these that can lead to a steady flow of projects for you as an Freelancers so once you've got the solid reputation in the community it's really just straightforward to offer your services for a fee on this call they've already seen what you know they've seen how much engagement you're poos to getting you have all the authority and positioning you need to start taking on these projects thirdly once you've got the ball rolling in the community you can start creating content as well so this is going to bring even more work to you by regularly crossposting your project Works your tips and tricks and insights from what you're already doing on school and put it on different platforms like LinkedIn or YouTube and this is going to attract potential clients organically posting on these platforms allows more people to discover you and when done consistently can bring you in more project deal flow and income than you could ever really imagine like for me when I started this YouTube channel it was just a an inflection point for my entire career despite doing business for years before that and finally if you're interested in a secondary source of income aside from just AI development services as a freelancer you can offer Consulting Services as well and this is what I did early on in my AI journey and within a few months I was making $4,300 per month initially doing just $300 calls but eventually that got up to $997 for 45 minutes and yes people were still buying them at that price by far the easiest way to do this and set up this Consulting coaching is to create a booking link and put it on your profile on your main platforms like school or or LinkedIn and you can set up one of these easy booking links with Ken Lee and their stripe integration so that you can take payments this lets clients book in one-on-one sessions with you for a fee providing you with yet another income stream that can help to diversify away from just uh freelancing projects and finally we have the monetization strategy for the founder path and reminder that the goal here is to partner up with an entrepreneur or a marketer who has a validated idea and they have the connections and the skills to sell it but they just need the technical partner to be able to build it with them the first step in this strategy like the others is to create a personal brand site and portfolio showcasing the recent experience from your apply and learn phases that makes you a more attractive technical partner for entrepreneurs and marketers who are looking for a co-founder with proven skills and experience so by positioning and branding yourself correctly you will attract the best of the best co-founders secondly just like the freelancer route you need to join some top online AI communities that are attracting your ideal kind of co-founders like my free school as I said my community literally has hundreds of people coming in every single day uh and these are marketers entrepreneurs business owners Etc who are looking for people like you so there is no doubt in my mind that you can't find just one then once you're inside the community you need to introduce yourself and share what you're looking for I've got some examples that I'm going to provide on the road map as well on how to do a proper introduction to get the most attention possible thirdly you need to stay active just like with the Freelancers sharing value here is extremely effective at attracting hundreds of people to your honey poop right you're trying to Market yourself you're trying to bring the best people towards you you want to take your pick from the best of the best that come into this community you want the best co-founder possible so you need to be willing to invest some time and energy in providing free value before you expect to get something back other things you can do is join calls like my weekly Q&A so that you can start to hear people and hear ideas and see people on the calls and start to make connections and reach out to people you can even host your own events and in general just be proactive about reaching out to potential Partners there's hundreds of people coming in every day so if you just check every day to look for these new opportunities new introduction posts and yourself post once or twice a week to attract potential co-founders there is no way that if you do this consistently for two months you won't have found at least a couple high quality partners that you can move forward with and so your final step in this founder route is to vet the Partnerships carefully when you find a potential partner don't commit right away instead you should propose a short trial period to work together something like 3 months to test the partnership where you say let's build an MVP together you want to ease into this and give it enough time that you get to see the best and worst sides of them and So eventually you can set up a revenue sharing agreement to a CS compatibility before diving into a longer term commitment later so by taking a revenue share approach initially keeps it a lot more lightweight you don't have to get caught up another legal ease of starting up a company together until further down the line and so you should give this partnership about a 6 to 12 months to mature before you bother doing that okay let's go 50/50 or 60 40 on this company together and do all the legal stuff required to make this a proper Partnership of a company so there you have it the road map to monetize your development skill set and build the career and life of your dreams through this AI opportunity and now all that's left to do is to take
