Description:
Okay, here's a structured summary focusing on the core ideas:

**I. Core Concepts of BOLL**

*   **Complexity:** BOLL is deceptively simple but requires understanding of multiple time cycles (daily, weekly, monthly) for effective use.
*   **Profit/Loss Ratio:** BOLL is powerful for calculating potential profit/loss ratios at different entry points, which is crucial for successful trading.

**II. Multi-Cycle Analysis**

*   **Daily View:**  A single daily chart is insufficient for analysis. Strength is determined by higher highs and higher lows
*   **Weekly View:** Trends may appear differently when viewed on a weekly chart.
*   **Monthly View:** Monthly charts offer the broadest perspective, and can identify strong trends not visible on shorter cycles
*   **Combined:** Must combine trends across different cycles. e.g. daily line may be weak but monthly may be strong.

**III. Buying Points and Profit/Loss**

*   **Ideal Entry:** The middle line of the BOLL band often provides the best profit/loss ratio.
*   **Monthly:** Buy near the mid-line on the monthly chart for a potential 1:4 profit/loss ratio.
*   **Weekly:** Buy near the mid-line on the weekly chart for a potential 1:5 to 1:6 profit/loss ratio.
*  **Daily** Buying near the mid-line, but only after an upward cross provides a relatively high profit/loss ratio

**IV. BOLL Parameters & Opening/Closing**

*  **Parameter Adjustment** Default BOLL parameters are 20 days; changing it to 7 days can be better for spotting opportunities in expanding markets.
*   **Opening:**  Important to understand the BOLL lines expanding (opening).
   *   **Upper Track Opening:** Price moving along the upper band represents a strong bullish trend.
   *   **Lower Track Opening:** Price moving along the lower band indicates a strong bearish trend. Avoid this.
*   **Closing:**  BOLL lines converging (closing) signals the end of a trend, indicating a shift to consolidation. The trend will usually consolidate between the upper and lower bands.
*  **Parameters for Opening**: If BOLL is opening use the 7 parameter, else use the default parameter of 20.

**V.  BOLL Fundamentals**

*   **Middle Track:** Determines the trend.
   *   **Upward Trend:** Upper band = resistance, middle band = support.
   *   **Downward Trend:** Middle band = resistance, lower band = support.
*   **Oscillations:** Upper and lower bands act as resistance and support respectively.

**VI. Integration with Gann**

*   **Combined:** Combining BOLL with Gann analysis can enhance trend prediction.
*  **Rebound Energy:** Understanding rebound energy in conjunction with Gann can offer extra insight into timing trades.

**Conclusion:**

*   Understanding BOLL requires analyzing multiple time cycles, focusing on the best profit/loss ratios at mid-track entry points, and being aware of BOLL opening and closing indicators, all of which can be enhanced by applying the principles of the Gann system.

you everyone. I am Dashuai. Today, Dashuai is here to tell you.  Let’s talk about this high-level tutorial of BOLL. I believe many friends know it. It sounds very simple. In fact, BOLL is very difficult to use. Marshal has not seen a few people who use Bollinger Bands very well. Why? Because Bollinger Bands not only needs to consider changes in small cycles, but also combines large cycles. And one of the biggest features of BOLL is that the profit-loss ratio can help you very well.  It is particularly important to calculate the profit and loss ratio in different periods. Everyone knows that in addition to the winning rate, the most important thing in trading is the profit and loss ratio. So in this lesson, the commander will explain BOLL clearly to everyone through 4 points and give everyone a thank you.  The high-level method allows you to grasp the profit and loss better than grasping an opportunity. It is really useful for you. This index includes everything from Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, futures, commodities, gold and silver, etc. All trends that are completely universal are within BOLL. Of course, there are a few parameters to be set in a while. Dashuai will also share them with you, so please be patient and watch this video. Friends who like it, please also subscribe to Dashuai's channel. Shuai will also release a session of Dashuai for everyone, including Dashuai's judgment on the trend, and a record of Dashuai's combination. You can use it as a reference and understand Dashuai's strength, because many friends may be interested in BOLL.  I already understand it, so the commander will go from difficult to simple to give everyone a little challenge. First of all, if you want to use the Bunin line well, what are the two most difficult points ? The first point must be the combination of multiple cycles. What is it? I will give you a simple example of the combination of multiple cycles. I will take the latest S&P index as an example. You can take a look at the current strength of the S&P index to see if it is OK, right? Let’s look at the daily level now.  At the line level, you can see that the previous zero line boasted that it has been rising along the middle rail all the way up to here, right? Now it has fallen below the middle rail, and it has started to fall along the middle rail, and it has already started to fall deeply. A double bottom looks like it is not strong enough, right? Because his middle bone has gone down. So is his strength enough? This is the daily level. Now, he is not strong because everyone knows, take it.  To put this system in its simplest terms, if it is strong, it must reach two points and one point, which is a new high point, right? The previous S&P high point is still far away, and there is still one point, which is a higher low point.  The higher lows are satisfied, but there are no higher highs yet, so the strength of the daily line level is not enough. So whether its strength is enough, you will make a lot of mistakes just judging the daily line, because sometimes it is obvious  It seems that the daily line is not working anymore and it is going up again. What is the reason? The reason is that it is in multiple cycles. So what happens now? Let’s switch to the weekly line and let’s take a look at the status of the weekly line. You can see the status of the weekly line.  The zero line actually moves in a very standard way. What is the standard method? It grows from the previous one to the upper rail, and the momentum is exhausted, and then touches the lower rail, and then touches the lower rail. After touching the lower rail, it grows to the upper rail again, and there is no way to step back to the middle rail until recently.  It just stepped back to the middle track, so if you look at the weekly chart, you can find that the trend is still okay. Except that there is no opening of the upper track, the trend is still completely upward. Even if it wants to fall, how will it fall? A simple example will also say that it will rise.  It goes up and falls, right? Then step back and then you ca n't get over the previous high and you can't pounce to form a double-headed pullback. It is also such a trend. Then if it succeeds, then it is to go up and step back and then BOLL will open a new high on the upper track and then a new low. Do not add new lows and new highs to form such a strong trend. So this trend has weakened from the daily level, but if you switch to the weekly level, you will find that its trend strength is still enough. Then you cut  When we get to the monthly line level, let's take a look at the monthly line. You will find that its strength is completely sufficient. Why? Let's take a look at the monthly line level. It rises and touches the lower rail. The upper middle rail rushes to the upper rail and returns to the middle rail. Is the opening of the upper rail correct?  And everyone should pay attention to the fact that it has reached a new high. The new high is higher than the previous high, right? The low is higher than the previous one. Then it is absolutely an upward trend at the monthly line level, so everyone should combine this to see the long and short term. You know that although the daily line is correct, the recent strength is obviously not enough. Let's connect the daily line to the latest one, right? But if you look at the monthly line, its strength is completely sufficient. If you look at the weekly line, he didn't say anything.  If it goes completely bad, it is a trend. After seeing the daily decline, you have to pay attention. It is often an opportunity. Especially if it goes to a w-bottom, a double bottom, or even a triple bottom, you must cherish it because it will take several cycles.  They are all upward, especially the big cycles, which are good for upwards. I haven’t finished talking here yet. I don’t know if this friend understands it or not. You can leave a message in the comment area below. I will continue to talk about understanding the trend. Just now  Dashuai has made it clear to everyone that the trend is upward, so where is your buying point? This is the most important question. In fact, it is very simple. What does the profit and loss ratio that Dashuai told you before mean that is not 0? In BOLL  The profit-loss ratio you have to bear when buying at different positions is different. If you want to make a lot of money, you must ensure the best profit-loss ratio. Now I will analyze it for you from several cycles, and then combine it to make a judgment. Everyone understands that first of all, let’s talk about the monthly line. This will be the monthly line state. Then where is the nearest buying point for the monthly line state? This question is actually very simple. The profit and loss ratio is the highest here on the BOLL middle track because the standard trend of the Bollinger Band returns to the upper track.  Step on the middle rail, the middle rail can't hold it, touch the lower rail, hold the double bottom, turn around and stand on the middle rail, then rush to the upper rail, then step back on the middle rail, step on the middle rail, and go up again. At the same time, the Bollinger Band moves toward the middle rail.  The closest buying point on the monthly line is the mid-rail. This is the best buying point on the monthly line. It is where the profit-loss ratio is the highest. If it falls to the mid-rail on the monthly line, you can go a little lower than the mid-rail. You can see this zombie system.  Ah, you can place a little below the middle track, which is a little below our support level, including the previous support intensive area, right? There is a support intensive area. At this position, you can place a buy order. If it falls below, then you  The profit and loss ratio is only so much, but if it goes up, you can make so much. We don't think it's too high. We only count it when it's on track. Your profit and loss ratio is about 1:4. 1:4 or so. This is yours.  A profit and loss ratio is the most cost-effective wave of trading. This is a monthly line. Of course it can grow higher, which is definitely a better upper rail opening and is more comfortable. But a safe profit and loss ratio is only complete in this period, so everyone must do this.  Pay special attention to your best profit and loss ratio and then buy now. Is it okay? But the monthly line does not have the best profit and loss ratio. So let's shrink the cycle and see if there is a profit and loss ratio on the weekly line. In fact, what about the weekly profit and loss ratio? It's very simple, BOLL, touch back to the middle rail, right? Just like the monthly line, the middle rail is the Yin-loss ratio, so the middle rail is a better position. You can set a range to support your loss below the middle rail. Ah, so that everyone can understand, I draw the range of your loss in red, which is a little below the support of the middle rail. Here, the range of your profit is the distance from the middle rail to the upper rail. The middle rail is at the distance from the upper rail.  Where is it? It is here, so this is one of your profit and loss coins. Even conservatively, you can say wipe it off a little, right? You eat less and use the most conservative way because there is pressure on the upper rail. At least you can eat this much, right?  If you don’t, then your profit and loss ratio can reach the range of 1:5 to 1:6. I think this is very suitable. Suppose you enter the market now and enter at this position and still have half of the profit and loss ratio, right? If you enter with the middle  If you aim to raise the cost to the rail, half of the profit and loss will be low, but it will definitely not be as cost-effective as before. So switch back to the daily line, where is your profit and loss ratio? For the daily line, the mid-rail is still downward, but  Now that it has strongly occupied the middle rail, there is a high probability that it will fluctuate back and forth here on the middle rail, or it will go straight up, and then pull the middle rail up and it will go up again. So your profit-loss ratio is in the lower part of the middle rail, probably in the front. In order to distinguish the bottom, I still use red in the previous wave. It is probably your maximum loss range. Your stop loss is set at this line. Then your profit space is so much. Here is all our profit space.  Calculated as a conservative profit margin, we know that after the market starts, it will enter a state of opening on the upper track and keep rising along this upper track, right? But when we calculate it, we calculate it as the most conservative remaining profit margin.  I will explain this game called trend in this market to you later. After I finish explaining it to you, we can see that the current state is one. In fact, the profit-loss ratio of the large-cycle monthly line is not high anymore. It is on the upper track.  It is close to the opening and has risen along the upper track for 2 times. Is the small cycle weekly line correct? It is still near the middle track. The profit and loss ratio is still relatively high, about half of it. The third smallest period is the daily profit and loss ratio, which is relatively high.  It’s almost a little more than half. It’s a little more than half. This is your current avoidance. So in this case, what should you do? Before the big cycle weekly line completely goes wrong, generally this kind of market will end the week.  The line should also touch near the upper track. Then combined with the daily line, you can make a small-period rebound near the upper track to see if the rebound is strong enough to confirm whether to leave the market. I don’t know if my friends can understand what I say. Because here I am explaining my 10 years of trading experience to you all at once. Some friends may understand it at once, and some friends have not yet reacted. So I will continue to explain it to you, but there are many  The overall judgment of the cycle is that it is in such a state. It is very simple, just like a river. We know the market. You can refer to it. The Gran Coin generally follows a standard arc, rising, falling, rising again, right? Assuming this is a monthly cycle. It goes like this, so the weekly cycle, right, is above the monthly line? It rushes a little higher and falls back a little higher. It falls back a little higher. It goes like this, but it’s not necessarily particularly standard, but it’s generally like this, around the monthly line.  Going back and forth, this is the weekly cycle and then the daily cycle, this will be smaller, right? It is based on the weekly cycle, right? The white line is the daily cycle, it is based on the weekly cycle. This is why we have to look at multiple cycles to combine the skeleton with a large cycle and a meridian with a small cycle. Finally, there is a muscle with the minimum cycle. Finally, there is a hair with the minimum cycle. For example, when we have  It also takes 60 minutes to make the buying and selling point, which is a hair of the smallest cycle. In this way, you can clearly see what kind of range the market is, and you can also think clearly about what level you will be in. The adjustment of the cycle is special.  It's important, friends, to think clearly about what level you are at. The adjustment of the cycle is particularly important. Why is it so important? Let me give you a simple example. Everyone knows that there is a common trend that is unclear. The larger the cycle, the more obvious it is. What trend is this? When it goes up, it attacks from the lower rail to the middle rail, and then the middle rail oscillates and oscillates. After the attack reaches the upper rail, the upper rail oscillates and continues to attack. After the upper rail oscillates and oscillates, it continues to attack the upper rail. Then it returns to the upper rail and ends. Suppose you put this  Think of it as a cycle. Let’s not talk about what time it is, but the logic is the same. The larger the time range of this cycle, the larger the time space you have to endure. Let me give a simple example. For example, this picture here uses a monthly line. Then  If the monthly line is on the upper rail, look back at the upper rail and cannot pass it, or the monthly line has entered a box shock cycle. In this cycle, one of your shock ranges is the monthly line level. To give a simple example, for example, this section is our most common one.  The graph rises to near the upper track and then continues to rise for two months. So when you find that you are affected by the monthly line level, what kind of trend will the daily line be in this cycle? It will be a standard shrinking trend. It may be a narrowing trend with a small movement, and then the stock price fluctuates up and down in this. This is the daily cycle trend, so sometimes you may wonder why the daily cycle is such a small trend or like this.  If there is a slight trend, I will wonder why. In fact, it is very simple because the big cycle has reached a cycle of shock, or the monthly line needs to pull back to get closer to the mid-track and look back to accumulate momentum. So when you see this situation, you will know the monthly line level.  If he wants to pull back at the monthly level, how many cycles does the correction usually take? It's very simple, two cycles, right? This is usually the minimum cycle. If it's more, it 's usually 4 cycles, right? Gann has already made it very clear. If you have time, it's also  You can refer to Gann's system. If you really don't understand it, I can explain it a little bit in the future, right? Then you know that the monthly line will be corrected for so many cycles, so your daily line is right, or is your weekly line just right? You can do a swing strategy, right? Do you want to do a oscillating swing strategy? A slight rise and a slight fall, right? Because you want the monthly line. One monthly line equals 4 weekly lines, right, equals 30. Calculate it roughly, 30 daily lines.  Right, the monthly shock for two months is equivalent to the weekly shock of 8 weeks and the weekly shock of 60. Ah, the weekly shock of 8 weeks may not be particularly obvious, because after all, the weekly shock is relatively short, so a shock of 60 days  The range is definitely enough for you. In addition, let’s take a look at the 60-day shock range. Let’s take a look at the monthly lines of this shock range this month. Let’s take a look at the data so that everyone can better understand. This shock is in September 2020. These four lines are  From August, September, and October 2020, right, we didn’t look at the daily line, but we cut to August, September, and October 2020. I believe everyone will clearly understand what kind of cycle this is and why we  We must pay attention to a shock in a big cycle. A shock in a big cycle will definitely be very troublesome. It will definitely be very painful. Well, let’s take a look at where August, September, and October 2020 start. It just starts from here.  Right, until October, counting the last line, it is such a range. Do you think it has a very standard bottom? It goes up from here, then falls back and comes up, falls back and comes up again, forming a standard one.  Is the shock range of the box correct? Then if you understand the trend of the monthly line, in such a shock range, you will be able to figure out what kind of transactions you should do because you all know that the market is fluctuating. Is n’t it very simple? Then some friends may say, Marshal, I know it is oscillation, but I don’t know how he oscillates the space. This is actually very simple, right? If it oscillates the space, generally speaking, according to the standard BOLL, right, the middle rail to the upper rail is  His oscillation space, but everyone should pay attention to it. This is an opening state. In the opening state, you cannot use the standard parameters of BOLL. So what parameters should we use for the opening state? We need to use special parameters. Here, the commander will share with you. Here we are going to use a magic number, which is 7. Let’s take a look and see if it is very standard. Let’s zoom out and see if the support and pressure position of each monthly line is very clear. Is it your monthly line?  If you want to buy something on the line, it’s easy to buy. Buy at each support level. Buy at the support level. Buy at the support level. Buy at the support level. Buy at the support level. Buy at the support level. Even if it goes up the track and opens, you can easily buy it. This is Dashuai 10. A parameter of the upper rail opening summarized from years of experience. Now that we have talked about the parameters, let me share them with you. First of all, you must know what the parameter settings of BOLL are. Here we open the BOLL settings and tell you about them. BOLL  The parameters are here. The commander used the attached picture, so the name of this parameter is SD, and then the width is below. In fact, it is very simple. Some of the first parameters above are used by everyone, right? What is forever?  What is the daily moving average of the middle rail? Because you set 20 here, right? The middle rail is the 20-day moving average. You set 7 here, which means the 7-day moving average is used as the middle rail. And the following is the standard deviation. Generally, we don't want it.  Move because you can see that after changing the number to this magical 7, the standard deviation is actually very accurate, including if you want to do t, it is very easy, right? Buying on the upper rail is the same, selling on the middle rail, buying on the upper rail, selling on the middle rail, buying on the middle rail, and then it falls to the lower rail. It is also very accurate. You can take a look at it. So why use 7? In fact, 7 is a very magical number. As you know,  There are 7 days in a week, isn't it? It's amazing. It's amazing. It's an open number that the commander summed up his many years of experience. Don't use it if you don't have an open number. If you don't open it, I suggest you use the default parameter of 20. It 's very easy to use, right?  You see, the default parameters have increased to the upper rail, right? Go back to the lower rail. This range is still relatively standard, upper rail, lower rail, upper rail, lower rail, right? But you said that the upper rail has opened its mouth here and pulled it up. Wait.  If it pulls back to the middle track, then you will miss the market and completely disappear. So what are you going to use here? Here you have to use the parameters that the commander just gave you, which is seven. If you write it down, you will find that the trend of the entire market is very magical.  You can see it all clearly at a glance, and it’s still the same rhythm. You’ll always buy, you’ll always buy, you’ll always buy, right? You can also replace the upper rail at any time, replace the upper rail, replace the upper rail, replace the upper rail, replace the upper rail. It’s that simple. It’s that simple. Everyone just uses  Remember this parameter and then set the first parameter representing the moving average to 7 in the settings. It is very simple and easy to use. You can take a look for yourself, right? For this kind of upper track opening, it is the main point.  The sound stage is particularly useful. I won’t explain too much. This is one of Dashuai’s own trading experiences. If you think other parameters are more useful, you can also modify them. But here, Dashuai shares his own. You can  It's still very useful for reference. If you feel you are not used to it, you can use yours. This is the meaning of the parameters. The BOLL parameters. And just now the commander told you a very important point, which is to open the mouth. Especially in the use of BOLL.  An important point that cannot be ignored is the opening. Everyone must pay attention to the opening and closing. The most important point of BOLL is that it cannot be ignored. What is opening? Let me give you a simple example. Let's switch to the daily level. The daily level will be more obvious. What is an opening? An opening means that the upper rail and the lower rail are opened and spaced apart. Let's find a standard example of this section to give you an example. Let's look at this section. This section is a standard opening. The meaning of opening is that the upper rail goes upward.  When walking at the same time, the lower rail needs to go downward. This is called opening. Everyone must pay attention. They are not moving in the same direction, which is called opening. So this section is called opening. Opening, and it is the rest of the opening. As long as the upper rail keeps moving.  Go up and then the upper rail and the middle rail. The distance between the lower rail and the middle rail is called the continuation opening. But the continuation opening is not very important. Only this section is important. The section just opened is particularly important. This section is particularly important. Don't even wait.  After he finished speaking, he missed the opportunity. So how to grasp the opening is actually very simple. That is, the skeleton moves along the upper rail of the BOLL. This is a characteristic of the opening, which is what we often call the main sound wave. You can find it in this  In the wall situation, he is very strong. He will not hit the ghost as easily as he did during the contraction period, right? He will not hit the ghost easily because he has entered the stage of strong rise, right. In this stage, it is difficult for you to chase unless  You use the magical parameters that the commander just mentioned, right? Once you type it, you will find that hey, how can the commander open his mouth to chase so easily? But before that, if you use the default parameters or you don’t understand, you will find out  This BOLL seems to be of no use. If you open it late, you can't do it. It seems that if it rises, it won't provide opportunities. That is, if you understand it, you can continue to do it well. Then this is the opening. The opening represents the start of the trend. There are two types of openings. That's what it is. It's also an opening. The stock price moves along the upper track, which is called an upper track opening. This is very important. This is a strong characteristic. So what are the weak characteristics? You have to be particularly careful, right? The weak characteristic is that the stock price also moves along the upper track.  Moving along the lower track is called a lower track opening. This is something you must avoid, right? We can see that the stock price is also opening along the lower track, that is, falling toward the lower track. This situation is an opportunity for shorting, so everyone must distinguish clearly.  Ah, it is very important whether you have an opportunity to rise or to go short here. And there is another situation, that is, when the unknown line goes flat, this situation is an opportunity for shocks. That means it has not opened or contracted, right? Slow down here.  Slow shock, this kind of shock opportunity basically means that the market falls from the upper track to the lower track and then rises from the lower track to the upper track. Then when it opens, it closes, right? What does closing mean? Closing means the end of the market.  One meaning is that this big rise has turned into a shock, and it has begun to merge. Let me find a more extreme example for everyone to see more clearly. In fact, generally speaking, the closing market is not particularly large. Generally speaking, it will fluctuate in this big cycle.  The monthly level fluctuations that I just told you about may enter a closing market. You should pay special attention to this kind of market. It means that the short-term market is over and the short-term market is gone. This is  A common feature of closing is that there are generally not many closings. Let’s look at this section. This is called closing. The upper rail and the lower rail close to the middle at the same time, right? After closing, it enters a stage of narrow range oscillation. This is called closing. Then  After closing, the resistance is on the upper rail. The support is on the lower rail. The resistance is on the upper rail. Unless the middle rail pulls up again and enters an upward state, it is that simple. The commander has told you so much. What he said today is very in-depth.  Ah, I don’t know if you can understand. In fact, I originally wanted to tell you about the cooperation between this ineffective line and other things because of the cooperation with this ISI and this general system. But this time is limited, I won’t go into too much because of Brin.  I haven’t finished talking about the lines yet, okay. Next, let me tell you the basics of Bollinger Bands. If you already understand, then here you should fully understand what the commander is talking about. If you don’t understand, you can take a look. Thank you also for subscribing to Dashuai’s channel. Dashuai, as an old trader with 10 years of experience, also wants to share Dashuai’s own experience with everyone. Later, I will share with you one of Dashuai’s accounts.  How should we do it to give you a prediction of the trend in advance? So the simplest ones that are not 0, I will briefly summarize them in 2 minutes. Then the middle track of the Bollinger Band determines the trend, because when the middle track goes up The trend is upward. When the trend is upward, the upper rail is the resistance and the middle rail is the support. So it will go up like this until it goes up and returns to the devil within the devil. When the upper ghost returns to the devil, the ghost grows, the upper ghost returns to the devil, this is a standard that does not work without changing the parameters. If you want to grasp every wave, then you still have to modify the parameters. Of course, it must be the upper ghost who opens his mouth. Then it falls.  The trend is completely opposite to the downward trend. The middle rail is downward, so the middle rail is a support. The middle rail is a pressure. The lower rail is a support. So it becomes a rebound. The middle rail is falling. The lower rail is rebounding. The middle rail is falling. The lower rail is rebounding.  If the middle rail falls back and the lower rail rebounds, the middle rail falls back to the lower rail, and until the middle rail goes flat, then you have to pay attention, either it will enter the shock stage or it will go up, so every time the middle rail goes flat, it is the place where the trend may turn, everyone.  You must be aware of it in your mind. The most common thing is that it shakes near the middle rail and flattens the middle rail, and then goes back up. This is a very common thing. Everyone must pay attention. You must pay attention. Then the oscillation trend will be very simple. There is no need.  I said that the upper rail is resistance. The standard for drawing a shock trend is three lines, right? The upper rail is resistance and the lower rail is support. It’s just like what you just saw, right ? Just follow the middle rail and don’t care much until the middle rail goes up.  Let's start walking like this, or go down the middle rail, start walking like this, right? Then this is the upper rail, this is the lower rail. It's that simple. So in a non-spiritual way, it's still difficult for you to understand it deeply, but you  I just want to have a brief understanding. It’s actually very simple. Finally, I suggest you combine it with the Gann system, because I like it because I have studied Gann a lot. With Gann, you can better judge a trend. For example, in  Here BOLL, the middle rail is downward, so we know that the middle rail is resistance and the lower rail is support. It is very simple to say it. You will understand it once you hear it. Then I ask you, when a big positive line he boasts here pulls up the middle rail, do you  Dare you open a short position, right? You may be thinking, Marshal, didn’t you say that this middle track is resistance ? Then it should drop and pull here. Why did it pull here? This is a continuation of the strength of the rebound. So do you dare to open a short position here? I believe that many friends may not dare to go long and get trapped instead. In fact, this is easy to understand. You can use Jiang An's idea to set up a trap. It is actually very simple. Are there any new highs? Are there any new lows? Still, in this case, he has not reached the attitude of trend reversal. If he wants the trend to reverse, there are two points. In short, he has to break through the previous high point to get this position. You can think that he has reversed far. From this position, it will not fall through the previous point. If it falls here, it will start to rebound effectively and stand on the previous high point again. You can also think of this as a reversal, but you will find that it  None. He chose to go from this position to a few highs, right, a few lows, and then fell to a new low. And then this high did not break through. Then you should go short here, go short here, go short here, right? Even you  If you can’t judge so accurately, you ’ll usually go short where the upper rail is lower than the upper rail. Because it’s from the middle rail downward, no matter how strong its rebound is, it usually won’t rise to the upper rail all at once. This content is quite profound. You can understand it. You can understand it.  Think about it, you can also take a look at this content of Gann. What Gann said is very clear, including his rebound kinetic energy. You have to take it into consideration, right? What is his rebound kinetic energy? This wave rebounds this wave.  How many days did it fall? How many days did it rebound? How many days did it take for this wave of decline? You can also simply draw an angle line to judge it. I have said so much. I believe many friends have already heard it. But what about the commander?  I still want to share one of Dashuai's own experiences with you, and I hope more friends can trade to eat meat, trade to make big money, and fulfill a dream in life.
