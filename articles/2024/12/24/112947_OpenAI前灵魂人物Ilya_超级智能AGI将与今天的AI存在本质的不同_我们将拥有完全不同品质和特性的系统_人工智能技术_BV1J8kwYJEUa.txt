Description:
*   超智能将与现有技术有质的区别，因为它具备真正的推理能力。
*   推理系统随着推理的深入，会变得更加不可预测。
*   深度学习模拟的是人类直觉，而推理则具有不可预测性，即使是顶尖的人类也难以预测顶级推理AI的行为。

**结论：超智能的推理能力使其在本质上不同于现有技术，并可能带来难以预料的行为。**

 And the thing about superintelligence is that it will be different qualitatively from what we have. It will actually reason. And by the way, I want to mention something about reasoning. Is that a system that reasons the more it reasons, the more unpredictable it becomes. All the deep learning that we've been used to is very predictable because if you've been working on replicating human intuition essentially, it's like the gut feel. If you come back to the 0.1 second reaction time, what kind of processing we do in our brains? It's our intuition. So if you've been doubt, RRIs be some good intuition. But reasoning, and you're seeing some early signs of that, reasoning is unpredictable. And one reason to see that is because the ChSAIs, the really good ones, are unpredictable to the best human chess players. And of course, they will have incredible and amazing capabilities. But the kind of issues that come up with systems like this, and I'll just leave it as an exercise to imagine. It's very different from what we used to.
