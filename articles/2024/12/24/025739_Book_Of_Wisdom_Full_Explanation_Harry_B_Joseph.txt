Description:
Okay, here's a structured summary focusing on the core ideas:

**I. Consciousness & Spirituality:**

*   **Plants:** Smoking is a ritual, inhaling the plant's spirit and merging consciousness. Intention dictates the effect (positive or negative). Moderation is key; avoid reliance for escape.
*   **Body:** The body is an electromagnetic machine needing electric (sun-grown) food. Fasting promotes cell regeneration. The body's strength reflects mental state.
*   **Soul:** Humans are light beings, with the soul being the internal sun, and the body a vessel. The soul system is within, the human is a microcosm of the universe,  Consciousness is God.
*   **Mind:**  The mind is the root of reality.  External realities are reflections of internal states (thoughts/emotions).  The universe is mental; the mind creates. One's mind is a powerful tool to control reality and must be protected.
*  **Emotions** Emotions are magnetic; Positive thoughts and emotions strengthen one's energy field and overall health.
*   **Spiritual States:**  Heaven and hell are states of consciousness, not places; the "devil" is low-level desire. Self-mastery is essential for spiritual progress.

**II.  The Hidden Nature of Reality:**

*   **Geometry:** Squares limit the mind; ancient structures used pointed roofs for energy flow. The shape of surrounding structures affects one's perception of reality.
*   **Celestial Influences:** Planets/stars relate to chakras, elements, days; these influence human consciousness. The moon enhances psyche, with its cycles impacting emotions and physiology.
*   **Music:**  Manipulates emotions; can hypnotize/reprogram the subconscious. Society is influenced by music's vibrational effects.
*   **Flat Earth:**  The Earth is flat.
*   **Simulation:** The physical world is a simulation, a projection of the mind;  the body is a VR headset for experiencing this reality.
*  **Language and Vibrations** Words and sounds have vibrations that impact reality. The vibrations affect the structure of water which the body is mainly composed of.
*  **Symbols**  Symbols speak to the subconscious mind and have specific hidden meanings.

**III.  The Body & Health:**

*   **Food:**  Unnatural foods cause inflammation; focus on natural, electric foods grown under the sun. Food resembles the body parts they benefit.  GMOs are not recognized by the body.
*  **Digestion:** The sun powers the digestive system; Chew food until it's liquid; don't mix foods, especially meat with other starches.
*   **Internal Balance:** The gut health is a reflection of what's happening internally, remove unnatural foods for optimal health.  Physical issues are internal problems manifesting outwardly.
*   **Heart:** Not just a pump, but a vortex energy generator connected to the Earth, and an "emotional brain." The heart contains the guidance and intelligence in a person's body and is connected to the wisdom teeth.

**IV. Self-Mastery & Transformation:**

*   **Sexuality:** Semen retention is powerful; sex is a ritual; avoid low-vibration encounters; low vibrations attract negative entities. Transmutation of sexual energy is key for higher levels of awareness and power.
*   **Subconscious:**  The subconscious is programmed by beliefs; actively control dreams and manifestations.
*   **Awareness:**  Pay attention to your thoughts/emotions; your body is the temple; you must overcome ego for spiritual growth.  
*   **Inner God:** Seek the divine within oneself; manifest a reality aligned with the inner self.
*   **"Devil"**: The Devil is not an entity it is an aspect of mind.
*   **Ethereal University:** Access to deeper esoteric knowledge and practices, including astral projection and lucid dreaming.

**Fundamental Point:** You are a powerful consciousness, a universe within yourself, and through self-mastery and understanding the true nature of reality, you can shape your experience and realize your divine potential.

conscious mind the Moon is your subconscious mind thoughts and emotions Earth is your body water is your emotions fire is your spirit and air is your mind this is why the Bible has four gospels to

cerebellum is the cbum the lower brain ruled by Taurus cereb Ram which is the Lamb of God which is the Aries hips means hippo which means horse which is Sagittarius the four seasons of the sun happen

time you eat something unnatural it causes inflammation within the body which then weakens the organs over time food is specifically designed to look like the body parts it's beneficial for this is for the stomach raspberries is for the blood this is why it's red blueberries is for the eyes ears is for mushrooms tomato for the heart grapes for the lungs and walnuts for the brain your body does not recognize any of these Foods because they are GMO they're not good for you did you know cans are laced with a BPA plastic lining fragrance can be up to 10,000 toxic synthetic chemicals plastic chopping boards put plastic in your food and nonstick pans are coated with Teflon which is a lifelong chemical toilet paper uses chlorine to bleach the paper you could eat the most healthiest diet in the world but if you think and feel negative this destroys your health the body follows the mind the mind is the root cause of all reality you can think your way into illness see no evil speak no evil hear no evil protect your mind at all costs because your life is an externalization of your mind I've had many questions about schillig it I personally do not take it if you want to learn more about health and wonder what this book is called It's called The Human Health guide you can get the PDF in my bio the devil is the deviling of your Consciousness when your mind is in a physical reality lust food money Fame power this is the devil red is the lowest vibrational color on the color spectrum which corresponds to the surface level of your Consciousness he has goat horns symbolizing an animal this is the animal nature of human consciousness red symbolizes Rage which is the lack of emotional control deep down within you you are the fabric of the universe itself you have the ability to create turn thought into physical existence this pencil was a thought before it is a physical reality you possess the power of creation you can use this for good or evil do evil is the devil and God is good reptilians do not exist we're not being controlled by reptiles there are three parts of the brain The Reptilian Brain is mainly used when one is using survival needs this is the instinctual part of your nature people who control this world are mainly operating in their Reptilian Brain it's all a metaphor it's all scarcity to make you fear head is the heaven Earth is the heart and heel is the hell these are all states of Consciousness so is God and so is the devil the church is a scam the devil doesn't exist the devil is your own aspect of your mind tempting you to engage in low-level Pleasures I will never recover from these images that I've just found Giants definitely existed take a look at the size of these people only around a 100 years ago now imagine the size of these people around 500 years ago or a thousand years ago they would have been 10 times bigger than this the oxygen levels were way higher a thousand years ago so just imagine the size of these people now what I'm going to show you at the end is going to blow your mind I think these people were purposely wiped out why do we not see them now what happened to their genetics why have they not reached this generation one thing that you may have not noticed which is the fashion these people are wearing why has Humanity lost their sense of beauty and classiness I have yet to see one obese person in any of these images which is absolutely crazy they all look healthy well informed and well-mannered Humanity has truly lost their ways now take a look at this maybe this is why the Egyptians showed giant people in their artwork and maybe their statues were the true size of these humans I thank you all for being part of this journey I've now hit 1 million followers on Tik Tok there are three aspects of your Consciousness thoughts emotions and actions if you align them all towards your goals you will create the reality that you want to celebrate use the code wisdom for 40% off the book of wisdom or anything in the store Jesus never existed Jesus represents the son with his 12 disciples the 12 Zodiac signs Matthew Mark Luke and John Aquarius Scorpio Leo and Taurus these are the four fixed signs of the zodiac which are the four-fold nature of a human being aquarius's air which is your mind your mental body Scorpio is water which is your emotional body Taurus is Earth which is your physical body Leo is fire which is your spiritual body Matthew is Aquarius which is air the mental Body Of Consciousness Matthew portrays Jesus as intellectual and communicative which is the nature of air your mental body Mark is the lion which is Leo the fire Gospel of Mark shows Jesus with passion and divine leadership and power Mark depicts Jesus as the Son of God which is spirituality and inspiration Luke is Taurus which is the Earth element the physical body Luke portrays Jesus as the man service and comp comp passion Luke emphasizes Jesus's concern for physical material needs of others Gospel of John is Scorpio which is water the emotional aspect of our Consciousness John shows Jesus doing Miracles and shows Jesus as intuitive and transformative these four gospels represent the four aspects of human consciousness Jesus is the son which represents your soul 12 disciples around the one 12 zodiacs around the Sun these are energies of your Consciousness as Within within so without everything outside of you is inside of you the Moon is your mind you can use the moon to your advantage a full moon is very powerful there are more police calls on a full moon than any other day of the month the Moon the Moon enhances our psyche our internal state if you are angry and a full moon comes around this will be enhanced and you will become a monster a moon star or a Luna tick Luna is the moon on a full moon you should be visual izing thinking and feeling the desired reality you want because your intent thoughts and emotions are more powerful on a full moon this is why if you type in witches that always are next to a Full Moon because this is the best time to cast a spell 28 day cycle of the moon 28 day cycle of the menstrual cycle it's in direct correlation with the Moon the Moon governs liquids in your body fasting on a full moon is also very powerful because the water in your body is being pulled by the moon that's why the tides of the ocean follow the Moon moon 28 day cycle this is a month a moon 365 days divided by 28 which is 13 there are 13 monthly Cycles where is the missing month we do not know what year we are truly in people I think they did this to stop us being in syn with the monthly cycle what do you guys think water is emotion Jesus never turned water into wine he transmuted negative emotion to a positive emotion water into wine it's a parable talking about purifying your internal State and raising your frequency a sin is not an act it's an emotion an emotion that stops you from reaching the highest States Of Consciousness seven deadly sins are internal states that lower your frequency baptism is a Lie the four elements correspond with your State of Consciousness pouring water on your head you moved from the Earth element the lowest State of Consciousness into the water which is the purification of one's Consciousness water symbolizes the first stage of Awakening and the purific ation process then fire represents your full transformative Awakening air represents communication and the mental aspect of your Consciousness and spirit is the highest state most people are operating on the surface level of their Consciousness you are Consciousness your body is not you there is a battle between your Consciousness and your body the Flesh and God you must crucify yourself and sacrifice Yourself by giving up your ego and fleshly desire to God Five Wounds on the cross are the five senses you must give up material desire to your Consciousness to be born again ethereal University will give you long form lectures plus a liy filled with a cult Bo BN is free because you are the product you are paying with your semen the astral liquid of the Soul this is why you're so tired after you release because it's your etheric life force which you are draining releasing may cause you to become mineral deficient Sean retention allows the body to recycle the minerals in the fluid to feed the body sex is the most powerful emotion the human can feel the semen has the minerals to create a whole another human being so imagine how powerful this is when you retain it you should only release when having a baby now this is where transmutation comes in you can transmute the saved energy you've saved from not releasing into critical thinking or any activity you want you will be stronger your energy will be through the roof and you will attract more people your generative energy is the most powerful energy your body has do not waste it which then allows the brain to process more information and be enlightened you'll literally become a superhuman by saving your seed Jesus never existed he represents a high State of Consciousness which you can reach religion is the externalization of Truth a sin is not an action it's an internal emotion which goes against the higher self that's why the seven deadly sins are emotions and internal States these stop you from Reaching Your Potential of Christ Consciousness women hold the portal to gain access to the physical world that's what the Egyptian onk is it's the portal the Egyptians wore the headdress to symbolize the woman because they are the Master Builders which creates the human Temple the human body is formed by the astral forces of the 12 Zodiac inside of the womb that's why your body is made out of 12 cell sorts which are from the 12 Zodiac signs she harnesses the energies of the seven planets and the 12 constellations to manifest your body she is a wombman and she is feminine which is nine he is masculine which is line zero and one one the binary code of all creation that's why there's 10 numbers she is curvy he is liny because everything's geometry which is God's codes to the simulation you are a soul an astral entity in a physical body when the male finishes in the woman this creates a portal in the astral plane seex is a ritual and if you do not do the ritual High vibrationally you will attract a low vibrational astral entity to be incarnated in the physical plane every person you have S ex ex with you have an astral emotional bond with that person if you want a high vibrating soul to enter the physical plane as your child you need to do the ritual properly never engage in one night stands this is a form of magic if you drink alcohol you're drinking magic potions which invoke spirits and yes the Earth is a flat plane you're not fat your gut is just bloated your cortisol levels are probably pretty high which is giving you skin acne tired all day puffy face and always taking naps to to get rid of this to this you must remove all unnatural Foods your gut only recognizes Natural Foods grown by the Earth unnatural Foods activates the defense system which causes inflammation and mucus to be sent to this area you don't have skin issues you don't have body odor you don't have bad breath you have a toxic rotting gut with leftover food in it everything outside of your body is an internal problem if I was to encounter any issues with my body I would go on a single fruit diet preferably blueberries a watermelon while taking seamoss and herbs I'll do this for 2 weeks and then maintain this diet while fasting 2 days a week plus grounding daily as well as being in the sun daily you won't lose weight you lose impurities after a month you'll gain all of these benefits if you need to heal and you don't know what to do the human health guide will give you all the Essential Knowledge you do not see into reality the eyes are black holes they suck in the light in the images produced at the back of the brain called the visual cortex this is because the universe is a mental projection and it's the number one law in the cabalian that all is mind the universe is mental you never actually feel the external world when you touch something this is your brain's interpretation of electrical signals on your nervous system you touch taste smell hear and see with your brain you're not in the world the world is being simulated from the brain and the body it's a piece of technology your body is the Earth the Sun is your soul the moon represents your mind your body is an advanced VR headset which produces a simulation you are the Universal Mind The Observer behind your thoughts emotions and senses there is only one of us in the universe and that is God the one Consciousness is what gives life to every single living life form there is only one Consciousness there is only one God and there is only one number which is the number one which is the letter I the I am within you is the universal Consciousness which is God government they govern your meant your mind your environment is a product of your mind and the elements exist in your mind and they advertise to your men your mind there is not one thing you can't think of every possibility exists in the mind the mind is an infinite metaphysical Consciousness your brain is a supercomputer they're not the same thing the book of wisdom explains everything stop praying to Jesus instead do this in Mark 11 whatever you pray for believe that you receive them and you shall have them this is powerful because it tricks your subconscious mind into believing that you have something before you actually have it and 90% of your actions on a daily basis are the same as yesterday because of the programs in the subconscious reason why people's lives are so messed up is because they're praying from a place of negativity which is tricking their subconscious they want this it takes everything you say as truth why do you think the golden rule is to treat others like you want to be treated it's because of the subconscious Jesus says in John in that day you will no longer ask me anything because Jesus this understood you have the creative power of God of manifesting your own reality this has even been proven your Consciousness interacts with an energy grid around you reflecting your internal States essentially your brain is a supercomputer simulating a holographic reality and your thoughts and emotions alter the fabric of reality when you're not observing something it exists as a light wave when your Consciousness interacts with it it collaps it into a particle into a reality when Jesus says I am the light of the world it's that I am within you is the light of the world we are all the universe itself experiencing its own reality volume two will be available soon join the email list to be notified when it's available alcohol means body eating spirit alol in Arabic that's why vodka is called spirits a gin is a gin which is another type of spiritual entity alcohol was developed by Alchemists who developed a way of extracting Spirits from liquid alcohol is a form of a magic potion which the Ancients used to alter their Consciousness they don't tell you about the astral and etheric plane the Realms Beyond physical alcohol contains ethanol which is ethanol which is the barrier between the physical and the astral plane ancient magicians used potions to enhance their speed strength or whatever they want alcohol is a demonic potion which enhances aggression and violence because you're being possessed by these entities in the astral plane alcohol weakens your vibrational field which allows these entities to enter your body this is why people change to dark behaviors when they're Intoxicated The entities within them engage in violence and low-level sexual encounters the whole world is drinking magic potions used for witchcraft why do you think you can buy alcohol in every shop and there's a pub on every street alcohol also weakens the immune system kills brain cells and reduces amounts of oxygen to reach the brain magic never disappeared it was veiled in myths and stories

growing from a seed bearing the fruit of the heart which looks like a fruit dangling on a tree the tree growing from the seed also feeds the fruit of the spirit the cycle of the seed is the same cycle of your life cycle of the seed is also the same as the parable of the sewer 12 cranial nerves managing the movement of the body being controlled by the Mind 12 disciples spreading the Gospel of Jesus Jesus is the head Jesus meets his disciples in the upper room 12 imams of Shia 12 tribes of Israel with the one left out 12 zodiac constellations around the Sun are you starting to see it you are the Son of God Consciousness is connected to the source of the universe brain is a holographic computer projecting this reality Consciousness is a fractal of God your life is a file your brain is the husband your heart is the wife the husband or the brain is responsible for thinking taste touch hearing and smelling and sight wife is the heart which is submissive to the brain emotion following and doing you're arguing because it's the brain against the heart thinking versus emotion you must learn how to syn the mind with the heart by studying the body you can study how relationships are truly meant to be the book in my bio will tell you everything take a look at this a TV presenter accidentally did the bamat symbol this was done live on television but there is something more to this symbol the baat is good it's not evil religion has Miss educated you to think it's evil I'm going to break this down to you from top to bottom so that you can gain an understanding first of all symbols speak to your subconscious mind symbols activate thoughts in The Invisible Realms of Mind symbols are keys to understand higher things the symbol can be used for good and the bad the goat is a ground animal represents the lower self the ego the wings are an air animal represents the higher self the elevated State the Dome he's sitting on is the Earth element the fish scales on the stomach are the water element we have the fire element also representing human Enlightenment the higher self and the Kundalini the wings also represent the air element As Above So Below what happens in the mind happens in your external reality the moon represents emotion the feminine aspect of your Consciousness the Moon is either on top of you ruling your body or you are standing on top of the Moon controlling your emotions this is not the devil horns it represents the lower self the moon controlling you your emotions he's male and female representing polarity of the physical plane left and right the bamat is a symbol which symbolizes the transformation from the lower mind to the higher mind to asleep to a wakened and Enlightenment I have a whole new book of wisdom coming soon which will explain absolutely everything in deta Noah's Arc never existed it's a metaphoric story about you Noah's Ark is in your brain Noah meets God on a mountain the mountain is your spine and God is your Consciousness the mountain represents a heightened state of awareness a higher Consciousness that's why Moses goes on a mountain to meet with God God then floods the Earth To Kill All Flesh Earth rearranged is heart desire comes from the heart and he flooded the Earth which is the heart with water which represents truth and Enlightenment God never killed everyone on the earth it's metaphorical For You killing the desire of Flesh and the desire of physical things and replenishing the heart in order to progress spiritually and mentally you have to heal the heart because this is where all of your desire comes from you must become God to know God how can you know God if you are Desiring the worldly physical things all religion stems from the Mastery of yourself to become God none of the characters in The Bible existed none of the stories are true stories it's all metaphorical written in code to how you raise yourself out of the lower carnal mind the link is in my bio for the book of was get charged in a court because you're a battery and then go to a prison cell which is a battery cell where it holds your energy they're harvesting your energy in prison if you astral project and go to a prison you'll see this for self energy cannot Escape cubes everything today is built in cubes to trap energy the Ancients knew this this is why their rooms were never Square they had pointed roofs for energy to escape everything you see molds your mind in some form or way cubes and squares are the most limited shapes by seeing cubes and squares all the time this is subconsciously limiting our minds the Ancients built with beauty and sophistication because they understood what they see has an effect on their mind they changed this to this to dull us down to make things more simple to make you more simple environment it's all mental it all has an effect on your mind think you can work this one out yourself minds are expanding and people are progressing inside of the Ethereal University do not stay in the shadow of ignorance progress your life with knowledge people there's nothing holy about Israel it's an allegory Isis raw and L left feminine and right masculine brains when these two electrical forces unify and become the star David this is when you unlock L which means god Consciousness the Holy Land is Your Consciousness it's an elevated State of Consciousness why do you think Moses went up a mountain to meet with God it's an allegory for raising your frequency raising your Consciousness to altering it Beyond physical Noah's Ark he goes on the mountain with God and kills all of the flesh it's allegorical for raising your Consciousness and killing the desire for physical flesh flesh and physical material things because your mind is not a part of the physical plane it's a higher Dimension the mind is God the Bible's written in allegorical code so that engages us to use our right brains and decipher things and engage in critical thinking today we're just giving everything we're giving information this is why we're so stupid we need to use and our right brains and decipher symbols this is why the Ancients were so Advanced have you ever looked away from Earth into the black void yeah so yeah you can see yeah you yeah so yeah you can see yeah you can see the stars oh yeah you know oh yeah you know and uh pretty much all the time you can see the stars there's more than Stars you can see planets you can see moons we were never able to see stars from the lunar surface I don't call during the period of time that we were photographing the Sona girl what what stars we could see I don't remember seeing any in its beauty and and you do your best to to take pictures of it it's just it's just flat and gorgeous to see it's just flat gorgeous to see flat earthers man you guys are so stupid like you genuinely believe that you live on a Motionless plane which is what we observe and that the sun and the moon are close to us and relatively the same size which is what it looks like and that water can't curve which we've never seen happen uh what was the scariest moment of the journey scariest it didn't happen it didn't happen it could have been scary it could have been scary okay I'm going to get the pro 99 proceeded 3 2 1 Mission run our way Houston B for good X truth is always hidden in plain sight who remembers playing hopscotch as a child you're probably wondering what this tree represents it's The Descent of manifestation all creation begins as an emanation from the Mind thought from subtle thought unfolds into spirit and then descends into matter you are not the body you are the Divine mind your whole life you've been bringing thought into physical reality Malu you come from Heaven which is the higher Realms of Consciousness and you descended into physical reality Luke 10:18 I watch Satan fall from Heaven like a flash of lightning here is heaven here's the flashh of lightning it's the Manifest St ation of Mind into matter you represent Satan a fallen State of Consciousness because matter is the lowest State of Consciousness 10 spheres 22 different Pathways and one death which adds up to 33 Jesus is the body the Christ is the Divine mind within you and you manifested through the 33 segments of this tree into Malou you died on the cross which is your body and got the Five Wounds the five senses of the physical Universe Malu you came from Spirit to matter now you got to go from matter to Spirit through Spiritual Awakening mental transmutation and love Christians knew about it and it's even on your hands Hopscotch is a game which represents the path back to Source back to God book of wisdom Volume 2 is nearly ready people never wondered why if you minus all of the numbers on a clock it adds up to six well here's why six is the number of time space and matter it represents the three-dimensional material World up down left right backwards and forward it's a six-sided Cube 60 minutes in an hour 60 seconds in a minute 24 hours in a day 2 + 4 = 6 that's 666 in total this is why you see black cubes everywhere you go or the Nintendo GameCube Jesus cross is a cube unfolded Jews wear a cube on top of their heads and there's a reason why we say think outside the box this is where it gets a bit crazy 666 is the exact same structure of carbon and your body's made out of carbon the body is the mark of the beast the mark of this three-dimensional Material World when the Bible says Satan who's the God of this world it represents Saturn which is the god of time everything dies in time therefore time is the God of this world it rules this world everything physical began as a thought in the mind the physical world is a shadow or an effect of thought Therefore your physical body is stuck in time but your mind is outside of time this is why your mind can go in the past and the future but your body cannot thinking outside the box is a term referring to thinking outside of the physical plane which is activating the light bodies the Eternal self also known as astral projection what I'm saying is your body is nothing you are not your body you are the Eternal Consciousness which is not bound by the physical plane you just have to awaken these other bodies is witchcraft you are using words to alter your reality words create vibrational frequencies praying over food is changing the vibrational frequency of the water in the food they are raising the vibration ation of the food before they place it in their body each cell in our body responds to the frequencies produced by thoughts words and emotions holding their hands together is an ancient form of meditation because your hands are manifestations of your brain hemispheres placing them together completes the electrical circuit of the brain and the body and allows electrical energy to flow through the meridians of the body this technique was used to balance the hemispheres of the brain during meditation to access a higher Consciousness Jesus even says no longer will you ask me for anything instead of praying to Jesus the Bible says believe that you receive them and you shall have it this way you trick the subconscious mind in believing that you already have it which will manifest into your reality you attract what you are music is Magic be careful what you listen to because it molds your mind dreams carry messages dreaming is a low powerered astral projection you are leaving the physical body the conscious mind into the subconscious Realms of the astral imagination realm astral plane is the screen in your mind that allows you to IM imagine an apple if you see Jesus in your dream this is not Jesus it is your belief materializing in the fourth dimension the imagination realm you know when you have them dreams when people are chasing you this is a negative aspect of your mind which is materializing itself all of the trauma all of the negative events that have happened are stored within your subconscious and these are materializing itself and showing it to you in your dreams everything in your dream is an aspect of your own mind therefore it is showing you messages if you cannot control your dreams this is your subconscious controlling the dream you can't control your dreams because you think it's just a dream when it's not it's actually a whole other reality you are a multi-dimensional Consciousness you must remove the program of it's just a dream before you go to sleep consciously think and feel and believe that you will control your dream throughout the day you need to be doing reality checks by pinching yourself and saying Am I Dreaming this will train your subconscious mind to say this while you are dreaming and when you pinch yourself in your dream you will become Lucid once you are Lucid you can then go gain knowledge and do whatever you want in the Realms of the Mind whatever you do never look into a mirror your body is a temple these Egyptian temples were not for worship these temples were 3D schools which communicated to the student through a sophisticated language of symbols volumes and proportions revealing ancient wisdom they started their journey in the entrance which represents the heels because the temples were built in the human form cuz they understood that God is within man implying that man embodies the universe the same principles that govern man are also the same governing the universe it was a school teaching mental and spiritual Ascension to go from matter to Spirit from heal hell to head Heaven that's why the entrance is at the heels representing the physical plane the physical self the lower carnal mind the body wants the physical Pleasures then raising up through the symbolism in these rooms up to the head Heaven which is the spiritual place it is the spinal column that is The Stairway to Heaven the Bible even talks about this but you're just not reading it correctly the word Yahweh means I am Jesus in French is I am Jesus in Latin is you are us be still and know that I am God it's the I am within you is God I am the light of the world you project your own reality you are the universe experiencing itself you are a fractal of the consciousness of the universe which is God Satan represents your lower carnal mind that wants the fleshly Des desire book of wisdom Volume 2 is nearly you have five fingers for the five elements the skull corresponds with the elements the jawel represents the earth water goes on top of the Earth in the mouth air goes through the nose fire is light in the eyes and spirit is the third eye the four physical elements are the four vibrational states of The Ether or Spirit Five Points on the body for the five elements ether or spirit is the basal physical matter the four elements are the four vibrational states of The Ether it's the most important one and that's why it's always on the top that's why the Middle's finger is swearing because they hid The Ether satanic people turn this upside down to put Spirit on the bottom because they are materialists they represent Saturn this symbol is not evil the word scared is sacred for a reason because they made you scared of all the sacred symbols this symbol represents the five elements of creation if you want to advance in your life I am now doing private one-on-one consultations if you wish to talk to me let's go on a call there is no such thing a spirit you think too little of yourself oh you think you see through me do you or you don't but I see through [Music] you what did you just do to me I pushed your astral form out of your physical form open your eye you think you know how the world was you think that this material universe is all in what is real what Mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses at the root of existence mind and matter meat thoughts shape reality [Music] this universe is only one of an infinite number Worlds Without End some benevolent and [Music] lifegiving others filled with malice and hunger dark places where Powers older than depression doesn't exist it is deep rest you are resting too much your whole purpose is to create to bring thoughts into physical existence this pencil was a thought before it was physical your whole life you've been doing it but when creation is minimal in your life this is when you gain Mental Illness but you can't fix a mental illness with a physical pill because your mind is not a physical thing it a spiritual consciousness where all things originate from everything begins as thought you have to create in your life you have to be working towards something in your life you have to gain happiness you will never gain happiness sitting on your phone sitting around doing nothing this Freemason is going viral by him exposing the black Sun at the center of the earth you're probably wondering what is the black sun it's the source of all physical creation which projects the Northern Lights Earth is electromagnetic your body is electromagnetic you are a mini Earth your heart is connected to the Earth's heart the black Sun your heart is not a pump is a vortex energy generator which takes the energy of the Earth's source and turns it into plasma in the blood to run the physical body also creating your electromagnetic Aura the Northern Lights is the energy that Earth gives out to feed every living being we are all directly connected with the Earth in our hearts maybe this is why the word Earth is heart rearranged the Earth is green just like the heart chakra the sky is blue just like the throat chakra blue comes after green you are a fractal of the earth a microcosm of the macrocosm your Consciousness is heaven and your body is the Earth and space is a lie with zero evidence you never came from a monkey you are intelligently designed your life has a great meaning you're in a beautiful experience called life which is an anagram for file the body is the technology to experience this reality the soul is the true you the eye within you stay wise people devil doesn't exist in the early gospels the word devil was never found it is mentioned as a spirit of evil a Spirit of evil a spirit of evil can either be moods hate jealousy Revenge remorse and fear but the word devil means a destructive negative thought a sin is not what you think it is either the word sin comes from a Mesopotamian religion the god of the Moon the sun is masculine the Moon is feminine emotion and intellect a sin is a negative emotion because the moon represents our feminine emotions a demon is not an entity that possesses you it's a d meaning negative and man meaning moon it's a negative emotion which which possesses your mind humans possess the mind of God we can take a non-physical thought into a physical reality you possess a creative power you can either do evil which is the devil or do good which is God Jesus was teaching how to find the divine within yourself because each one of us is a spark of the Divine consciousness of the universe stop thinking with the lower mind in the lower parts of the body and raise to the higher mind where God is religion is a scam they've externalized this to make a business out of the Bible don't listen to the churches read the Bible your s you get charged in a court because you're a battery a bank is a river bank because it directs the currency money is water this is why we call it liquidity money is Mooney because the Moon is feminine it's water the sun is fire masculine this is why the tide of the ocean follow where the Moon is because it controls water in your body and on the earth that's why there's a correlation between the Moon and the stock market the moon affects our emotions and our psychology that's why we call people a Luna tick lunar is the moon if your name name is in full capital letters this is not you it's the cooperation that you subject yourself to you can't charge a natural body but you can charge a cooperation you subject yourself to the cooperation that's why you're called a corpse when you die to learn more join the universe did you know your heart is not actually a pump a heart is in the shape of a chest aedon a seven-sided shape where all the surface areas are the same when placing a chest aedon in a box it sits on an angle of 36° off center this is the same angle which the heart sits in the chest hence why it's called a chest deedon placing a chest dihedron in water creates a vortex in the water and your heart tissues is in a Vortex spiral your heart is actually one muscle but wrapped in a spiraling Vortex form this is because your heart is a vortex energy generator blood enters the heart and creates a Vortex spiral inside of the heart your heart turns water in the blood into plasma the fourth state of water which they'll never tell you about plasma makes up approximately 55% of your blood the Earth is electromagnetic the reason why heart rearranged is Earth is because the heart takes the electromagnetic energy of the earth and turns this into plasma in the blood to run the physical body your heart is directly connected to the universe to the electromagnetic energy of the Earth this is why we always see Jesus pointing at his heart your heart is inside of the chest this is where the treasure is inside of the heart your heart contains 40,000 neurons which is the exact same cells in your brain the heart is the emot IAL brain which gives you guidance it tells you what is right and what is wrong this is why we say follow your heart so much more that goes into the heart I teach everything in the new lecture in my universe Satan is Saturn 666 the mark of the beast on the North Pole of Saturn you have the cube at a PO the sides it's a six pointed star six triangles and six sides six six six the human body is made out of carbon which is six protons six electrons six neutrons your body is the Beast you are not your body the Bible even says for it is the number of a man and that number is 666 you are the Christ the intelligence within the physical body the Bible says Satan who is the God of this world has blinded the minds of those who don't believe the God of this physical world is time we live in a soul system not a solar system we started in the Stars you see the word we hit Saturn first and then incarnated through the seven planets which are the seven days of creation the seven chakras and then entered the heart which rearranged means Earth Satan blinds the mind we forget who we are and this is shown within the symbol all of the planet symbols are made out of the Sun Moon and Earth Saturn symbol is the Earth cross and the moon cresence the sun is the soul the Moon is the mind the Earth is the physical body assassin symbol is showing you matter over the moon matter over mind when it should be mind over matter it's also where the number five came from this is why we have five senses the five senses of the physical world Saturn is basically the computer running this simulation of this time Matrix you are in the game Cube of Saturn everything in this physical world has six sides up down back forward left and right Jesus cross is an unfolded Cube your Consciousness died when it came into a physical form what you're seeing here is water memory you can do this experiment yourself just by showing an image to water for around 30 seconds and then freezing the water and you will see a reflection of the image you showed it this proves that water holds memory it has Consciousness this is because water can change its structure depending on the vibrations it comes into contact with this is where things start to get a bit crazy with words placing the word schizophrenia in water and then freezing it shows this image of a double-faced person this proves that water is intelligent and is reacting to vibrations of the words now that you understand this concept what do you think happens when you are drinking Monster Energy or with cans which imprinted the word of death you are drinking crystallized water with the imprinted vibration of death you are filling 70% of your body which is water with the vibration of death tap water is mixed with sewage and also sort of toxins inside of these facilities although they may remove some of the toxins from the water the crystallized vibration of this water is still very bad ancients didn't just build beautiful water fountains for no reason they had a purpose of moving the water so that it restructures the vibration of the water water is basically the internet of the earth it has Consciousness and intelligence this is why you should never place your car keys or your phone next to your water energy codes in my bio will allow you to place codes underneath water and then drink it stop eating when the Sun is setting when you choose Chew Chew until it becomes a liquid your digestive system cannot digest chunks of food the sun Powers your digestive system and your body when you eat something when the sun is not present this is going to cause issues with your digestive system stop mixing Foods mixing animal flesh with potato and bread will cause the food to solidify within your body leading to constipation and the birth of parasites acne is undigested food coming through your skin your body's elimination methods are all blocked so it's fine way out through the skin your cells are electric your brain produces electricity it's made out of copper and carbon and you are electro magnetic human body runs of electricity it is an electrical machine you need electric food growing Under the Electric sun the sun is electric the Earth is magnetic you are the conductor of the Sun and the Earth you are electromagnetic the sun is food for your body it charges your cells electrically there's a reason why veganism rearranged is SA me and Slaughter has the word laughter in it you're a herbivore that's why your jaws swing sideways when you eat and you do not have canines to rip open flesh your hands are made to pick things not rip things open with claws all of these ancient legends were all vegan eating meat is a form of Witchcraft you are eating adrenic you are trapped within a cage the rib cage you are made out of cells a prison cell you're trapped in The Matrix which means Womb which is mass material tricks physical world is the false world it's the manif estation of the higher Dimensions everything physical began as a thought and an imagination before it manifested physically you were mental and astral before you had a physical body you died on the cross the physical body you took the Five Wounds on the cross the five sensory the mind is not the brain the brain works exactly like a computer your mind is experiencing the brain which is running the simulation of the physical world you touch taste hear and smell with your brain what you're experiencing is the nervous system and the Brain not the World your ego is the echo of your true self your ego is your mind's interpretation of your physical self the third eye is the mind and the mind can expand to Beyond physical reality The Matrix is design to keep your mind stuck in three-dimensional awareness that's why it's designed to keep you addicted to external physical things when you die your mind will still have these addictions and reincarnate the Bible's not about Jesus it's a manuscript on how you raise your Consciousness to Beyond physical reality material reality has limitation your mind does not have limitation you come here to limit your mind and learn our University tells you everything you need to know plus more plus we have a whole Li I don't want you seeing this video cuz it exposes the advanced technology we used to have the next video I'm about to show will also show you the same technology but even better and more clear I know you haven't noticed something about this piece of technology that makes it very very Advanced and stand out from all of the other videos this piece of technology has no exhaust no no Jets so how is this thing truly flying this is pure anti-gravity technology in the next video you can see how no one is overweight everyone looks healthy over 70% of people in America are obese and overweight in today's world over 80% of the foods we see in supermarkets today never existed a 100 years ago in these times one last thing before you go look at how beautiful these buildings are reflecting elegance and passion even the clothes they are wearing match the beauty of these buildings as they all dressed very formally none of these people have phones or any piece of technology in their hands they live in the present moment connecting and talking to people you are currently holding a prison within your hand your very own phone is the enslavement of your mind one of the best kept secrets of World War II is that the Allied Nations used astrology as a counter weapon against Adolf Hitler Dr John Mares internationally known astrologer and author has disclosed that he was a member of a top secret organization charged with outwitting Hitler's personal astrologer Carl Ernst craft the British war office knew that Craft's advice greatly influenced Hitler's military strategy it was the task of the psychological warfare committee to anticipate this advice by using croft's own methods of astrological charting to predict Hitler's next move Adolf Hitler was using a personal astrology to plan his Blitz Creek campaign we had to for story we had to learn all the predictions that were made to Hitler we had to come up with a counter strategy if necessary well we predicted we knew in advance what Adolf Hitler was going to get in a way of astrological advice when everybody expected Hitler to invade Britain we were convinced that he wouldn't because his Jupiter sight had run out and I know that gan's craft would never advise Hitler to expand in a non- Jupiter cycle because expansion Blitz Creek one of the best kept this is why they teach you to write with your right hand because they taught us this to activate the left hemisphere more CU of this crossover that happens in the body so when we are using this this right side more we are using that left hemisphere they also called it writing writing is a to cast a spell on you to use that right side of the body so that you use this left hemisphere because they want you to see the world as a divided perception they don't want you using the right hemisphere using that left side of the body to activate the right hemisphere to see the bigger picture and see how everything is all one and everything is created this left hemisphere keeps you from seeing the connections between everything because that left hemisphere analyzes it breaks things down so when we are left hemisphere dominated by using the right side of the body we are essentially seeing everything as divided and this is why so many people will not understand my work you are a star this is why we say Sister Mister Minister monster seven layers of Heaven the stars are on the outermost layer this is the start we are a fallen angle angel which is a fallen angle of light into a physical body Stars give everyone a unique and different characteristic without the Stars everyone would be the same you came out of the uterus the portal into the physical world you are born into a specific position of the stars and the planets which give you a specific energy in characteristic we live in an enclosed system the same 12 constellations have been going around and around since the day of creation you are in the womb for 9 months nine zodiac signs human body is made out of 12 cell Sals which are associated with the energies of the 12 constellations you are mineral deficient in three cell Sals you need to figure out what signs you're deficient in and figure out what cell Sal you are deficient in I am a Scorpio I count back nine months I am deficient in these three signs take a screenshot of this table to figure out what cell sorts you need the comment that gets zero likes wins a free book of wisdom Satan is you it's the part of your mind that wants the fame the money the status and the power that is Satan it's an aspect of your mind God is the higher mind that wants the love the intuition the wisdom the knowledge that is God demons are your emotions that possess your body your mind that's what a demon is it's all metaphorical for you the battle between your mind and your body you need to sink your mind and your body so that you can live in harmony which is heaven it's all metaphors and Until you realize this you will continue to blame the devil to Bringing negativity in your life you manifested the negativity in your life you are a result of your thoughts where you are in life is a direct manifestation of all the thoughts you thought in the past I've literally created a library for astral projection esotericism occultism and so much more that we don't know plus I'm doing lectures live calls q&as and meditations every single week inside the Ethereal University do not remove your wisdom teeth each tooth is connected to the brain and to different organs in the body your wisdom teeth are connected to your heart and your gut you must understand that every body part in your body has Consciousness and has mind of its own they remove your wisdom teeth because they don't want you connected to the heart the heart is the guiding intelligence within you most birds leave Britain to go to Africa every single year on a migration the heart is the intelligence that guides them there the heart is where true wisdom is and this is why they call them wisdom teeth because they're connected to the heart you can feel it when you do something negative because your heart is the intelligence that tells you what is right and from wrong if you do this gesture this is actually symbolizing cutting the connection between your brain and your heart Freemasons symbolize the heart as a book because you can read it to guide you through this life heart's nervous system contains 40,000 neurons which are the same neurons in the brain making decisions in the brain can be hard because it consists of a dual hemisphere the heart is a singular organ meaning it gives you the right answer the heart produces an electromagnetic field which we call a Vibe when we feel energy of someone it's produced by the emotion in the heart Christians say what happens in heaven happens on Earth what happens in the brain what you think becomes an emotion in the heart which is Earth this is why Jesus is always pointing at the Sacred Heart because this is the sacred guide through this life join the Ethereal University for deeper lectures I've
