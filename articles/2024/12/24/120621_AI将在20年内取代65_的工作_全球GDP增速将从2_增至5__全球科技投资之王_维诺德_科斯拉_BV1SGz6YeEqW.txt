Description:
*   **AI's Impact on Jobs:** AI could automate 65% of jobs within 20 years, causing significant job displacement.
*   **Future Abundance:**  AI-driven growth could lead to an era of abundance, where everyone has at least a basic standard of living.
*   **Shift in Work:** People will be able to work on things they choose, not just to survive.

**Fundamental point:** AI-driven automation will lead to a massive shift in work, potentially creating an era of abundance and allowing people to pursue their passions rather than just working to survive.

 65% of all jobs in 20 years can be done by an AI and those countries that choose to do so. So a lot of job displacement and probably a pretty disruptive period which I define in my essay. Today being a farm worker, having to work in Salinas in 100 degree heat, eight hours a day for 20, 30 years, that's not jobs. That's servitude because you need to make a living. I'm pretty certain we will have enough abundance and I postulate GDP growth will go from 2% to 5%. And that kind of growth rate, maybe not our kids, but our kids' kids, will live in that era of abundance. And we will have enough resources to support everybody at the minimum standard of living. So people work on the things they wanna work on, not the things they have to work on to support their family.
