but what is it you think that blocks people from making money the most is it mental is it an emotional thing that blocks them what holds people back from earning more or making more well I mean one of them is whatever you hate or you don't respect you're not going to get so if you don't respect rich people you're not going to be rich if you don't respect people who make a lot of money you always talk trash about them behind their back you're not going to be that person you're just not if you admire somebody that's a great executive and an earner and recreating themselves then guess what you'll eventually make that money so you know money and success is not attracted to people that talk down to them just like anything else they're not attracted to you they they want to be respected money wants to be respected not loved but money wants to be respect it it wants you to say you know what I respect what we can do with money and how much power you can bring to my family I respect it what do I need to do to get more of it
