Status: success

Description:
*   **Core Idea 1:** The speaker is intrigued by the nature of consciousness, experiencing a childhood sense of wonder about their own awareness.
*   **Core Idea 2:** Defining and testing consciousness is challenging, as a system might act consciously without truly being so.
*   **Core Idea 3:** A potential experiment involves training an AI on carefully curated, consciousness-agnostic data, then introducing the concept of consciousness to observe if the AI recognizes and articulates a similar subjective experience.
*   **Core Idea 4:** Consciousness is likely a matter of degree, with levels varying across states (e.g., tiredness) and species (e.g., primates to insects).

**Concluding Core Point:** The central exploration revolves around how to probe an AI's potential for subjective awareness by testing its ability to recognize and articulate concepts of consciousness without prior training.

**Concluding Fundamental Point:** Consciousness is likely a spectrum, and it might be possible to identify and potentially confirm it within an AI by observing unexpected yet authentic understanding.

 I mean, on the consciousness questions, like, yeah, I was as a child, I would like, you know, look into my hand and I would be like, how can it be that this is my hand that I get to see? Like, something of this nature, I don't know how to explain it much better. So that's been something I was curious about. You know, it's, it's tricky with consciousness because how do you define it? It's something that eluded definition for a long time. And how can you test it in a system? Maybe there is a system which acts perfectly right, but perfectly the way you'd expect a conscious system would act yet. Maybe it won't be conscious for some reason. I do think there is a very simple way to, there is, there is an experiment which we could run on an AI system, which we can't run on, which we can't run just yet, but maybe in like the future point when the AI learns very, very quickly from less, from less data, we could do the following experiment. Very carefully, with very carefully curated data, such that we never ever mention anything about consciousness. We would only say, you know, here is, here is a ball and here's a castle and here is a little toy. Like you would imagine, imagine you'd have data of this sort and it would be very controlled. Maybe we'd have some number of years worth of this kind of training data. Maybe it would be, maybe such an AI system would be interacting with a lot of different teachers learning from them, but well very carefully, you'll never ever mention consciousness. You don't talk about people don't talk about anything except for the most surface level notions of their experience. And then at some point you sit down this AI and you say, okay, I want to tell you about consciousness. It's the thing that's a little bit not well understood, people disagree about it, but that's how they describe it. And imagine if the AI then goes and says, oh my god, I've been feeling the same thing, but I didn't know how to articulate it. That would be okay, that would be definitely something to think about. It's like if the AI was just trained on very mundane data around objects and going from place to place or maybe, something like this from a very narrow set of concepts, we would never ever mention that. And yet if it could somehow eloquently and correctly talk about it in a way that we would recognize that would be convincing. And do you think of it as a consciousness as something of degree, or is it something more binary? I think it's something that's more a matter of degree. I think that I think that like, you know, let's say if a person is very tired, extremely tired, and maybe drunk, then perhaps if that's when someone is in that state, and maybe their consciousness is already reduced to some degree. I can imagine that animals have a more reduced form of consciousness. If you imagine going from, you know, large primates, maybe dogs, cats, and then eventually you get mice, you might get an insect. Like, feels like, I would say it's pretty continuous, yeah.
