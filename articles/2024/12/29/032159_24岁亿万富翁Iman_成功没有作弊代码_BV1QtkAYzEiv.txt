 What helps you build confidence? Doing really hard things every single day. I'm sure we've all had that one thing in our life, or maybe even a few things in our life, but where we look back and we're like, I went through that, I am so much stronger than I could ever imagine. And I think if you have enough of those experiences in your life, and if you don't live a sheltered life, and by the way, you may have grown up sheltered, but if you put yourself through the fire, then you'll really know what you're capable of. So you can say all these affirmations and all this, and both, and try to convince yourself that you're something that honestly you're not. The only way you get there is by actually forging yourself through the fire, going to the pain, going through a trauma. And that's when you'll know what you're made of.
