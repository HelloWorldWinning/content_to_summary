Status: success

Description:
The core idea is that by using GitHub search with specific keywords (like "password," "credentials," "AWS access key") in combination with a target domain, one can discover sensitive information leaked in public repositories, such as passwords, API keys, and tokens, potentially leading to unauthorized access. This technique, called "GitHub Dorking," is valuable for reconnaissance and red teaming.

The fundamental point to conclude is: **Publicly available code repositories can unintentionally leak highly sensitive information, enabling attackers to gain unauthorized access and should be analyzed for risks.**

the next thing I do and it's usually because tools like GitHub subdomains take a little bit of time to run is I start looking at an organization just using GitHub search and so that's what we're going to talk about now I call it git analysis it's right here and um I have basically created a small little uh script that I'll take my Target and give me some search links for the GitHub uh just user search and so I'll show you what that looks like right now so if I go over here I can just I have a small shell script here and it's called get dorks and I just feed it my Target so today my target is nasa.gov right and I say no here and then it'll spit out all these links and what it's doing is it's just creating some links for me that I can put into my browser and so the first one is um you have to be logged into GitHub and I can grab this link and it'll search for nasa.gov and the word password and the type code uh on GitHub search and so if I go to my browser I have that here so zoom out a little bit and I am searching for nasa.gov in quotes and password so you don't need my script to do the you can just go log into GitHub search all of GitHub for nasa.gov password and um and you'll start to see entries of source code that have uh nasa.gov somewhere in there and the word password right and so you can scroll down through a lot of this and some of it is very default it's not um it's you know it's referencing just the word password right it's not it's not a variable or it's not a you know it's not like any sensitive password right but when you start rolling through a lot of this you can start to get some interesting information so the first thing you can get from this process is legit emails of NASA uh employees right for a red teamer that's really valuable for me to have legit emails to fish these people right so you can see you know we have some people at nasa.gov here we also like I said get more information about websites that they have on the internet uh and these are not NASA owned projects these are other people writing code to interact with NASA somehow and so you can they you can see that they're interacting with this server at Nasa etc etc so I've put password in here and this is exactly what I did at uh hack spacecon and you know I was just while the tools were running I'm going through this looking for maybe any leaks that a user has done right and so right now on the first page I don't really see anything but one of my other searches is nasa.gov PWD and more often than not um pass WD is used as a reference for a password variable in code right so it's not it's not just verbatim password the word it's not P WD so if we go through here and we start looking you're going to have to blur this out but everybody's going to have to believe me we scroll down a little bit what is that right there David wow so that's a that's a bear token for a nasa.gov server um to log into one of their web applications it's in a credential file so you're going to have to and it's to an FTP there's also an FTP site referenced here that's that's theirs so we're going to blur this out but you'll have to believe me David you can see the password there correct I can see it right there yeah yeah yeah yeah so this happens because obviously this developer has um you know committed you know this file they've ever forgotten that it was you know online or they forgot that their GitHub account was public or they didn't remember they put this notation in this code or something like that or hardcoded the password they just don't know about it right it just it just happens and so this happens a lot in bug bounty hunting now GitHub has done and Microsoft who owns GitHub has done a lot of great work to to notify organizations if passwords are hardcoded in their code but uh it works not as well as I think they would like it to because this isn't an employee who's Associated to NASA's own GitHub repository this is a personal repository of like you know mine or yours right where they have interacted with NASA somehow and they have credentials and so if I keep growing down here I think there was actually a couple more that I saw let's see here here's another Bearer token same guy another search that I do in that little thing is credentials right nasa.gov and quotes and then credentials up here so here we're using another keyword so nasa.gov uh space credentials remember you got to have NASA a.gov and quotes So it it Force searches nasa.gov and then credentials and so now if we go through these um let's see if we can find anything here you know usually you have to you know really dig and so that's why I do this while my other stuff is running um so I have an opportunity to just look through some source code that's been referenced about them online um okay so tell me what this is here your off token right yep so this is a git off token so git is they apparently a source code repository and you can see that the off token is for artifactory artifactory houses uh houses artifacts or you know like libraries or pieces of code that you know I'm guessing that Nasa uses for JPL here so you can see their oo token wow and their artifactory API key so this is real stuff that happens in the real world there's a couple things like verbatim these credentials could be used it depends on if this server is an internal or external server now I'm pretty sure that this one is an external server that I'm looking at right now but it's going to be blurred to everybody but as a red teamer I would take these credentials and just verba them try to log into the servers with them and see if they were live and still working and everything like that now if they weren't working and it was a username and password I still have the user and the username and password that they disclosed in this thing and so uh in this piece of source code and so I can try that username and password on different sites of theirs if I can find out what services they use like SAS sites or other login portals for NASA because many people reuse the same password everywhere so as a red teamer I will use this information to go and try to get initial access in another place if it doesn't work verbatim on the server that's referenced in the source code so that was hacking NASA here with you in under what like a couple minutes I think like yeah and it's only because I'm asking questions and we delaying it but I mean it's like I can see how you did this in 60 seconds it's insane it's not it's not a hard concept right it's it's using you know we we did this for a long time with uh Google right Google Dorking right and um I don't know if anyone's been on the show before who does a lot of Google dking but this this is now just the new school version you should you should I'm just going to say do you want Jason to come back and do Google dking I think so Jason you should come back and do that go s I interrupted you no no worries yeah I mean um this is GitHub Dorking and so there are some automated tools to do this but I end up doing um a lot of this analysis for a source code I usually end up doing it by hand because I just want to be able to look at the code sometimes I click into these files and I really want to read them to understand what they're doing sometimes they're false positives sometimes these servers aren't online and the cred doesn't work anywhere so it's not a big deal sometimes their uh usernames and passwords for internal systems sometimes developers just put like a dummy password that actually is not like you know um a real password to the system but they wanted to put something in the variable to make it look nice so um you really have to go through and look at all these things right it's not um it's not just push you know push button receive bacon you know it's uh it's definitely something you have to analyze but yeah so there's a there's a ton of different things I look for if I go back to my script you know I look for the keyword password you have package manager Authentication um references Docker config files which can contain credentials and these are all the types of things I look for AWS access keys right is uh really important S3 config files which sometimes contain passwords HTTP password uh git credentials bash RC files SS sshd files so all of these type of files I know to contain sometimes credentials and so I will look at my target with these keywords and U I will spend a good hour to two you know sometimes three depending on how big my client is looking for these keywords on GitHub for them to to find different stuff so that's what I'm doing while all of my tools that take a long time to run are running basically big question is going to be like this script that you've that you you speaking about that you wrote is that available if I take your class or how would I get that script or yeah is just something you use internally or yeah so my script is public I mean it it's just creating these links it's nothing fancy but um it's right here um I will send you the gist link and um people can people can look at the kind of stuff I mean the the important part is this part is like what am I using what am I looking for in the search so yeah people can grab that it's it's free all this stuff is in my class my um red teaming and Bug bounty hunting class so uh if anybody wants to take it and like really dive into you know like the whole process you know that's awesome but yeah I mean because at YouTube we can only do so much right so yeah just tell us about the class again we'll just let's divert just for a for for a minute or so tell us about this class how many days um what do you do yep so my class is called The Bug Hunter methodology live it's my own thing right it's uh 15 years of my experience doing bug Bounty external pen tests red teaming all this stuff but um but it's the bug Hunters methodology live.com or t TBM live.com basically I teach two days over Discord uh live um but it's over Discord and I teach a whole bunch of stuff so um I teach all of this reconnaissance stuff that we're covering so introduction to Recon reverse who is uh like all the stuff that we're going to go over and way more um and then the second day I do application hacking and Analysis so I do things like like understanding where to hack a big application I find that like one of my favorite content creators is is RA you work with ra and um she does such an excellent job of um of explaining the vulnerabilities on some of these sites but what I find less people teach in the industry is when you're an actual tester a red teamer or someone who's doing this for a day-to-day job uh those targets that a lot of people train on you know there's a vulnerability in that page right so so that's a lot easier than when you get in the work world and you're doing this for a living and there's an application with hundreds of forms a hundred parameters a 100 Pages uh thousands of different ways to try to hack it and you get lost right and so the second day second day of my class is understanding how to approach an application um so what are the layers of the application where do you look for certain types of vulnerabilities um what tooling do you use to make this easier for yourself what questions do you ask yourself about the application um and so that's what my class is about it's less about like here's SQL injection and here's how you do SQL injection against this form because there's a million classes like that right I I don't need to teach another class like that I'm sure ra does a way better job than me but my class is about where do you look for SQL injection so um so that's kind of what my class is about and I we've got good news right Jason we've managed to twist your arm to come back and actually do the hacking because that was the number one request from the previous video right yeah so we'll do we'll do some of the hacking on uh next episode we'll finish out Recon today and um and that and then you know as always my team is available for contract if you guys are looking for red teaming uh bot.com so my red team is super legit and uh we care a lot about our clients so come check us out
