对周谷歌可以说是分头出境首先它是关宣了它的量子计算芯片叫VLo据说VLo它的五分钟的计算能力就基本上顶得上现金的世界上最快的超级计算机的10到25次方年从单纯从时间角度上来讲的话就已经超过了这个与重的年龄毕竟只有138亿年另外一件事是谷歌上述到了FTC就是联邦茂议委员会要求综织微软和OPENI之间的关于云这个方面的协议具体是什么的主要是微软它可以拖管OPENI的模型但根据他们这个协议它是一家独占只有它能够拖管OPENI的模型什么谷歌呀什么要把训论它都不行因为这个协议是一份独占的协议谷歌要求综织这个协议这个也比较好理解为什么呢因为OPENI的毕竟是代表的人工智能的最新的最尖端的研究方向可能在不久的将来就会实现AGI就是通用人工智能真的是达到了内部了的话仍然是微软一家独大的话那其实对于谷歌呀对于亚马逊这样的合级巨头来说的话它其实就是只是在在一个巨大的威胁了所以谷歌在这一座还给我们带了GEMIN A2.0GEMIN A2.0在各方面的评测上面它的表现是由于前辈GEMIN A1.5FLASH还有GEMIN A1.5FRODE它是一个多模太的模型它的书入时可以是不像智平和音频同时它的苏聪包括了图像也包括了音频它同时支持内置的它就支持歌的都所这一点也确实是挺不同反响的它自然的就和谷歌的在演网搜索就能够订可到一起了今天我们就用谷歌的AGI的Stolder体验一下GEMIN A2.0首先我们看看GEMIN A2.0的它的多模太的Live的API使用Live的API可以做什么呢在AGIStolder里面我们可以做三件事一件事情就是说跟GEMIN A2进行普通的会化第二件事情打开色上头那么让GEMIN A2.0去判断色上头里面的内容再次基础之上进一步进行会化我们还可以去把我们的屏幕共享出来让GEMIN A2去判断这共享屏幕里面的内容甚至直到你下一步做什么样的动作今天我们就找试这个吧TALK TO GEMIN A好 那我们就开始那么右边右下角的这个地方我们注意一下就是要把这个广阳令给打开这样的话就让它有的连网搜索的能力了那If the authors wanted to play我们知道你经常接我的1号你打开我的4号Dства之前的动作上面可以帮我出发那你做那些我看有十分诚实我能够说实实但是你还没说我会说实实我会说实实我会说实实我会说实实我会说实实看起来它是不能够说中文是活日语也不能够识别尽管它的输出听起来像日语但是是活也不是一个完整的日语的片段感觉它这个你要通过这个S丢掉了跟它对话的话日语和中文是我都不信可能只能英语可以我试下英语吧好那我们就换下英语talk to GermanyHi there How are you doing?HiI'm doing well Thanks for askingHow are you doing today?I'm coolKyo tell me about yourself Sure I can tell you about myselfI am a large language model trained by GoogleI am still under development but I have learned to perform many kinds of tasks including having conversationsworkout capidityI can communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions for exampleI can provide summaries of factual topics or create storiesOh by the wayWhat's your name? Today is Sunday, December 15th, 2024No, I meanWhat's your name?I don't have a nameI'm just a large language modelOkaySoKyo just tell me aboutHow could youI don't like the videoI can analyze videos by processing the visual and audio information they containI can identify objects, people and events and I can also understand spoken words and sounds in the videoWould you like me to analyze a video?No, that just a talk from saying about your capidity of searchingIntoNightOkayI can access and process information from the internet through Google SearchI can use this capability to look up facts, find relevant articles or provide up to date information on a wide range of topicsWould you like me to search the internet for something?Sure, yesCan't help meCan't just give me some information about the legal issuebetween the Google and MacroSoft about CloudDo between the MacroSoft and OpenAISure, I can help you with thatIt seems like you're asking about legal issues regarding cloud deals between Google and Microsoft and also about Microsoft and OpenAI, is that correct?YesOkay, here's a breakdown of the legal issues between these companiesGoogle versus MicrosoftAstriskIceAstriskTimeTimeTimeTimeTimeTimeTimeTimeTimeTimeTimeTime20 complaintAstriskAstriskGoogle has filed a formal antitrust complaint with the European Union against Microsoft alleging that Microsoft is abusing its market dominance in the cloud marketTimesAstriskTimesCloud LicensingAstriskAstriskGoogle claims that Microsoft's licensing terms for its Azure Cloud services restrict customers from easily using rival platforms like Google Cloud and Amazon Web ServicesThey also state that Microsoft's practices essentially lock customers into the windowGood is enough or thank you can turn Earth yourself nowOkay, is there anything else I can help you with?Nope, thank youOkay, have a great dayHello, are you still there?Yes, I am still hereIs there anything else you need? I tried it, it's pretty good It's not only good for the language, it's only for the language of support It's not supported in the day of the Chinese people In this AS6, except for the real-time communication It can also be used to create a different prompt The prompt is on the right side of the screen You can see that there are some options For example, the structure of the structure There are the function calling and the growling This growling is just in the real-time communication I said that it was a mistake If you open this growling, it will support this network operation At the same time, we can also create this place There is a save deciding Let's open it This is the reason I haven't seen it in my other language mode In this area, you can enter some internal settings Such as the adjustment of the raw material The internal flow and the image related And some dangerous internal flow In the last place, we can see a call The way of integrating I don't know what to do in this thing But from the point of view, it is just a success For example, the save deciding It can be done relatively carefully for some security raw material It can be done more carefully It means that if you have done a function It is a machine-made M2.0 model Then in the internal search scene You can decide some internal search This point is different from other major models In this sdl, there is also a start-up Here is a little use of jaminate For example, there is a map explorer You can only see the map And the analysis video For example, the space understanding For example, we choose a picture here Of course, you can send your picture And let it go to the internal section I put the image in the picture And then it starts to analyze It is divided into the picture What is the thing? It is divided And then it is divided into the result For example, here is a function of the red and the green part And the material of the image And the object It can be done after it is done This effect is indeed very good This makes me think of the GPT4 When it came out, there was a company that opened a box The mobile application process It is called BMIIS In my eyes, this application process can help the people of the image-sharing world For example, there is something in the home What content is there in the front? The content The application is also a very good The number of the GPT4 The large-scale model And the human power How to help people to live a very good life So the official is in Google In the Google ASDOT The introduction of the Gemini 2020 If you are interested in the editing, you can go through Google ASDOT Google ASDOT You can get this APYK You can get this APYK Then you can go through the process to experience I think this is a good idea It is not necessary to use it You can go through the operation of the model to make the model After that, we will talk about the price of Gemini 2020 Because it is still a test phase So its real price is not announced But before that For developers The cost of the product is 10 RPMs, 4MTPMs and 1500 requests Every day That is to say There are 10 requests every week Every week There are 400,000 tokens This is input and output Should be added together Then every day There are 115,500 requests And this is its free and free And this is its free and free
