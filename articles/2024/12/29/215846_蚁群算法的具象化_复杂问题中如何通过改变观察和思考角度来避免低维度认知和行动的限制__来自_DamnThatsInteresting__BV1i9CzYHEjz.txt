Description:
1.  **实验目的:** 比较蚂蚁和人类在迷宫中移动T形物体的能力。
2.  **实验条件:** 人类被限制沟通，模拟蚂蚁的有限沟通能力。
3.  **实验结果:**
    *   蚂蚁表现出色，策略性地移动物体。
    *   人类缺乏协调和合作，倾向于短期效率，整体效果较差。
4.  **核心结论:** 在群体解决问题方面，蚂蚁比人类表现更好。
5.  **根本结论:** 群体目标统一是高效解决问题的关键。

 Ants versus humans. Who can solve problems better? The point of this experiment is to determine whether ants or humans are better at maneuvering a T-shaped object through a maze. For this experiment, humans were prevented from communicating with each other, which replicates the limited communication abilities of ants. You can see that the ants did an excellent job at solving the problem. In fact, the experiment showed that ants are better than humans at solving this problem when working as a group. Ants moves were done strategically. Human groups, on the other hand, didn't show the same level of coordination and cooperation as ants did. Humans were going after short-term solutions that seemed efficient, but were less effective overall. This is likely because each human in the group wanted to move the object in their own way. Ants, on the other hand, acted as a single unified entity with one shared goal.
