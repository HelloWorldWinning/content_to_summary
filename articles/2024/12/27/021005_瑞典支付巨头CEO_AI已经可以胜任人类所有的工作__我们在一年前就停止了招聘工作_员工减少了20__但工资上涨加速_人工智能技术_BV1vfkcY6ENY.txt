 of the opinion that AI can already do all of the jobs that we as humans do. It's just a question of how we apply it and use it. We stopped hiring about a year ago, so we were 4,500, now we're 3,500. We have a natural attrition as every type of company, and by not hiring we're simply shrinking, right?

So we're going to give some of the improvements that the efficiency that AI provides by increasing the pace of which the salaries of our employees increases. And that's because of that message being very consistent for myself and management for the last year. People in Connaclana are just rallying to employ as much efficiency as they can, because it just means it has direct implications on their equity and their cash compensation for working with them.
