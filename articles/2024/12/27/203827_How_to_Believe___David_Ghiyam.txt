how does someone start to believe something is possible when they've never created it for themselves people think that it's very difficult to GA and it's actually much easier your body is and your mind and your soul very compliant if you say something over and over again and it's so simple I don't want to over complicate spirituality if you say something a mantra over and over again even if you're faking it in the beginning your body your mind and your soul will comply with that vibration and then you will do actions that will be closer to that vibration and they will re Force each other so what I do literally every day is I just ask myself what is the highest vibration I need to get to I see the Delta of where I'm at now and where I need to get to and I just keep hitting that point over and over and over again incessantly until all of me complies with it
