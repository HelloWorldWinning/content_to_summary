Description:
Here's the summary:

*   **Core Idea:** Sex, when separated from procreation, is fundamentally absurd and driven solely by the pursuit of pleasure, which activates the limbic system.
*   **Fundamental Point:** Sex for pleasure, without procreation as a purpose, is a nonsensical activity driven by brain chemistry.


Content:
 A truly stupidity about thinking has gone into sex. Without purpose, without procreation, which is actually quite a silly action in the absence of procreation. It's vitally. Why you doing it? Because it makes the limit system happy, that's why. That's why. But it's pretty absurd, really. But I mean, this is a lot of computation has gone into how can I do more of that with procreation not even being a factor?
