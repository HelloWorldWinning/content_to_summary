Google google.com and you sign into your account and then you're going to come up to this button right here which is settings and you just going to click cancel membership okay and that's as simple as it is but you do this get all of your research done on these pillar Pages first before the month is out so you've got a Year's worth of content on pillar pages okay and on the subtopics for them so with that said let's get in to start creating these so this is what Google Gemini deep research actually looks like inside as you can see I've already run a bit of research here first so it goes through lots and lots of different research and it's found lots of different things related to a topic that I'm actually writing a pillar post about now I'm going to go through and I'm going to show you how to actually utilize this now but as you can see it's huge amount of research in here broken down so that you can use this in your own pillar pages and at the bottom here what you're going to see is you're going to see a lot of websites that it's actually gone and researched these websites for that information for think of Google Gemini deep research almost like your own personal research assistant somebody that you're hiring to go and spend hours to go and find this information for you but instead of them spending hours Google does this in minutes like actual minutes it does all of This research for you so let's go and get started once you've signed up for Google Gemini you're going to come over to here and you'll be in Gemini Advance most likely or you be in 1.5 Pro or something like that you're going to come over to here and you're just going to type in or you're going to come to here and you're going to type Google pro with deep research okay now this is where we got a prompt it in the correct way now before we prompt it we got to think about the type of research that we wanted to actually create so a pillar page in itself is almost like it's like the the broad topic that you're trying to cover within one of the main areas of your website so for me it would be about using how to use AI agents for affiliate marketing okay so that is the broad topic that I would create lots of other pieces of content under their need Okay so then I would kind of like to use tools for AI agents then I'd be kind of like as I said predictive analysis for AI agents so we've got to think about those big topics all right so they're the ones that we want to get Google to research for us then we got to prompt it with the proper prompt okay so we're going to just type in something like this okay so research how a gentic AI impacts affiliate marketing strategies so we're just going to ask it to research it okay so research how did what your main topic is going to be about and then we're just going to click go and what you're going to notice now is it's going to come back very quickly with a little bit of information about what it's going to do okay so we can click on more it's going to tell us okay so agentic Ai and affil affiliate marketing research how agentic AI impacts affiliate marketing strategies by 1 2 3 4 5 and six then it's going to analyze results it's going to create a report and it's going to be ready in a few minutes but we can also edit that plan okay so we can go through and we can say okay so look it says edit the research this is the current plan what changes do you want to make okay so if we wanted to make any changes we could do it in here we say look at it's okay actually actually this is okay let's go all right and so what it's basically going to do is it's going to start the research process now this is going to take a couple couple of minutes to do but already you can see it it's starting to come and it's starting to research the top websites now just think about it for you to do this yourself or for you to hire somebody to do it this is going to take hours and hours and hours to do so we're going to give it a few minutes and then we're going to come back and see what it's actually created for us so here's what it's come up with this took about five minutes okay but what it did do was it researched 36 websites the top websites on the topic that I had actually asked it to research and what it's done is as you can see here it's made a huge big document about all of the latest research with examples of AI in marketing personalization advertising all those kind of different things the part that I love about this here is this up here in the corner you can see open in Google Docs now what it's going to do here down here you can see in the left hand corner it's saying new document okay so new document created now we're going to open it in Google Docs itself now that basically means that you get to keep that research that is your research now that is an awesome piece of research now a lot of people might tell you hey look at that's okay just leave it at that and change a few bits and then publish that you don't want to do that okay you want to turn this into a proper pillar article so the first thing that you want to do is you want to go through it and you want to actually want to read it and then you're going to want to extract certain points from there okay you're going to want to I don't mean like extract like just take them out of it and kind of don't use the rest of the research I want you to go through it and if there are any stats that really jump out at you you know then basically what you're going to do let's say that was a stat right there you're going to highlight that stat and then that's going to become something for you that maybe you highlight in your article when it's created but we want to take this a step further okay we want to utilize Google deep research to actually ask it how are we going to create this type of pillar page for us okay with this research and so what we're going to do is we're going to come back over to Google Gemini and we're just going to put in a simple prompt like this okay I would like to create a pillar page for This research can you outline the perfect pillar page structure that takes on board all the relevant information that is needed to rank online in Google and again Google is going to go off so here we go here's what we have to effectively structure a pillar page about a gentic ai's impact on affiliate marketing and ensure it ranks well on Google consider this outline choose a clear concise and keyword Rich title then it goes and gives us them then our introduction okay start with a brief hook reader attention Etc then what is agentic AI what is affiliate marketing then it goes into case studies and examples show real world case studies then we bring this it goes into future of agentic AI in affiliate marketing and we bring all this information together okay we bring it together into our pillar page so we go and we put this information that we've got from here and we also use the structure so basically use this structure and this research to create the perfect pillar page for our website okay and that's where we go through and we're actually creating content that Google is telling us that it absolutely loves now here's what I am going to say about artificial intelligence Google deep research Claude uh chat GPT all of the they can be lazy okay so don't expect it to spit out something that is ready for you to just copy paste and and ship up onto your website that's not how it works so Gemini is just given you the output you can go through step at a time and say okay so here's the title okay how about we go through the introduction how about we ask Google Gemini or chat GPT based on This research to write this introduction utilizing these points here that's where we make pillar content that absolutely rocks and then you're going to put it up onto your blog or whatever it is so guys that's how you create awesome pillar content utilizing Google Gemini for free a
