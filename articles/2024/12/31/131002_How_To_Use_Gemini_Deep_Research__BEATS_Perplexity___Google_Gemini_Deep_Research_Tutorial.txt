in this online tutorial I'm going to be showing you guys exactly how to use Google's new Gemini Advanced 1.5 Pro deep research this online tool is absolutely gamechanging for anyone that uses the internet on a day-to-day basis think of it like perplexity but on steroids so without wasting any more time let's get into what makes this tool actually amazing so in order to activate this you're going to want to go to the top left hand side then hit the drop- down menu and ensure you are on 1.5 Pro with deep research so now you can see that this is activated it's not any of the other models you are ready to go now this is completely crazy because you're able to get a vast amount of information summarized into a complete document so what you first want to do is figure out exactly what it is that you want firstly what I'll do is I'll use one of the example documents and then we'll go to something more specific so for example what I can do is I can look at this and I can use this and you can see I've input a very very B basic prompt it says help me research autonomous Vehicle Center trends for my robotics essay now what Google will do now is it will now build a step-by-step plan in order to achieve this goal more effectively you can see right here it's giving me six steps six complete steps and from those six steps it's going to gather data around the web now this is an important step because here things can kind of mess up but this is where you want to double check the plan you can see it's going to find research papers it's then going to find the different different kinds of you know sensors it's then going to find the current information on current trends and it's going to find the challenges and limitations lastly it's going to find all the information on autonomous vehicle sensor technology and then it's going to analyze the results then it's going to create a report and I just need to sit back and wait in a few minutes now what you can do here if you don't like this plan you can click edit plan and you can maybe change something so let's say for example you wanted it to research Reddit for any machine learning engineers that have worked on this kind of thing maybe you could ask it to do that so you just simply say search Reddit 2 for up toate industry insights and then now once I've edited this plan you're going to see that it adjusts the plan according to my research goals it'll take just a second and then now you can see the sixth step right there it says look on Reddit for Relevant threads on autonomous Vehicle Center Technology now you can see it's going to do that and I'm going to be able to get that report so now I click Start research this is where the magic happens so right now your agents I'm not sure if it's one or if it's multiple but I'm guessing that it is probably multiple agents are scouring the internet on your behalf looking around to see if they can find anything useful you can see right now it's browsing through 48 websites looking for information that is useful to you now you'll know how far this is done via this right here you can see that there is an icon that is like a circle icon and it's slowly filling up up with purple in terms of the color there and once that is entirely purple you'll see that your research report is done now of course during this time if you want you could go ahead and click over to these websites but I wouldn't recommend that I just recommend going to another tab or simply doing something else so you simply wait you can see right there we're nearly halfway there and in a moment I'm going to show you guys exactly what I've managed to do and also you can see that this agent is actually doing everything correctly because the last step it is actually going to Reddit so we know that the instructions are are rather effective and the reason that this is so crazy is because you don't have to spend hours and hours browsing on Reddit to find something anymore this is going to be something that gives you all the information that you need so here we are after several minutes you can see that the research request has been completed and now we get a completely comprehensive report of everything that is going on in the autonomous vehicle sensor research base now I'm not an expert on autonomous vehicle sensor research so for those of you out there at are you know you're going to have to double check this but I think the main thing that this is showing us is just how effective this tool can be I mean when we take a look at what it's able to do it's able to give us a table and anytime it manages to say something so for example it talks about IUS you can actually go ahead and look at the source to where that has come from so you can click learn more and you can see exactly where that Source has come from so with every paragraph there is a cited Source you can see all three websites here here so if anything confuses you you can double check this verify it and make sure that your model is not hallucinating because sometimes we find pieces of information and we genuinely can't believe they are true now this is something that I am going to incorporate into my daily workflow I have a ton of research that I do onto a day-to-day basis and this is something that's going to help me save a tremendous amount of time now of course with this what you can also do is you can of course open this in Google Docs and now it essentially is going to create a document with all of this information which you can do many different things with for example if we open this in Google Docs you can see right here we have the entire document that is around nine pages long and at the end you can see all of these Works being cited now of course like I said before if you're in the Gemini workspace era you can hit this button and you can talk with this document even more gaining a lot more insights alternatively you could turn to notebook LM and of course ask them to make a podcast C about this and of course understand all of this kind of information because whilst nine pages of research is quite good the idea for this kind of tool is to save you time so of course searching through nine pages of information might not be the best thing to do you can just simply ask it questions about the content here or if we even went back to Gemini you could simply ask it questions about this stuff right in the chat B here so there's many ways for you to do this now I was completely blown away by this technology and I wanted to show you guys some real world use cases for this stuff so most of you guys don't know this but I'm someone that I would call an avid investor I'm always looking for the different ways that you could potentially find that next stock that is going to Triple within the coming years and it's always possible you just have to do a ton of research now I thought to myself what would be the best way to utilize Gemini Pros Advanced research abilities and that's when I decided to create a super specific prompt that allows me to get all of the data that I need whilst maintaining speed and accuracy so I actually spent the last several hours creating some really specific prompts that I could utilize them for this I've actually got an entire prompt Library here for my community so if you are in my community this is something that you can access but down here I'm going to show you guys one of them and this is just too good not to share this is my investment research Automation and this is basically a prompt that allows me to use this AI tool to get research insights really really quickly so you can see here it says create a comprehensive stock analysis report focusing on the top 10 stocks showing unusual positive mentions companies with significant patent activity and emerging Technologies stock with strong institutional buying patterns and correlation between social media sentiment and price movement also take a look at inside of trading patterns and institutional ownership changes and present these findings in a detailed Report with growth probability scores for 2025 Now using my prompt Library I can simply take this and trust me there are tons more that I made earlier like I said you guys can join my community there's a lot of resources there but when I put this prompt in I got a completely comprehensive guide that shows me the top 10 stocks with unusual positive mention patterns I also got stocks with strong institutional buying patterns I got correlations between certain stocks sentiment and the price movement I also got insider trading patterns and institutional ownership changes you can see it also gave me a breakdown on growth probability scores for 2025 and the document just goes on and on so this is something that like I said before I'm going to be using every single day and this is not just something for you know stocks you can utilize it in a vast array of different ways and this is something that I spent so long prompt engineering and I think I've managed to figure it out as always you can change your plan if you wish you can instruct it to go to a certain website then do something else and honestly this AI tool is just absolutely incredible and I can't believe we didn't have access to this before and of course if you want access to my Google deep research prompt Library don't forget to check out the community it's just there in the prompt section and it is really useful because trust me one thing that you don't want to do is you don't want to use the wrong prompt cuz sometimes Gemini can misunderstand it just make sure you keep your prompt simple straight to the point and you're clear on exactly what outcome you do want let me know if you guys are going to be using this tool I for certainly I'm going to be using this every single day and if there's anything else that I missed don't forget to leave a comment down below so that other individuals can benefit from that too
