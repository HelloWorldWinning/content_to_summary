 You know, this isn't a job, this is my life's work. And the idea, the way of thinking about what do you do as your life's work rather than your job, I think it is a very big difference in your mind. And maybe you're a carpenter, maybe you're an artist, maybe you're a neurosurgeon. You consider it to be your life's work. This is what I'm going to dedicate my life to perfect a craft of. And so, and videos of my life's work, I learned a lot along the way. There are a lot of things that, and so I'm not going to share with you. I'm not going to spend any time talking about those things. You've got lots to learn. If you want to be CEO of a company, you have lots to learn. You have to reinvent yourself constantly. The world is changing all the time. Your company is changing all the time. Technology is changing all the time. Everything that you know today will be useful someday, but it won't be enough, not even nearly enough. And so I spend, I spend basically every single day learning. As I was flying over here, I was watching YouTube's or I was talking to my AI. By the way, get an AI as a tutor, asking that lots of questions. And it tells me an answer. And I ask, why did you give me that answer? Tell me the answer step by step. Explain it to me in this way. Apply this reasoning to something else. Give me some analogies. There's a lot of different ways to learn. And I use my AI. And I torture my AI to teach me. And so there are a lot of ways to learn, but my point is you're constantly learning.
