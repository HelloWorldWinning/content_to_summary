Have you ever felt lost trying to come up 
with the perfect prompt for ChatGPT? Well,   not any longer! In this video, I will show 
you a prompt engineering app that you can use   on top of your InfraNodus in order to visualize 
your conversation as a graph see the main ideas   inside how they related to one another but most 
importantly identify the gaps so the topics that   you're not yet connecting and then use those gaps 
to generate interesting research questions that   can lead you to new ideas so if you're interested 
keep watching and I will demonstrate how it works   also a little bit about myself I'm Dmitry I'm the 
developer of this app it's called InfraNodus I've   been working in the field of AI for the last 
several years and I like using different tools   and sharing my insights so if you like this video 
please also subscribe so that it gets recommended   to other people interested in the same stuff so 
let's jump right in. Here I have a conversation   that I was having with my Chat GPT it was about 
ecological thinking and at some point after a   few responses I reach a limit I don't know what 
else I should ask it so there what I can do is   to open the InfraNodus extension here and what 
InfraNodus extension does is that it visualizes   the conversation I'm having here as a graph 
where the words in the conversation are the   nodes and the cooccurrences are the connections 
between them so that I can quickly see what are   the main terms used in this conversation so I see 
that there's a strong relation between ecological   thinking and by the way it highlights relations 
not only words so that's why it's very useful I   also see that there's U something on social impact 
systems and also sustainable practices and that   gives me like a good overview and a reminder of 
what this conversation was about now let's say I   want to develop it further the most effective way 
is to go into the gaps here and what infus does is   that it identifies the topics that are not yet 
well connected that I didn't talk about in the   same context in this particular conversation and 
I can reload a few of them and for example find   something that I find interesting in this case 
I like this gap between impact assess and carbon   neutrality and then I can use the built-in AI to 
generate a question for this Gap that will bridge   this Gap so here it says how can integrated policy 
Frameworks be developed to assess and enhance the   positive contributions of local materials in 
achieving carbon neutrality while promoting   social and economic growth in communities that's 
quite an interesting question it combines both   ecological thinking and social policies maybe 
even politics a little bit so what I can do I   can copy this question and then I can paste it 
to chpt I can make this window smaller and paste   it to chpt and then what's going to happen is 
that Char PT obviously will try to answer this   question and develop the conversation further and 
once it answers this question this graph here is   going to be reloaded it will take into account the 
answer of CH PT what it just produced recalculate   everything and help me identify the new gaps 
in the conversation the new relations new ideas   and so on so let's see how that happens so here 
it generates an answer as soon as it's finished   the graph is regenerated and now I can see a new 
Gap in the in the conversation that I can bridge   if I want I can reload it and usually I like to 
find gaps that are really further from each other   as possible as far from each other as possible so 
for example here carbon Innovation and sustainable   practices it means that chadt is talking about 
those topics but not really connecting them   together so I'm going to ask it to generate 
another question based on this Gap and here   it takes uh those two topics and tries to come up 
with a new question it says here how can companies   integrate Innovative practices to establish 
measurable sustainability goals that align with   carbon neutrality targets thereby promoting 
long-term growth and ethical standards in   development so you see here it's talking about how 
corporations can adopt those practices and it's   probably because it talked about it but not in the 
same context I can this question again and then   it's going to come up with a new answer so that's 
how it works you can also use it on a completely   new conversation so let's say I just want to 
start directly from zero so I'm just going to   start with an empty conversation here as you can 
see it just visualizes what I have so I don't need   it right now and I'm going to try to talk about. 
Let's say I want to develop a new app for Chat   GPT prompt engineering and I'm going to open the 
extension now so that as soon as ChatGPT answers   it's it's going to visualize the result so you 
see here it's providing me some ideas about how   I can launch it and it's quite verbose and here 
I don't need to read the answer of chipt that's   why I like it also because sometimes it gives 
you this really long answers and maybe you just   want to kind of start brainstorming so you don't 
need to read through everything but rather you   can look into the main ideas so for example here 
obviously app is a big idea and actually let me   remove this for because this is not so important 
for us I'm just going to click on concepts here,   select app and I'm going to hide it from the graph 
so that I can see the context around it and then   I'm going to go to the gaps and ask it to identify 
a gap so for example prompt engineering native   development that's interesting let's see what 
it's about so I'm going to generate a question   based on that and here it says how can the mobile 
app leveraging chadt prompt engineering optimize   user experience through tailored templates while 
ensuring Swift integration with Frameworks like   react native and flatter so basically here it's 
proposing me okay you could make an app for prompt   engineering for mobile that would have some kind 
of templates but you also need to make it in a way   that it would work on different devices on iPhone 
for example and on Android and these are the two   Frameworks that would work on both so so that can 
be an interesting question I can paste it here and   then go into the technical aspects of developing 
this app on the other hand I can of course also   decide okay I don't actually just want to focus 
on the technical aspects maybe I want to focus   more on how this app should actually work right 
so what I can do also is is that I can ask this   question from inside INF foren notus itself in 
fact so I can let me get this word app in back   in the app and then I go into chat and here it's 
telling me that it's going to use the context in   fact that I have in this conversation so I'm 
going to go to explore let me just deselect   everything and reload it once again because 
sometimes it needs to be reloaded to have the   whole conversation in in its memory right and 
then I go to Chat GPT here so it has like its   own chat it's a chat and then I'm going to go here 
and I'm going to check if the context as the whole   graph so I'm going to click here and as you can 
see I have all the topics of the conversation as   the context of this chat and then I'm going to 
say what could be this app about how would it   work specifically and be helpful to users so I'm 
going to ask this question it's going to use the   context of the graph to generate an answer and 
here it says the app would focus on optimizing   prompt engineering for users offering customized 
temp templates and AB testing features it would   provide real-time feedback to refine prompts and 
enhance user engagement while integrating smoothly   with Frameworks like react native and flatter so 
here I have a summary of this conversation which   is great I can paste it here and then develop this 
conversation further or what I can also do is once   I have this conversation and I have the main 
topics identified I can look at these topics I   can extend this window and kind of look at them in 
detail and for example focus on something specific   like for instance here analytic performance and I 
can ask the system okay let's go in the chat and   let's clear this conversation check the context 
it's only this topic so and then I will ask it   how I can develop it further so here it's just 
going to talk in relation to this topic that I   selected which is great you see here it says to 
further develop your app consider integrating   Advanced analytic tools to track user behavior 
and template usage this will help you ident   y gaps for improvement while ensuring an 
effective collaboration experience so here   it's great because I don't have to take the whole 
conversation I can just focus on certain aspects   that I find interesting kind of like building 
blocks and then send them back to the built-in   chat or use them to generate interesting questions 
for my Chat GPT so I can also just select this   topic here and then generate a question and then 
it's going to generate a question right based on   this cluster which I selected right so I'm going 
to click this here it's talking about cloud based   platforms and how they can be used and then I'm 
kind of making Chat GPT think further focusing   on that very topic that I selected so this is 
another really great feature of it is that you   can actually use the graph to focus on specific 
aspects of the conversation which which can be   pretty useful and interesting especially if you 
kind of have like a really long conversation and   you don't want to talk about all the different 
aspects but you only want to focus on some   you can even zoom in and select some specific 
topics like words so for example machine Let's   see machine what else is connected to machine 
learning so let's say machine learning models   that's interesting so it's a bit more technical 
let's select this path and then we will try to   generate a question based on this very path of 
machine learning and here it's it's saying how   can a mobile app for Char T prompt engineering 
integrate machine learning analysis with user   feedback metrics to optimize template variations 
and enhance real-time user engagement great so   here it's telling me okay you could actually 
analyze user Behavior Uh how they're using prompts   in this mobile app and then generate some more 
tools based on that so I'm going to paste this   question into Chat GPT so I selected something 
I find interesting from the whole conversation   without having to read through the whole thing 
and then I asked it to generate me this idea   and here it's providing me the answer to my 
question so let me just show you here I had a   question I believe yeah here how can a mobile app 
for CHT so and here it's giving me the whole kind   of almost like an article or a comprehensive 
guide so it's giving me an architecture and   workflow data collection and storage and so on so 
you see here it's pretty interesting because it   already gave me a whole procedure on how I could 
actually develop this app and this just happened   in a few minutes as you can see so it's pretty 
amazing as I say you can use this graph just   to focus on gaps so if you don't want to use the 
graph you can just go into gaps generate some gaps   and then use the inside question feature or what 
you can also do is to select everything and focus   on specific topics like I did here data analysis 
content optimization Cloud performance and so on   or you can also select specific Concepts that you 
find interesting like here templates and prompts   and here it shows you which connections are more 
relevant and prominent so that can be interesting   for you because maybe you want to combine them but 
you can also combine things that are not connected   so for example templates and prompts and let's say 
something that it's not connected to maybe Google   for example and data you know so you can really 
create your own paths and the graph and then based   on those paths generate interesting questions for 
Chat GPT or even ideas and summaries as well so   try it out it's available on InfraNodus.Com if 
you go here into InfraNodus and then you go to   the extension so it's in the info section and then 
you need to click on AI browser extension and you   can download it for Chrome or for Firefox and then 
just activate it and use it on top of Chat GPT try   it out and if you have any questions or comments 
let me know and I'll be happy to help thank you
