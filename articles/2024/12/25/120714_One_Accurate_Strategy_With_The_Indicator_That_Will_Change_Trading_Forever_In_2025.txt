I'm about to show you a secret trading indicator that has completely blown me away it delivers buy and cell signals with unbelievable Precision unlike anything I've ever seen before and the results absolutely mindblowing you serious the best part it works across Forex stocks and crypto and also in any time frame you might be trading ranging from 5 minute to 4 hours this could be a game changer you've been looking for so make sure you watch till the end because I promise you don't want to miss this without any waste of time let's get a straight to it to kick things off as always go to tradingview.com the best platform to analyze any market and spot trading opportunities once you're there head over to the indicators Tab and type in Colman Hall super Trend now this is not a mere indicator and I'm going to show you why this is probably the best indicator in the game collect on that and it will appear on your chart in a default form which needs some major modifications in order to get the best out of it so go to the settings in inputs set measurement noise to tan this is the value I've seen work best in most of the markets in Styles unck bar color because that's something unnecessary for our strategy hit okay and this is the indicator we're going to use I'm here to tell you right now we don't care the Colman is actually a trend follow following indicator which gives signals based on a momentum shift so its coding gives a bit more Precision to it it is completely easy to interpret with L signal meaning long and S meaning short so let's try some signals on bitcoin 1 hour time frame we have the first s signal or short signal implying Market has shifted momentum from bullish to bearish and it has obviously worked out given a decent risk reward ratio the next signal is actually long signal identified by the letter L this signal also gave a minimum profit the next one is an S which is a short and the candles moved in the direction of the signal this also takes us to our next trade which is an L or long signal like most of the indicators out there there are some downsides to it like in any other indicator you might encounter some false signals but the good thing is these false signals are generally proceeded by a correct signal which in this case is a long signal so this indicator stands out for a reason its ability to consistently deliver accurate signals far overweighing the occasional false signals it's a complete Rarity in the market and a tool we should pay serious attention to so these false signals can be really annoying and they need to be eliminated the most practical way is to use anod indicator come on now dog come on man so go back to the indicators Tab and type in on the chimoko cloud it will appear on your chart in a default form for some modifications and a Styles uncheck everything except for plot background which is the collot itself that's all theu is nothing short of magical when it comes to analyzing an asset's future movement it is one of the most powerful tools out there offering clear confirmations to make confident trade decisions ich chimoko cloud or Kumo at any point is a strong support or a resistance you'd see candles would react to this cloud and continue in the main Trend Direction however if this support and resistance is penetrated then it implies Market is turning to go in the opposite direction and there was a huge momentum shift this is the quality we can use with any strategy we're trading with since it's a solid and strong reversal confirmation so let's just combine both the indicators and see how it works for a long position you need a super Trend L letter meaning a long signal then we need an ichimoku breakout finally a future clot must be green implying a future bullish movement all these three signals combined indicate there is a more momentum shift from bearish to bullish now we can be pretty confident this long signal is actually valid I start a long because the breakout candle has a big body I choose the securest spot to set a tide stop loss and I go for a rest reward ratio of two or three for a short position the same steps are applied first off we need an S signal which indicates a short position opportunity along with the Kumo breakout which is an important reversal signal and also the future clot is red indicating future bearish movement good thing about this particular trade is that price action also confirms the trend reversal with a pullback to the clot which is ended by a weak candle now we got four confirmations for a short position this indicator is super flexible you can mix it with price action for some solid results but if you're looking for something simpler just try pairing it with another strong indicator instead of aimoku so go back to the indicators Tab and type in SSL hybrid which is one of my own favorite indicators for some modifications in a Styles follow my exact steps in inputs set ssl1 Baseline type to kij version 2 and its lengths to 108 SSL hybrid is a strong indicator which is easily understood and applied on different charts in different time frames just like ichimoku Cloud it acts as a strong support and resistance level and is may be much stronger so when candles penetrate this line it implies Market has shifted momentum so this quality again could be used to eliminate super Trends false signals because a breakout from a strong support and resistance level gives much more confident trades with any strategy so let's combine both the indicators to get a final strategy but before if you think you learn something new just don't forget to hit the like button it really makes me happy knowing my free content is making a difference in order to take a short position we need one Ru only take short when candles are below the red SSL so this s signal is associated with a candle that has already penetrated the SSL hybrid these two happening at the same time along with the pull back gives a strong cell signal with all this being said if there is a long signal below the SSL then we can be pretty confident it is a false signal now these signals are completely eliminated using the SSL hybrid however if there is a short signal below the SSL there is a high probability of a downward movement in other words it is a continuation signal this takes us to the long position criteria only take long when candles are above the blue SSL in this example there is a super Trend long signal along with SSL breakout which confirms the original prediction so this example ends the lesson but
