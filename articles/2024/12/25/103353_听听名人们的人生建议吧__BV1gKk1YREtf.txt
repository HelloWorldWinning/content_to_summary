 What is the best advice you've ever had or received? Throw date, baby. There's blessing in the breaking. To turn your nerves into excitement. Just please say as it is, just don't give up. The world won't always like you, but you can't count on the world to like you. If you're unsure about something, take a moment. Really be present and make the most of your relationships, because we're not here very long.
