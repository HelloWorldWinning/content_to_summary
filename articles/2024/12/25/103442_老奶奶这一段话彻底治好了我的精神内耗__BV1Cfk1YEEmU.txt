 Just let them. If they want to choose something or someone over you, let them. If they want to go weeks without talking to you, let them. If they are okay with never seeing you, let them. If they are okay with always putting themselves first, let them. If they are showing you who they are and not what you perceived them to be, let them. If they want to follow the crowd, let them. If they want to judge or misunderstand you, let them. If they act like they can live without you, let them. If they want to walk out of your life and leave, hold the door open and let them. Let them lose you. You were never theirs because you were always your own. So let them. Let them show you who they truly are, not tell you. Let them prove how worthy they are of your time. Let them make the necessary steps to be a part of your life. Let them earn your forgiveness. Let them call you to talk about ordinary things. Let them take you out on the Thursday. Let them talk about anything and everything, just because it's you they are talking to. Let them have a safe place in you. Let them see the heart in you that didn't harden. Let them love you. You have to accept yourself just as you are without having to make changes to others. If you feel that you have to change to maintain a relationship, if that change is always what I did, then the relationship might need to be given some consideration and do not automatically take the blame and punish yourself for any of the things that they have done. Some of us find that part to do. On occasion you might be tempted to heal a rift, but they have to earn a place back in your life. Otherwise it will be very quickly back to as was same old. You need to be shown respect and that your needs, your wishes, you are considered. They don't value you and you deserve to be valued and to be made to feel valued. Let's face it it's a form of control. Don't let them control you. You are the only one who has control of you unless you give that control away. Never forget that. You belong to nobody but yourself. Establish those boundaries. Establishing them is one thing. Keeping them is another. Have a big conversation with yourself about where those boundaries need to be. And if there would be any opportunity that you might feel you would allow those boundaries to fall. But put yourself your considerations top of the pile. Establish. It really isn't. There are many people think it is. It's self-caring, self-nurturing. And by if those others aren't doing it, you must be really must. On that note I will say thank you very much for joining me. And take care of you no matter what the world, no matter what other people. Be they can invert it, come as friends or family, work colleagues, whatever. Think of you. Thank you for joining me. Bye for now. Bye. Bye.
