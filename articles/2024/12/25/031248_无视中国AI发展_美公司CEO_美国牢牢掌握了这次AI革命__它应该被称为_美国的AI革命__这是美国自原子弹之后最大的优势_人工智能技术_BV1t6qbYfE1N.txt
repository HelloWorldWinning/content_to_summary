 America is in the very beginning of a revolution that we own the AI revolution and we own it. It should basically be called the US AI revolution. Every single relevant company in the world is in this country. The seconds here of those companies are in this country. The JV of these companies are in this country. There is no other place to do technology really at scale besides America right now. The American tech community is booming and if you have the right way to implement them, you can actually transform your business in days. It's happening across America and it's not happening anywhere else. It's not happening in Europe. No one wants to go to a company in China or Russia. It's happening right here and that macro trend is going to change everything that we do. And this is actually maybe the first time since we had the bomb and our adversaries before they stole it from us. Where we have a massive structural advantage.
