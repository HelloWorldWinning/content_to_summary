Description:
*   **Identity Crisis:** The speaker expresses a deep sense of not being a "real man," possibly linked to feelings of powerlessness.
*   **Syrian Discontent:** The speaker critiques external interference in Syria, stating that it resulted in the nation's destruction, comparable to Libya and Iraq.
*   **Anti-Intervention:** The speaker condemns those cheering for Assad's removal, accusing them of celebrating national destruction and having no understanding of consequences.
*  **The West is NOT a friend:**  The speaker makes a strong statement that the West is not an ally to the country in question.
*   **Abandoned & Destined for Conflict:** The speaker predicts further despair, civil war, and abandonment of the nation due to external intervention.

Ultimately, the core message is that external interference, despite its stated goals, leads to national destruction and leaves its people in despair, with no real allies in sight.

 I'm not a real man. Get out of me! Get out of me! I'm not a real man! I'm not a real man! I'm not a real man! If you're not Syrian and you're coming on the internet to shame Syrians, you're out of your mind. And you need to leave. Bashar al-Assad may not have been perfect. Maybe he needed to go. But if you're cheering right now, you're cheering for the wrong thing. Because your nation is gone. It's finished. It's gone the way of Libya. It's gone the way of Iraq. Disfunction states, populated people that don't get lost. Assad needs to go. It's time for Assad to get out of the way. There was no money in Damascus to pay troops. People were exhausted. There had not been a... America has all of Syria's. Most of Syria's oil and gas. I'm not a real man. I thought you were going to take a look at the sun. When will it be? It's a dream. I'm not a real man. Or I'm a real man who can be the best. When the sun rises and the sun rises, when the sun rises, when this light comes out, when the sun rises, when the sun rises, when the sun rises, when the sun rises, when the sun rises. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. Or I'm a real man. Or I'm a real man. I'm not a real man. Or I'm not a real man. Or I'm not a real man. Or I'm not a real man. The people of Libya have a leader from a market offer with the West-Hadeh. And we got rid of them. But the Libya today. The people in Iraq had a leader to stop their saying that the West hated it. We got rid of them. We're going to Iraq today. The people of Syria are cheering in the streets right now. I spit on you. I'll tell you why. Because you don't know what you're cheering for. You cannot cheer the death of the nation. And that's just what happened. Your nation is dead. And the West is not your friend. You have no friends. Nobody likes you. Nobody wants to be with you. Nobody will support you. You will be abandoned by everybody as death and despair and destruction manifests itself further in your nation. And now you'll have civil war, civil conflict, death and destruction. That's what you got.
