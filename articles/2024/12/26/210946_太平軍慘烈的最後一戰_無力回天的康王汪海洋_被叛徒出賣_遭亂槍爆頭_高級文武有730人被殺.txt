*   **Li Shixian's Rise and Fall:**  Li Shixian, a prominent general with significant forces, initially thrived, but strategic disagreements and internal conflicts led to his demise at the hands of Wang Haiyang.
*   **Wang Haiyang's Treachery:** Driven by ambition and paranoia, Wang Haiyang repeatedly betrayed and murdered his comrades, including Li Shixian, severely weakening the Taiping cause.
*   **Internal Conflict as a Cause of Defeat:** Wang Haiyang's actions, while seemingly benefiting him in the short term, ultimately eroded the unity and strength of the Taiping army, contributing to their final defeat.

August 22, 1865 The county seat of Zhenping, which was besieged by the Qing army for several months, was in Jiayingzhou, eastern Guangdong. This is unusually lively The tower is decorated with lanterns The county is also brightly lit. There's a faint noise of cheering It turned out that the commander of the southern Taiping army, Kang Wang, Wang Haiyang, had a son before he was happy. At this time the city is holding a full moon banquet Supposedly, the army is pressing the border. When a strong enemy is in the present, one shouldn't celebrate so selflessly. It's just that Wang Haiyang has no children. There are three so-called unfilial No rear is big Now I finally got what I wanted. I was overjoyed. Moreover, since this Taiping Army's southward march The war continues At this time of turmoil and low morale God-given Spirit Ear For King Kang, it seems to be a rare good omen. At this time, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom had already existed in name only. The prohibition, which was strictly observed before, is naturally useless. Days of bloody battle Everyone is physically and mentally exhausted If you get this opportunity, you'll all have a good time drinking. Drink Even 5 days before the twists and turns Wang Li Shixian, who has just taken refuge here. are equally enthusiastic Until I got drunk, I hobbled back to the house. Only the next morning the shocking news suddenly spread in the city. Lee Shih-hsien committed treason by the enemy and was put to death last night. Looking at the bloody heads of traitors All talents suddenly realize It turns out that last night's banquet King Kang repeatedly persuaded Li Shixian to drink It was intentional. And the full moon wine that seemed to be a guest and a host. It's just a Hongmen banquet specially prepared for the king. Why did Li Shixian go to Guangdong As a general of the Taiping Army, why did Wang Haiyang want to kill him? It all started a year ago Marked by the fall of the city of Tianjin in July 1864 The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, which lasted for 14 years, was officially declared dead. But the so-called hundred-legged worm, dead but not stiff After the capital was destroyed The anti-Qing struggle of the Taiping army is far from being stopped. Not only Hong Tiangui Fu, the eldest son of Hong Xiuquan and the young heavenly king of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom He was escorted out of the city by loyal king Li Xiucheng And there are several large numbers of Taiping troops outside Tianjin. entrenched in the southern provinces Ready to go At this point Chen Decai, King Fu of the Western Expedition, is leading soldiers to the 200000. From the mighty northwest In fact, it is circling in eastern Hubei. Prepare to pass through Anhui, Eastern Jin, King of Qin, Huzhou, Zhejiang After July 1864. The only remaining important stronghold in the hands of the Taiping Army on China's territory The auxiliary king Yang Fuqing and the gambling king Huang Wenjin have been operating here for many years. Support more than 200,000 troops Waiting for the recipient to go south The most powerful also belongs to the Queen Li Shixian Department. This man is the cousin of loyal Wang Li Xiucheng Ranked as one of the leading generals of the five armies of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom He was the No. 3 real power figure in the army at that time, second only to the two kings of Britain and China. In the later period of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, all the generals with heavy troops were separated from each other. Self-respect And Li Shixian has been occupying the rich land of Zhejiang. Soldier General Guang Sufficient financial resources And because it is far from the main battlefield in Tianjin Their own strength has not been greatly affected In 1864, Tianjin was besieged for a long time. Good friends gradually dried up And the Yangtze River Delta and Taihu Lake regions in southern Jiangsu, western Zhejiang and southern Anhui, which are rich places in the south of the Yangtze River. Because of years of war, it's all a thousand miles away. No pellets Thousands of Taiping soldiers are in a state of three meals and food. Only when you go to other counties to collect grain for rescue to survive the food crisis Li Xiucheng and Li Shixian agreed on a strategy for food preparation. In mid-February 1864, Lu continued to send troops from Zhejiang to Jiangxi. solicit grain After the autumn harvest, you came to Tianjin from southern Anhui. Who knows backfire Haven't waited for the autumn harvest Tianjin has fallen As the commander-in-chief of the Taiping Army Although the strategic task of raising food and grass has not been completed But at this time in Jiangxi, Li Shixian in addition to sitting on the headquarters of nearly 300000 troops There are also 100000 Rebels of the Tiandi Association who have defected from Guangdong. It can be said that Ma Zhuang is a strong soldier. After breaking through Tianjing The Hunan army began a frenzied killing and looting. According to Zeng Guofan's confidant, Zhao Liewen, later recalled On the day the city was destroyed, the whole army plundered I have no intention of still taking the overall situation into consideration Amid the chaos in the city of Tianjin Loyal King Li Xiucheng risked his life at night to escort Young Heavenly King Hong Tiangui Fu Escape from the Taiping Gate Fleeing by Xiaolingwei To defend the Qing army in pursuit Li Xiucheng divides the remaining 1000-plus people into two teams. More than 300 people in the team escorted the young master south. And he himself led the 700 man behind. Soon the defenders were overtaken and scattered. In the midst of the chaos, King Zhou was also captured alone. But Hong Tien Guifu's former army is still relatively lucky. There was no interdiction along the way. July 25 arrived in relative safety At this point Anhui Guangde still in the hands of the Taiping Army And safely arrived in Guangde His uncle Gan Wang Hongren Xuan immediately came from Huzhou with a large amount of clothes, silk and food. He then escorted King You to the safer base camp in Huzhou. Considering that after the fall of Tianjin Huzhou must be the next key attack target of the Qing army Huang Wenjin, the commander-in-chief of the Taiping Army stationed here, suggested entering Jiangxi in the west. Rendezvous with Li Shixian and Wang Haiyang Department there Then he went north to unite with King Fu Chen Decai to gather in Jingxiang to have a glimpse of Chang'an. Opening up the Northwest Base Area 28 August Taiping Army Abandons Huzhou and Marches for Jiangxi Before the sentence Hong Renxuan Drafts Edict in the Name of Right Heavenly King Li Shixian's Department was ordered to pick up the car in Fuzhou, Gandong. Just from this day on Before the good luck has never seen Hong Tianguifu The crowd soon out of town That is, some people leave the army or sneak away to surrender their relatives. And Yang Fu, the auxiliary king, was separated from the army in the chaos. September 3 Huzhou army commander the most critical core figure of this team Huang Wenjin, the king of gambling, was seriously injured and died while fighting the Qing army in Ningguo, Zhejiang Province. And the biggest blow Or when the crowd went through a lot of hardships to reach the territory of Jiangxi Only then did I learn that Li Shixian had already led his troops south to Fujian. Only Kang Wang Wang Haiyang was arranged to attack Fuzhou as a partial division. However, Wang Haiyang, defeated by Bao Chaoting's army, has also retreated to Ruijin in southern Jiangxi. At this time, the exiled government abandoned by Li Shixian Although the people support the 123000 But morale is low The morale of the army is lax. Combat is also greatly reduced But Hong Renxuan is just a scholar. No experience in leading a war and lack the authority to command the whole army After the death of gambling king Huang Wenjin More do not know where to go Beleaguered on all sides, the wind crunched Panic like a lost dog Hurry like a fish out of the net Hu Zhou Jun lost in a row heavy casualties Plus chaos, dispersion, surrender and mutiny. After ten nights, there were less than 2000 people guarding the young master. And soon after Hong Renxuan and Hong Tianguifu were also captured by the Qing army. And shortly after the collapse of the Huzhou Army 14 November Another Taiping army, Fu Wang Chen Decai's army It was also surrounded by the Qing army's Sengeqin in Heishidu, Anhui. Eventually most of the 200000 surrendered. Fu Wang had no choice but to kill himself in the valley. At this time, the entire southern China still has the scale Li Shixian is the only one left in the formed armed forces of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. The Northwest Expeditionary Force of the Huzhou Army failed one after another. However, the Ministry of Li Shixian, which went south, went smoothly. While the Qing army focused their attention on Hubei, Jiangxi and other places While Fujian's forces are relatively empty of opportunity Shi Wang led the army to enter Fujian on a large scale. At that time, some people witnessed the grand occasion of the Taiping army going south. In the day, people's heads are like the tide, and the mountains and fields are blue. Torches at night are like long dragons winding Where Li Shixian's army general has passed Surrounded by more than 300 young people in the south of the Yangtze River, thousands of horses trod the ground. A moment of vivid thunder October 14, 1864 On the third day after the right king was captured Li Shixian led an army to conquer Zhangzhou, an important town in Fujian Province. When the value of hunger The surrounding unemployed and the bottom of the civilian population to vote. The king's momentum is even stronger. Millions of troops outside the city, hundreds of miles of battalion But this seemingly beautiful Taiping army has already been undercurrent surging. Its internal factions Many hills Although Li Shixian is the nominal commander But they can't control the whole situation. Especially Kang Wang Wang Haiyang This person belongs to Zhong Wang Li Xiucheng After the city of Tianjin was broken, he switched to Li Shixian's command because of his saint. After Shiwang first entered Fujian Wang Haiyang Keeps Jiangxi Ruijin Absorbed a large number of fugitive Huzhou Army personnel Its own strength is very prominent in the Li Shixian Corps. At this time, it is even more vaguely capable of competing with the world king. Earlier, Wang Haiyang was defeated in Fuzhou. Under his command, Wang Chen Bingwen took the opportunity to defer to the enemy. As a coach, Li Shixian has an ambiguous attitude. Wang Haiyang has already held a grudge. Wang Haiyang took in Ruijin and refused to follow Li Shixian. There are more than 30000 people in Sanjiang, two lakes and soldiers who have left their homes. It also caused the king's dissatisfaction. Zhangzhou for the Taiping army to live, after Qing Dynasty Shocks Zuo Zongtang, Governor of Fujian and Zhejiang, visited Fujian to suppress the Taiping Army. Great enemy at present Li Shixian and Wang Haiyang are two important commanders. There is also a disagreement over strategic direction. King Kang wants to go north to Jiangxi and establish a base area in southern Jiangxi. The Shiwang, on the other hand, insisted on moving westward into Guangxi, taking Guangdong and Guangxi as its stronghold. In the middle of the dispute, Zuo Zongtang's three-way army has already come to Zhangzhou. Li Shixian was defeated by Lu Wretched Zongtang in Zhejiang before. The army is pressing on the border, fearing that it will be difficult to support it alone. Contact in a hurry At this time, Wang Haiyang Department on the border between Fujian and Jiangxi Hope the other side to help Wang Haiyang's mercenaries have reached 100000 at this time. But in the face of the manager's call for help A heart grudge The second time also did not save strength To turn a deaf ear to military orders Subsequently, Li Shixian and the Qing army to engage Military defeat more than victory Southwest Fujian is also a sparsely populated and barren place. 100000 of men and horses are trapped in Zhangzhou The supply of ordnance, ammunition and grain is becoming more and more difficult. Only in May 1865 to the grass into the army Thought cover, hurriedly abandon the city west to go south The Taiping Army as the Last Viable Force of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom When I entered the life, I gathered a crowd of 100000. And Li, Wang two big coach in between the strong enemy But can't help each other Li Shixian Loses Zhangzhou In fact, the death knell has been sounded in advance for the final destruction of this force. Li Shixian's Ministry, which evacuated Zhangzhou, fought every day for the next 12 days. And undefeated without a fight There is a place in front of the regiment to practice the interception. After that, there was a Qing military rank and a straight chase. The situation is very mess Withdrawn to Pinghe County in mid-May In pursuit of the Qing army, the mountain roads here are rugged and cramped. The Taiping Army fled in a hurry. The crowd is congested and trampling on each other. There are countless people who fall from the cliff and fall into the water. 26 May Li Shixian led the remnants to escape to Yongding When the stream is soaring All three pontoons were washed away. Li Shixian's main force failed to cross The Qing army followed and killed The team was suddenly in chaos. Under the attack of the Qing army quickly fell apart Tens of thousands of people drowned and surrendered And coach Li Shixian risked his life to seek a water shore. cut and shave hair Hiding in the mountains just dodged a bullet Just as the king of the world and the Qing army were fighting hard Kang Wang Wang's marine department was given a short and valuable opportunity to recuperate. With the defeat of Li Shixian Yongding The Taiping army from all over Fujian, which belonged to the king of the world, also came to the Wang Ocean Corps one after another. grew rapidly during this period King Kang also became the new commander of the Southern Taiping Army. But the good times don't last long Qing army after the elimination of Li Shixian Aim the gun at Wang Haiyang again During this period Tang Wang led his troops to the north several times, all of which were intercepted by the Qing army. After tossing and turning in Hunan and Guangdong, it is difficult for the provinces to gain a foothold. 15 June Wang Haiyang led the army to conquer the small town in northeast Vietnam, and the war was unfavorable. The future is slim Kang Wangyi is helpless Can only temporarily borrow the town flat small place to gather together In mid-August. Everyone thought that Li Shixian died after Yongding's defeat. But miraculously found Zhenping come to take refuge in disguise Facing the arrival of the former coach Wang Haiyang was greeted out of the city with an extremely grand ceremony, and the loess mat road Clean water to sweep the street Then the two men entered the city with horses. But then the outcome was even more unexpected. Li Shixian entered the city only 5 days later Wang Haiyang got drunk by drinking and feasting. and assassinate them at night Li Shixian, who survived the disaster, escaped the siege of the Qing army. But in the end, he did not escape the black hands of his own people. What's even more bizarre is that This is not the first time that Wang Haiyang has been frantic with his compatriots. Comrades raise butcher's knife Back in November 1864 Huzhou Army Defeated Ji Wang Jinai then fled to Fujian to seek refuge with Wang Haiyang Golden Love is the Preface of Loyal King Li Xiucheng He was also the deputy commander of the Tianjin Defense War. Wang Haiyang Fears Status Threatened Smear the king of seasons for the glory of the seller, and plot against the king of loyalty Kill it The following year in May Li Shixian Defeated Uncle Qi Li Yuanmao also led the disabled to vote, Wang Haiyang To maintain their own leadership Li Yuanmao was executed again for failing to defend the manager. Lee Shih-hyun comes back from the dead Wang Haiyang did not send troops to rescue Zhangzhou First, then more wrongly killed his book. At the same time, Li Yuanmao is also worried that the Shiwang will come to power again after the return. Therefore, one does not do two endlessly Just start first. fabricated an excuse to sell his country and defer to the enemy to give Lee Shixian his death But Li Shixian's death caused an uproar in the Taiping Army. Shi Wang is not a second-rate general like Huang Wenjin or Li Yuanmao. Before the destruction of Tianjin, he was one of the core five armies of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Later, he served as commander of the entire Southern Army. It is the only remaining military division of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. On identity, status, prestige, at that time no one can match the right. It can even be said to be the last hope for the revival of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. The so-called cold lips and dead teeth Rabbit Death Fox Sad The enemy is at hand, and the future is uncertain. Wang Haiyang, however, continues to slaughter his compatriots for his own self-interest. Not only let the crowd chill It also put everyone in the Taiping army at risk. However, it was Wang Yumi who took refuge before, and his resentment was even more difficult to settle. Soon, the serious consequences of killing the king began to emerge. Whether it's the headquarters or the city king's old department One after another, there have been a series of deportation. Even some of the generals rebelled. Later, he was appointed by the Qing army to continue to lurk beside Wang Haiyang. And all this laid the groundwork for King Kang's final defeat. After this rebellion Wang Haiyang's troops were damaged But there are still 100000 of his own troops around him. At the heart of it are a large number of soldiers from their hometown of Quanjiao, Anhui. All are brave and loyal people who are not afraid of death. Therefore, the strength of King Kang is still not to be underestimated. 27 September Fang Haiyang Abandons Zhenping I plan to cross Wuling and go north to Jianghuai via Jiangxi to join forces with Nian Army. But the Qing army was on guard. Set up heavy troops to guard the north and south of the five ridges. Taiping army after many twists and turns, not inch Can only helplessly wander in the border of Guangdong and Jiangxi On December 8, the year is approaching. Wang Haiyang was blocked from going north for several times. In order to take a trip to spend the New Year's rest. The tired teacher suddenly walked from Lian Ping to the east, racing for more than 200 miles a day. Taking advantage of the emptiness to capture the important town of jiayingzhou in eastern Guangdong Big out of the Qing army expected But then the Qing army arrived one after another. Zuo Zongtang also visited the town To surround this place Wang's strategic plan to go north is no longer achievable. Only to build a city to see the fraud ten pass garrison jiaying state city February 1866 Wang Haiyang built a city resolution, let it go From the east of the city to send tens of thousands of troops, and self-led Chinese troops The left side is Hu Yongxiang, who is resourceful and called Hu Blind. But the right side was not activated, confidant Tan Tieyuan or Wang Qixian. However, he arranged the commander-in-chief of Huang Peng, who had already defected. Wang Haiyang On the eve of the attack Huang Peng later arranged the troops and tactics of the Taiping Army. To the Qing army and tell the truth And told the other side to only concentrate their forces to attack the Taiping Army. The left middle road can signal the main force of both sides to come out. And foreign guns and artillery are all on the scene. Arrows like a shower Light like flying yellow On the battlefield, the corpse pillow ring Blood flows into a river And the Taiping Army soldiers are all Han Yong to compete for the first One after the other As a coach, Wang Haiyang also has a sense of prevention. When the charge There were also several attendants who were dressed in the same color and similar in appearance. to confuse But people are not as good as heaven. Ding Sun, a traitor familiar with Wang Haiyang, was in front of the battle at this time. At a glance, I recognized the former commander in chief among the rebels. Through the designation of Ding Sun The Qing army immediately concentrated on lifting dozens of guns. At the same time, fire at the bandit leader. Wang Haiyang was shot in the middle of his eyebrow, and the bullet came through his skull. King Kang fell off his horse in response and was robbed to the death by his own guard into the city. He died of serious injuries that night. King Kang perished, and the generals were leaderless. The armed forces are at a loss and have no basis. Although temporarily succeeded by King Tan Tiyuan as handsome But at this point, the morale of the army is falling apart. The tide is gone 7 February The remnants of the Taiping Army seem to break through the southeast of the state city. But the mountain roads are rugged and narrow, and there are many cliffs and deep streams. Under the pursuit of the Qing army February 11, 1866 The last Taiping army disappeared forever in the mountains of Lingnan
