what is the the number one thought and number one emotion that blocks us from the ability to manifest greater fear and so in some ways what we're talking about here actually is a decision between fear and love and when you're fearful this stimulates your sympathetic nervous system with all the negative aspects of it when you love you're open you're generous you're thoughtful you're kind because you've engaged the parasympathetic nervous system and you have a choice you meet people I'm sure say my life's miserable my life's horrible while the you're meet other people go well it's tough right now but I'm you know optimistic it's going to get better or I know if I do this it's going to get better these are completely oppositional attitudes that have a profound profound effect depending on what you're believing yes
