You can't imagine how scary it is for a student to roll up. There is a college student named Scott Yang who wants to start a company and become the boss after graduation, so he chose a business major. But after graduation, he found that what he learned in the four years of college was to teach him how to do business in a company. To put it bluntly, business and management jobs are still working for people, and he found that business tycoons like Bill Gates and Musk are all programmers, who can change the world by typing codes and get rich overnight, which aroused his strong interest But now he is faced with a dilemma.   He wants to learn computers , but he doesn’t want to waste 4 years and hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition fees. So he looked for free open courses at MIT , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and made a course list of 33 lessons. 2,000 dollars to buy textbooks , so he studied at home at his own pace. In the end, it only took one year to complete the four-year course of MIT. Although he did not really get a degree , he also received offers from some companies and developed by sharing the learning process. A small program Later , he felt that his method was feasible , especially the fine volume . He learned sketching within a month and learned four foreign languages, Xipu, Chinese, and Korean within a year. He was honored as the god of learning by many netizens. Through these multiples , Scott ’s super-speed learning was sold. At first , I also suspected that he was selling books by himself through these packages. But after reading it, I found that some of the learning methods in the book are simple and can be used by us. After all , self-study is not only about efficiency and quality , but it is all about persistence. It’s not easy. It’s estimated that many friends, like me, have thought about learning a skill by themselves, but in the end they can’t do it. So today we will talk about learning by combining super-speed learning and deliberate practice of cognitive innateness   and brain science. A general method for a skill Finally , I will share some learning resources at the bottom of the box. You can like and save them for later search . Self-study is not the same as learning at school. When we go to school , the teacher will tell us that we can at least read a newspaper when learning Chinese , and buy vegetables when learning mathematics. I won’t be fooled by others, but many times the purpose of our self-study is not clear , just like I wanted to learn painting for a while, it was purely a fever , and I didn’t bother to learn it after the fever subsided, so
we have to tell ourselves to learn this skill first Purpose How to arrange a study plan and install a navigation for the brain. The purpose is best to be specific and scene-based, so as to stimulate your own action. Don’t learn English. The purpose is rather vague . Whether it is to expand vocabulary or practice oral English will directly determine our learning focus and Method We might as well set goals like this. For example, if I want to learn spoken English, I need to reach the level of being able to communicate with foreigners on a daily basis, so that I do n’t have to look at the translation software all the time when I travel abroad and order 5 soups for meals. In addition , there is a smart principle in goal setting, which is to be specific Quantifiable, achievable , related to the action plan , and invalid. Among them , I don’t think there is any need to insist on quantifiable, because it is easy to simplify the real goal and fall into the counter trap , just like I read books before and asked myself to read 4 books a month . I read books like improvement If you don’t understand it, you can read it. The result is that it seems that the goal has been completed. In fact, it is useless. Since it is useless, there is no reason to stick to it. We can divide the study plan into two situations. One is that there is a certain foundation and enough self-discipline, then the plan can be put into practice. The more detailed the better , Scott spent 10% of the total learning time to make a detailed plan, including what content to learn, time arrangement, etc., and fine-tuning can be done   later according to the actual situation. Give up the preliminary plan before getting started. The simpler the better. After all, Xiaobai doesn’t know whether his plan is reasonable , and the more complex the system is, the more likely   it will collapse . Move first, and then adjust the direction later . The author of deliberate practice did an experiment. He found a student named Steve, and randomly told him a series of numbers each time, and asked him to remember and recite them as much as possible. If he remembers, next time One number will be added, and the counter will be reduced by two, and so on . At the beginning, Steve can only remember 7 numbers at most. This result is also in line with the capacity of short-term memory. But with continuous practice , he found an effective associative memory. The method is to connect numbers with familiar objects, so he broke through the bottleneck and memorized 9 and 10. Every time he encountered a bottleneck, he did not choose to stay in the comfort zone, but kept thinking about how to improve. The last time he entered 82 random numbers. Numbers So the author came to a conclusion that the way to make practice more effective is to get out of the comfort zone, which is also the most important principle of deliberate practice. Besides saying yes, there is also a misunderstanding about the source of knowledge. I used to like to read a few minutes to disassemble a book What kind of skills can I learn in a few minutes ? I think I can learn it when I see it. In the end, don’t talk about the content.   I can’t even remember the title. Reading classic original works or even academic papers is a painful process , but it can bring us a deeper understanding and brand-new cognition   that knowledge porters cannot provide. Pyramid Report The report pointed out that learning can be divided into two types: passive learning and active learning. Passive learning is a common method when we go to school.   Listening to lectures, reading, listening to demonstrations, etc. After two weeks , only less than 100% of what they have learned will be left in the brain. 30% of the content, active learning includes discussion, and the practice is taught to others. After two weeks , the remaining content has increased to 50% , 75% and 90%. This reminds me of the time when I was in school . Unexpectedly , it is also an efficient learning method, so when self-study, you can also use this method with friends with the same interests. We can think about whether the scene of chatting with friends about variety shows and ball games is more impressive than the content that has not been talked about before. Then it is practice. When learning to speak when I was a child, my parents did not deliberately focus on it, but I was in oral English every day. Continuous imitation and interaction in the environment is the real immersive learning. In addition , time can better expose the learning loopholes, just like playing basketball, training various movements every day , but only when you are on the court will you know how much you are. In the end, the learning efficiency is the highest. Accountability is the core of the Feynman learning method proposed by the physicist Richard Feynman . It turns out that it makes sense   for top scholars to like to give lectures to others . It can explain this phenomenon. Our brain is output-dependent . Compared with input learning, the brain pays more attention to output. He will feel that this information is frequently called, which is already very important . Although we can’t teach individuals to others every day when we are self-study, we can use the test. The form is like taking a school exam. In fact, every exam is an extremely efficient intensive study . A lot of knowledge learned in school is basically returned to the teacher after graduation. I can’t remember any of the texts I recited in full before. Why? University of California , Los Angeles The theory of memory application proposed by the Bjorks of the branch school, I think, can explain this phenomenon. They pointed out that people’s memory ability has two dimensions, one is storage ability and the other is retrieval ability. The storage ability will not weaken over time . It’s in my mind, I haven’t forgotten it in   essence , but why can’t I remember it? It’s mainly a problem of retrieval ability. If the stored memory is called frequently, the retrieval ability will become stronger, otherwise it will weaken . For example , a classmate you haven’t seen for a long time, what might you do? I can’t even think of his name, but when we met one day, you remembered it at that time, and the previous scenes are also vivid in your memory, so it’s not that the memory has disappeared, but it ’s hard to retrieve. According to the theory of memory application, every time the brain retrieves a memory, it corresponds to The retrieval ability will be improved once, and because this memory has passed another one in the brain, the storage intensity will also increase. This is why when you meet this classmate, you will have a deeper impression of him, so we know that repeated calls can be strengthened . Memory, but how can we achieve better memory effect through fewer recalls? Here are 2 tips . The first interval practice is a method in cognitive nature. It can deepen memory traces many times, such as reviewing homework a day Focus on reviewing for 8 hours, it is better to divide it into 4 days , 2 hours per day. In addition , the brain science of the exam mentioned an optimal review rhythm, we can also refer to the second one to create difficulties. Actually, I can’t figure out this method . But in an experiment, research The personnel asked two groups of subjects to memorize a list , did not interfere with group a, but repeatedly interrupted group b for 30 minutes after the test, and the results of group b were better. This experiment just proved the principle of necessary difficulty. The more energy we spend to retrieve a memory The storage ability and retrieval ability of this memory will be improved more, so we can try to switch the practice place, practice different skills interspersed , or use the lion memory method to walk back and forth while memorizing , even at a suitable low temperature and I practiced on a hungry stomach. Before I learned anything, I would buy all the relevant textbooks first. I spent a month reading the book and then went to practice. I couldn’t remember anything during the practice. I didn’t realize it until later. It is a very inefficient behavior, and it can even be said to be an excuse for procrastination. There is an efficient method called imperfect action. It is unnecessary to prepare everything before acting, but to act directly . Adjust and optimize according to feedback during the action. Deliberate practice Steve, every time he misremembers a number, the author will give him feedback immediately which
number is wrong or missed, so that he can pay close attention to those wrong numbers, know his weaknesses and make targeted improvements, so the book points out that no matter what he tries to do Everything needs feedback to accurately identify where you are lacking and why you have these deficiencies . What kind of feedback is more effective and efficient? There is an experiment in cognitive nature that proves that   delayed feedback is more effective than timed feedback . Research The staff finds two groups of students . Group A students take an open-book exam, which is equivalent to providing continuous feedback to themselves during the quiz. Group B can only check their answers after the exam. The test scores of Group A are naturally better, but they then take another exam for Group B. In fact , the function of appropriately delaying feedback is to give us one more chance to practice after a period of time . Although these 5 items are not typical methods for a certain skill, they only learn the generality of any knowledge and skills. Principles Let ’s summarize again . 1. Find a scenario-based goal that does not need to be quantified. The learning plan is specific or simple. It varies from person to person . 2 Break through the comfort zone. Try to use first-hand resources to study foreign languages ​​in depth and use professional translation tools. 3 Try to discuss, practice and teach these initiatives Learning method 4   Strengthen memory by appropriately creating difficulties and practicing at intervals 5 Find and value feedback in action. Feedback with proper delay is better. Next , it ’s time to share treasure learning resources. The following websites are basically primary learning resources Of course, because some addresses are abroad, you may need what you know
