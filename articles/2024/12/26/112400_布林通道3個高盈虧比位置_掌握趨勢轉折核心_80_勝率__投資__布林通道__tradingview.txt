Description:
**Summary:**

*   **Core Idea**: The video explains how to effectively use Bollinger Bands by focusing on K-line behavior at key track levels, specifically combining it with a custom MACD indicator for improved accuracy.
    *   **Lower Band**: Identifies potential rebounds or the start of downtrends, using MACD to confirm.
    *   **Middle Band**: Assesses if a pullback is temporary or if an uptrend is ending.
    *   **Mid-Band Rebound**: Analyzes the strength of a rebound to see if it leads to further uptrend.
*   **Important Note**: Large cycle timeframes (e.g. weekly) must be considered when using smaller cycle timeframes (e.g. daily) to understand the real potential of the trend.
*   **Conclusion:** Correctly interpreting K-line behavior at these three band levels, in conjunction with the optimized MACD, is key to identifying high-probability trend turning points, increasing overall trading success and profitability.

Bollinger Bands is one of the most useful indicators I have ever used. It can solve the problem of trend and support pressure and can also show whether the current is a shock cycle or a unilateral movement. However, 80% of traders do not really understand the use of Bollinger Bands. The method leads to making wrong choices on issues such as whether a breakthrough near the middle track is to cross the middle track or the trend ends, etc. It is unclear and finally abandoned. Today, the commander will share with you the trading tips of Bollinger Bands from difficult to easy. At the same time, combine the indicators written by Dashuai himself to increase certainty . You only need to subscribe to Dashuai's channel and see the end. Maybe this detailed explanation of Bollinger Bands will save your pocket! I will put the relevant indicators used in the description column below. This issue has a lot of core content and can be viewed repeatedly. First let’s talk about the indicator settings, open the technical indicators, enter BB, select Bollinger Bands and apply it on the main picture. Next, we will go to the favorites column. Select Dashuai MACD Optimization Settings on the sub-chart so that the interface settings are completed. The core of the Bollinger Bands is the changes of the K line near the three track lines. Although the middle track usually represents the current trend , the top and bottom The middle rail is not reliable when the stage or trend reverses. Even the middle rail of the shock cycle will rise and fall suddenly. Therefore, it is necessary to judge the current real strength and changes based on the current position of the K line instead of making subjective predictions. First, let’s talk about the Bollinger Band. Three important opportunities. Grasp these three positions and you can easily fill your pockets. First: When the K-line falls below the lower track of Bollinger Band, is the lower track opening or is it about to rebound? The lower track of the Bollinger Band is the support for the rising trend and the oscillating trend. When it falls to the lower track, there are only two ways. One is that the lower track opens and starts a unilateral decline directly. The other is that it immediately rebounds to the middle track. So how to judge whether a unilateral decline is about to start or is starting? Here we use Dashuai MACD optimization to assist judgment and increase the winning rate to more than 80%. When the price falls to the lower track of Bollinger Band , we will look at MACD optimization. If MACD optimization is above the 0 axis and is about to experience a dead cross or dead cross. In this case, the cross is the opening of the lower track, and it will continue to fall. In this case, it will follow a unilateral trend. The short-term trend will continue to fall while rebounding. The decline in the unilateral form is violent, but the duration is very short, because falling along the lower track will cause The opening of the lower rail is accelerating and the distance between the lower rail and the middle rail is widening. Once the kinetic energy of shorts is insufficient, they will start to rebound quickly. This decline is violent, but it is difficult to chase because once the lower rail is supported, it will quickly rebound toward the middle rail and it will be very fast. A rapid rebound can observe the strength of the rebound to the middle rail and the state of MACD optimization after rebounding to the middle rail. If the MACD optimization has reached the middle rail while the golden cross and white line are above the yellow line, then there will be motivation to continue the upward attack at this time. Do not open short easily. If the MACD rebounds to the middle track and is still in the dead cross state after optimization , then you should be careful to step back on it for the second time. Continue to step back on the lower track and get out of the W-bottom form to confirm if the MACD is below the 0 axis and has just experienced a golden cross or white line. If it is close to the yellow line but does not break through it, the possibility of rebounding from the lower track is very high. At this time, the K line rebounds from the lower track of the Bollinger Band. The target is the middle track or even strong. It can rebound to near the upper track, but this intensity is not sustainable because At this time, it is far away from the middle rail. Even if you want to rebound, you have to step back on the middle rail first or vibrate near the middle rail to level the middle rail. Only then can the market have the momentum to continue upwards, and then the market can quickly follow the upward movement of the middle rail. The second rebound : The K-line fell from the upper track to the middle track of the Bollinger Band. Is it a retracement or the end of the rise? In the rising market, the K-line will fluctuate repeatedly along the middle and upper rails of the Bollinger Band. Although it can accurately open short on the upper rail and fall toward the middle rail , there are two risks. One is that when the K-line attacks along the upper rail, The main uptrend is rising violently at this time, and it is easy to be forced to stop the loss. One is that even if there is no rise, it may continue to rise after a shock. The price/performance ratio is not high, and it is contrary to the trend. But once it effectively falls below the middle track, it will become a downtrend, especially In the case where the previous large-cycle increase was too high, the decline would be very smooth at this time and it would be easy to follow the trend and open short positions . So when the price falls to the middle track, will it be a step back or the increase will end? We need to observe time and space. If after the rise ends, the market chooses to remain in place with a narrow range of box oscillations and slowly shakes to the middle rail without falling much. In this case, the middle rail is the easiest to support. Once the middle rail rises, it will catch up with the middle rail and continue. If you go up, you can quickly rush to the upper track again. The purpose of such a high and narrow range shock is to repair the divergence of technical indicators. Take MACD as an example. This narrow range shock and sharp decline also show that the MACD column shortens and rebounds. The withdrawal not only avoids a sharp decline in MACD, but also completes a retracement and a turn from green to red . Then it will not be easy for the MACD line-column divergence to appear again after stepping back and forth on the middle rail. If it really deviates repeatedly, the upward momentum will weaken. In addition, Another characteristic of stepping back on the middle track in an upward trend is that it must be fast and the time period should be short, because the trend of the market is a consensus of everyone. If everyone believes that the market will continue to rise , then when some reasons cause a short-term stepping back, funds will The intensity of undertaking is definitely very strong , so if it falls to the middle rail near the middle rail, it will start to rebound quickly or directly resume the upward momentum the next day. This means that everyone agrees with the market and has a high degree of consensus, making it easier to continue the upward attack. If the market starts to fluctuate repeatedly after falling to the middle rail, especially if the previous increase is relatively high and the cycle is far away from the middle rail , it will be difficult for the middle rail to support the third: Can the K line rebound from the lower rail to the middle rail of the Bollinger Bands ? Continue the upward attack on the middle track? This is the most cost-effective position in the entire Bollinger Band. If the lower rail rebounds to the middle rail, if it can effectively stand on the middle rail , it will not continue downward to complete the trend. Starting from the middle rail and attacking the upper rail, you must consider whether the middle rail is effective in the big cycle. This is the decisive factor here, so when we use the daily line as the entry point, we must refer to the strength and cycle of the weekly line to ensure that the weekly line has room to rise. For example, the weekly line has stabilized at the lower track, and there is still enough distance from the middle track when it rebounds to the middle track. The distance or the weekly line has already flattened from the middle track. In the process of the middle track upward attack, at the same time, there is still enough distance from the upper track . The profit space range of a large cycle is the strength of the upward attack or the strength of the retracement of the small cycle . The resistance and support of the large cycle level will also be stronger and more valuable than the small cycle. When the large cycle has space and the small cycle station is on the Bollinger Band mid-track , and MACD optimization has reached the golden cross, the safety factor at this time is the highest. To summarize: The three important positions of the forest channel are actually the most likely turning points of the three trends. One is whether the K line will start to rebound after falling to the lower rail or go unilaterally. This is to judge the strength of the lower rail. The other is to step back after the K line falls to the middle rail. Or the end is to judge the strength of the rise. One is whether the K-line rebound from the lower rail can effectively stand on the middle rail. It is to judge the strength of the decline . In all markets, the real big opportunities are given by the trend, so understanding the above 3 points can help you. It is better to judge whether the trend has a turning point and find the position with the highest cost performance. The content of the Bollinger Bands mentioned in the content is to see whether it is long or short and how to combine large and small cycles, etc. I have talked about it in detail in other videos.
