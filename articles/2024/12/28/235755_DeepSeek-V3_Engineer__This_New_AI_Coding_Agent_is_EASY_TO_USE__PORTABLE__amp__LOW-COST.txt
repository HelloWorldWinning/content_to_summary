Description:
DeepSeek Engineer is a portable, customizable, single-file coding assistant using the DeepSeek V3 model, functioning as a command-line tool for file reading, creation, and editing through JSON-formatted tool calls, offering a simpler alternative to tools like AER, with the added benefit of being easily adaptable and not limited to just coding.

[Music] [Applause] hi welcome to another video so deep seek V3 has been making a lot of hype these days and I really like it because it truly deserves it and it's just a very good model I mean the API is super cheap so as with hype some tools to use it in different ways have also started to pop up and today I have one such tool and it's called Deep seek engineer it's an AI agent that's majorly focused on being a coder similar to Claude engineer which is also developed by the same developer as Claude engineer but it's not an instance of that it's like the Claude engineer V2 instead of the latest v31 because it cannot make its own tools like V3 it's only stuck with the tools that are already added to it so let me just tell you everything about it and how it all works but before we do that let me tell you about today's sponsor photogenius ai photogenius ai is an all-in-one AI powered art generator that allows you to type anything and get stunning visuals instantly photogenius AI gives you all kinds of image generation models in one place whether it be flux stable diffusion cardinski or any image generator model that you can think of not just that it also gives you the option to do Advanced AI image editing as well with their cool AI tools like an AI Avatar generator background removal logo generator Emoji generator or even add an app icon generator and the best part is that it starts at only $10 and you can get an additional 25% off these already great deals by using my coupon code king2 so make sure that you check out photog genius. through the link in the description and generate some cool stuff with it so deep seek engineer is a coding assistant that is made to be used with the new deep seek V3 model it's an intuitive command line interface similar to AER that allows you to give it a task and it can read local file contents create new files and apply diff edits to existing files in real time it uses helper functions or tools to achieve most of the tasks and there aren't many of them but the basic ones which is what is needed generally it also takes all replies from the models in Json format and makes sure that it adheres to to Json output with optional file Creations or edits which is also good and you can also edit system prompts and everything like that it also maintains conversation history which is also good to see it's very similar to ader for most of the tasks although one thing that makes it super cool to use is the fact that it's all put in one file so all you need is this one file and it's super rep portable and you can use it and you can even customize it to your liking because the code is also easy to navigate through and you can even ask it to build itself because the code base isn't that large which is kind of cool now let me tell you how you can get it installed and how it all works to install it you can just get it cloned once you have done that you can just get in the folder and then you can just install it with the PIP install command like this and it will get all the stuff installed for you once it has been installed you can just start it by running the main python file but before you run it you'll need to export the Deep seek API key like this if you are using deep seek via open router or some other place then you can just go into the main python file and change the base URL here you can also use it with hyperbolic free credits as well as well some people were saying in yesterday's video that they cannot see the Deep seek V3 model on hyperbolic well that's true because it seems that they have removed its listing from their site due to slow performance and they are working on bringing it back there but in the meantime you can still use the Deep seek V3 model through their API although it will be a little slow and it may go down sometimes because they are working on it as well so you can just enter the hyperbolic base URL here and then in this line change the model name to deep seek V3 once you have done that just export the hyperbolic API key in the Deep seek API key variable anyway once that's figured out just get it started and this is what it looks like you can see that here we can just ask it to do something or we can also manually add files to it by using the slad operator and along with that you can add the file here and it will be in its context but you can also ask it to do something and it can figure out what to add to the context itself as well so let's try to do something as well so this is a basic app let's ask it to make me a playable synth keyboard because it's a much more challenging thing to do and I like building it let's send it and see okay so you can see that it starts streaming the response from it here the responses are in Json because it takes the output from the model in that format because it's basically like tool calling similar to how clein or ader does it okay it seems that it's now done and if we look at the directory then we have the stuff we needed here which is great let's try to open it and let's try to use it okay so this is what it looks like although The Black Keys are not correctly aligned which is not so good but anyway we have the stuff here and it also works well which is also great to see we can also make it change stuff in it as well so let's ask it to add a simple heading to it saying King once we send it then you can see that it does that which is also great and you can also see the assistant reply here as well which is also good to see if we preview it then you can see that we have the heading as well which is what we wanted so that's great another thing that we can do is add files to it manually as well so I have a basic string reverse tool to that I want to add here so let's just write slash add along with the file name here once we do that you can see that it gets added to the context now which is great now let's ask it to make some changes to it I want it to randomize the character Arrangement after the reverse as well so let's send it now you can see that it again starts doing that as well let's wait a bit for it to finish and it's now done so if we try to run it then you can see that it starts and works well which is what we wanted so that's basically how it works the best part is that it's all just one file and you can customize it however you want which is really great to say the least because it will allow you to use it to customize it in any way like you can add in your own tools or even ask deep seek to improve on itself which is pretty amazing as well one thing that I also liked is that you can easily Port it to any folder use it there and just remove it without going through the hassle of installing something like AER one more thing is that it's not just limited to coding so if you just want deep seek to read some files or write some files or edit them then it can do that as well because it's not solely focused on just coding like what ader and Klein are focused on which is also great to see so this is a good option if you want to have something simple without a bunch of unnecessary things it's super portable and customizable overall it's pretty cool anyway
