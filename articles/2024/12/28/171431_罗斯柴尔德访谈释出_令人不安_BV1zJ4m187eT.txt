 And it begins with three words, dear Lord Rothschild. Why was it that this letter was sent by the Foreign Secretary to your great Uncle Walter? Jacob Rothschild, a name synonymous with wealth, power and influence, has long been associated with the creation of Israel. The story behind this connection is both shocking and intriguing as Lord Rothschild reveals in this exclusive interview. Stay with us till the end of the video to find out all the fourth Baron Rothschild has to say about this in his disturbing interview that has been released. The interview. In November 1917, British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour sent a letter to the second Lord Rothschild expressing the British government's support for a Jewish home in Palestine. This letter, known as the Balfour Declaration, changed the course of history for the Middle East and the Jewish people. The Balfour Declaration, a mere 67 words long, is a document that changed the course of history for the Middle East and the Jewish people. Sent on November 2, 1917 by British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour, it expressed the British government's support for the establishment of a Jewish home in Palestine. But why was this declaration addressed to the Rothschild family? To understand the significance of this choice, we must delve into the historical context of the time. The Zionist movement which aimed to establish a Jewish homeland was primarily a movement from Eastern Europe. However, there was no clear leadership or figurehead representing this movement. The British government, recognizing the need for a central address, turned to the Rothschild family. The Rothschilds were a prominent and influential family, known for their immense wealth and connections. They had a long history of involvement in various political and financial affairs. It was believed that their influence and resources made them the ideal recipients of such a declaration. Among the Rothschild family, the second Lord Rothschild, Walter Rothschild, was chosen as the recipient of the Balfour Declaration. Walter was an eccentric and colourful character with a passion for collecting. He had amassed the largest collection of ornithological material in Great Britain, showcasing his wide-ranging interests. However, it was Walter's deep interest in the Zionist cause and his involvement in the early years of the establishment of pioneer communities in Israel. Walter's commitment to the Zionist movement made him a natural ally for the British government in their support for a Jewish homeland. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the Rothschild family was not united in their support for the establishment of a national home in Israel. Some members, like James Rothschild, who had come from France, believed it was better to assimilate into English life and did not support the idea. Nevertheless, others, like Dorothy der Rothschild, played a critical role in advancing the Zionist cause. Dorothy, a major supporter of Israel from a young age, became instrumental in connecting with the British establishment and facilitating meetings with Zionist leaders. She married her cousin James Rothschild at the age of 17 and dedicated her life to advancing the cause of Israel after his death. Dorothy's passion, combined with her ability to navigate the highest echelons of British society, made her an important figure in the Zionist movement. The Balfour Declaration with its three simple words, Dear Lord Rothschild, marked a turning point in Jewish history. It was a testament to the power and influence of the Rothschild family, as well as their commitment to the Zionist cause. The Declaration went through several drafts and compromises before its finalisation, but its essence remained the same. A promise of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. The Declaration, as Jacob Rothschild went on to reveal in the interview, further expressed the British government support for the establishment of a Jewish home in Palestine. It was a monumental statement that held great significance for the Jewish community. The Declaration stated, His Majesty's government views with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object. These words were a beacon of hope for the Jewish people, who had long yearned for a homeland of their own. However, the Declaration also emphasised the importance of safeguarding the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. It was a delicate balance, ensuring that the establishment of a Jewish home did not come at the expense of the rights of others. This aspect of the Declaration was crucial in maintaining peace and harmony in the region. The Balfour Declaration was seen as one of the most extraordinary moments in Jewish history. It was a culmination of 3,000 years of struggle and perseverance. For many it was nothing short of a miracle. The idea that an impoverished would be statesmen like Chime Weitzmann could persuade powerful figures like Walter Rothschild, Arthur Balfour and even Prime Minister Lloyd George to support the establishment of a Jewish homeland seemed unlikely, yet it happened. As good as the Balfour Declaration sounded, the reactions to it were varied. Within the Jewish community it was hailed as the greatest event in thousands of years. It was a moment of immense pride and joy, as the dream of a Jewish homeland was finally within reach. The Declaration provided a sense of validation and recognition for the Jewish people, who had faced centuries of persecution and displacement. However, the Declaration also faced criticism and opposition. Some argued that it did not go far enough in guaranteeing the rights of non-Jewish communities in Palestine. Others questioned the motives behind the Declaration, viewing it as a political move by the British government to gain favour with the Jewish community. The implications of the Declaration were far reaching. It set in motion a series of events that would shape the future of the Middle East and the Jewish people. The establishment of pioneer communities in Israel with the support of the Rothschild family marked the beginning of a new chapter in Jewish history. The Rothschild family also played a crucial role in the early years of the establishment of these pioneer communities. In France, Bernhard-Laud Rothschild responded to the Russian pogroms in the 1880s, providing support and assistance to Jewish immigrants. In England, members of the Rothschild family, like Dorothy De Rothschild, dedicated themselves to advancing the Zionist cause and connecting with the British establishment. Interestingly, Jacob Rothschild not only revealed events of the past. In another interview, he shared his views about the future and how it can be built. When it comes to architecture, few partnerships have been as influential and enduring as that of Jacob Rothschild and Norman Foster. Their collaboration spans over four decades, beginning with their initial encounter alongside Jim Sterling and Richard Rogers. It was a meeting that would shape the course of architectural history. Rothschild vividly recalls the first time he laid eyes on Foster's work. It was at Reading, where he witnessed the early manifestations of Foster's architectural genius, the buildings exuded a sense of innovation and forward thinking that immediately captivated Rothschild. Little did he know that this encounter would mark the beginning of a lifelong friendship and a shared vision for the future, but it wasn't just the world of art and culture that Rothschild and Foster left their mark on. Their collaboration extended to projects that aimed to transform public spaces and enhance the urban experience. One such project was the pedestrianisation of Trafalgar Square, a historic landmark in the heart of London. In 1989, Foster played a pivotal role in the realization of this ambitious endeavour, which sought to create a vibrant and accessible public space for all to enjoy. The successful completion of the project was a testament to Foster's ability to blend functionality, aesthetics, and the preservation of historical significance. Rothschild's admiration for Foster's work extended beyond their personal collaborations. As the chairman of the Pritzker Prize for Architecture, Rothschild had the privilege of being part of the committee that awarded Foster the prestigious prize in 1989. The decision was unanimous, as Foster's Millennium Bridge, a stunning architectural marvel that connected Somerset Heights, became a symbol of his ability to seamlessly blend the old and the new. So inspired by Foster's talent and vision, Rothschild sought his expertise in a project that held deep personal significance. The Baron Rothschild's greenhouse, once a sprawling oasis filled with exotic orchids, had been destroyed decades ago. The question of what to do with the site weighed heavily on Rothschild's mind. Together with Foster, they envisioned a project that would explore the future of farming, a subject of great importance in an ever-changing world. Their plan involved creating a modern structure on the site of the old greenhouse, showcasing innovative farming practices, and addressing the pressing issues of sustainability and food production. Simultaneously, they aim to preserve the historical significance of the stable, and 19th century building by incorporating a modern intrusion that would juxtapose the old and the new. This harmonious blend of tradition and innovation would serve as a proof to the power of architectural creativity and the potential for a sustainable future. The transformation of the Baron Rothschild's greenhouse site into a visionary space dedicated to the future of farming became a focal point of their collaboration. The greenhouse, once a sprawling acre filled with vibrant orchids, had been lost to time, but its legacy remained. Rothschild and Foster saw an opportunity to re-imagine the site and address the pressing issues surrounding agriculture and sustainability. In essence, the future of farming had become a live subject, and these two visionaries were determined to make a meaningful contribution. Other interviews.

The family story begins with Maya Amschel. Rothschild, a man who would lay the foundation for one of the most influential banking dynasties in European history. Born on February 23, 1744, in Frankfurt, Amman, Mayer came from humble beginnings. His family name Rothschild derived from the Red Shield on the House in the ghetto where his ancestors once lived. Intended for a career in the rabbit, Maya's path took an unexpected turn when his parents passed away at an early age. Forced into an apprenticeship in a banking house, Maya quickly learned the intricacies of finance and developed a keen business sense. It was during this time that he became the court factor to William IX, the land grave of Hesse Castle. Father as many sons as possible who could take care of the family's business affairs abroad. Amschel Mayer, Salomon Mayer, Nathan Mayer, Karl Mayer and Jacob Mayer. Together they formed the foundation of the Rothschild dynasty, starting as dealers in luxury items and traders in coins and commercial papers. Mayer and his sons quickly gained recognition for their financial acumen. Their reputation grew exponentially during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars of 1792 to 1815. The wars presented the Rothschilds with unprecedented opportunities for financial gain. Maya and his eldest son Amschel oversaw the growing business from Frankfurt while Nathan established a branch in London in 1804. Jacob settled in Paris in 1811 and Salomon and Karl opened offices in Vienna and Naples respectively in the 1820s. The Rothschilds capitalized on the wars by providing loans to warring princes, engaging in smuggling and legal trading of key products and facilitating international payments between the British Isles and the continent.
